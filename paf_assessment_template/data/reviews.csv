2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,2900140,Eva,"The location of this airbnb is just perfect. You can walk to town, to the beach - the neighbourhood is quiet, and the people are really friendly. Feels like a proper getaway from the busy city life. Perfect space for me, my partner and our little puppy dog. Highly recommend."

2018-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Garth,"Thanks for the fantastic accomodation Vickie. Very clean and loved the personal touches, such as welcome chocolates and the fridge stocked with  milk, water, etc. The location was perfect, with everything being within a short walking distance. The flat was very quiet too which was surprising.  
Vickie was the perfect host and very good at communication. Thanks again!"

2017-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Lingshuang,"First time in Airbnb, Kath’s apartment is really clean and warm, Kath was away in the first two days, her friend Kane helped us with checking in, and Kane is friendly. Kath’s adorable dog Ruski is really quiet and friendly, I like him!"
2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,Bart,"We enjoyed our stay as 2 couples with children, and Bundeena is a beautiful place to spend a weekend.
Hilde's place is downstairs from their residence which is great in case you need anything, but is private, and the back garden and pool are yours. Our children loved picking oranges and playing in the grass."
2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Clare,Susan's garden studio is the perfect place for a few days stay. The location is fantastic and it was lovely for us to sit out on the terrace and have a delicious coffee (Susan kindly provides Nespresso pods to use in very stylish cups!). They studio decor is beautiful and there were so many thoughtful touches. Susan was so considerate in helping us with an early check in. I couldn't recommend her place more highly!
2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,21939239,Alejo,The best place where I have hosted ever !! And Don have been the only Airbnb host who thinks in each detail to make us feel comfortable and plenty . Thanks
2017-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,10423504,Cameron,"Having previously lived in Bondi, we were pleased to discover Cat's quiet beach bungalow. Great proximity to everything in Bondi - just next door to the weekend markets at the local school, 3 minute walk to the beach. The house has lots of space - we had no issues with 8 adults and a baby. Cat was an excellent host. Enjoy your stay!"
2015-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Tanya,"This was a lovely property in a great location. Simone had left a comprehensive welcome folder and a bottle of wine, which was a nice touch. The property is just around the corner from The Spot which has a great range of restaurants and cafes."
2017-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Mandy,Angela is very kind and reply the messages to us is quick. she ready for everything is awesome! Her house is tidy and clean. It's very comfortable. highly recommend!
2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,12098138,Emma,We had an fantastic stay in Lizzy's apartment. The location was excellent and Lizzy was so helpful and accommodating (making sure we had some breakfast provisions after we arrived late at night which was so very much appreciated). The apartment was more than spacious enough for our family of 5. The worst thing about this apartment was having to leave those amazing views behind when we left! I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone else and would stay here again.
2018-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,21999107,Ray,"Fantastic location near the beach, harbour and restaurants/bars. All no more than 5/6 minutes away.
Lovely apartment with beautiful garden."
2018-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Tanya,"This place is centrally located, super clean and well equipped and also very secure for the solo traveller. I was able to catch a train from the airport and walk only a couple of minutes to the destination. Nearby there are lots of restaurants and cafes, and I enjoyed the food from a different culture every meal. I would happily stay there again."
2014-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,501382,Barbora,"We enjoyed our stay in Louise's apartment this past January. The flat is really  fantastic, both beautiful and practical, very well equipped and pleasant. Louise and John were nice and helpful.  We would recommend this place to anyone. Only one little note: Alison Rd is very busy and rather noisy at the peak hours."
2016-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,1944996,Michael,We come to Sydney every month for work – and this is the best Airbnb we've stayed in yet. Will definitely be back! :)
2018-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,25977467,Jessica,"This is a really good sized one bed apartment for two but could easily fit two more in a sofa bed. It’s nicely decorated inside and has a cute little balcony. There was everything we needed inside - well kitted our kitchen for cooking our own meals and toiletries etc. Really comfy bed! Communication was super quick and really clear. The location is perfect for accessing the darling harbour area. We had a great two night stay, I would recommend this place."
2018-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,16813942,Georgia,"Great location, just off the beach. Good bedrooms not adjoined. Simple house for a beach holiday. Thanks for the weekend away and opportunity to relax."
2017-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,15745971,Sarah,"Lovely apartment in a great location, perfect for a weekend break in Sydney. Communication with Mohit was easy, a highly recommended host!"

2017-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,8356824,Kristine,"Sandra's apartment was very clean, comfortable bed, when you opened the windows a great breeze came through, for it was very hot in Sydney while we were there for the weekend. Very close to everything, beach down one street.
Near the famous Icebergs club which is a must when you visit Sydney.  Would recommend for long or short stays thankyou to Sandra for having my husband & myself. "
2017-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,12370710,Marlies,"Thank you so much for sharing your awesome accommodation, ""a piece of heaven on earth "" ! Hope to come back one day... "
2018-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,20374683,Chloe,Nice clean apartment. Was nice and central to everything we needed. We had a great stay.
2016-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Sasha,"Victoria's place saved me from a terrible previous Air b&b experience I was in. It was extremely clean, comfortable, quiet, and relaxing. She was more than helpful when I arrived and had great pointers on what to do in the area. I wish I could've stayed longer! Highly recommend her place."
2018-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Cyndy,Fantastic location and a lovely place to stay when visiting Sydney.

Thanks"
2017-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,6201263,Regis,Great location and friendly atmosphere in this big group house with young international people!
2016-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,7549277,Jo,"We have just returned from our trip to Australia and our stay at Beacon Hill. From the moment we entered the property we knew we had found our home for 3 weeks. The house had been carefully prepared to make us feel that we were not intruding but feel at home. All spaces were organised clean and of a very high standard. Communication with Mari has always been fast and informative. Our stay in Mari and James home has been a pure pleasure and we are so happy that we had the opportunity to share in their home. We had full access to all the house which made our stay comfortable and relaxed. 
The outside space for entertaining was excellent and the beds, linen towels and use of washing machine, dishwasher etc made for a very comfortable sleep and stay. We have 2 teenage sons so the extra space the house gave was very important for our trip as were spending quality time with our sister who lives in the northern beaches.
We were met by Mari 's mother who was so very welcoming and there was no problems at all during our stay. We would all recommend this home as a choice on AIRBNB
WITH REGARDS JO AND PAUL STEVENS"
2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,23222456,Phillip,"Donna is a very welcoming host and also very friendly. She was helpful all through my stay and very polite. 

The location of the place is far out of Sydney central but very close to the train so very easy to get there and back from most places in Sydney! 

The price of this place is very cheap and well worth it! I highly recommend this place!"
2015-06-15T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Su-Yin & Simon,"We booked Fred & Bernadette's lovely apartment for my parents, who stayed one weekend in June. Because we live in the area, it was nice that they were so close to home, and experienced what Malabar-life is like. My mum even went swimming twice in the rock pool! The apartment was great - nicely furnished, in a scenic location and well-heated. They really enjoyed staying there. Breakfast items - tea, coffee, Milo, Vegemite, milk, orange juice and cereals were also provided. We will definitely book their place again if we ever need to!"
2016-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Arthur,You would enjoy Victoria and she is very helpful with any suggestions on what to do in Sydney and questions and help with anything to do with Sydney.  Enjoyed her company as well.
2018-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,23428550,Lotte,Awesome
2017-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Glenda,"We LOVED this place!  It was sparkling clean, central to the ferries, the Rocks, the botanical Gardens and the Opera House.  We appreciated the size, with two big windows on the top floor and all we needed for a very comfortable stay.  The water was good and hot, the wifi was good, the bed comfortable.  We would definitely go back and will recommend Jared's place to friends."
2016-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Naoka,"Luke and Paul's lovery apartment felt like a home away from home, making our stay warmly welcomed.  A comfortable bed to sleep on, a view of rush green, a smell of freshly baked goodies, a sound of vital city (Website hidden by Airbnb) was all so perfect:). We would love to return again!  "
2018-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Siobhan,"On booking Chloe's apartment, I contacted her several times about check-in due to flights changing. She always got back to me within the hour and was very helpful with directions to her place (even sending pictures of the front door etc.) We had to get a very late check -in and she was very accommodating with this. 
When we arrived at Chloe's apartment it was exactly as it is on the pictures and was stocked with plenty of amenities (tea, coffee, breakfast goods, toiletries and tourist information). She had also very kindly left three Opal cards for us to access public transport easily, which we made use of.
Her apartment could not be more central as within minutes we were in the shopping area or The Rocks near the harbour. As this was our first time in Sydney, this made it very easy to navigate and see all the attractions we had intended to.
She had high speed Wi-Fi in the apartment and the rooftop pool and spa definitely relaxed us in the evenings. We also made use of the hotel restaurant which had very friendly staff and good food. On leaving our holiday the front desk organised a taxi for us and Chloe made the check-out very simple for us.
Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our trip and would recommend using Chloe’s apartment to anyone looking to visit Sydney’s attractions."
2016-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,8277472,Kym,"Elizabeth's hospitality blew me away.  The room and our own bathroom were immaculate and we had everything we needed for our stay.  Elizabeth was a warm and friendly host and also provided us with a lovely warm breakfast as part of the stay.
Glebe is an amazing area and Elizabeth's home is well located close to the shops, the light rail and Darling Harbour all being in walking distance.  
I'm so glad I got to stay in such a lovely home.  Thank you!"
2016-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,13689460,Shien,"Hayley and Jack were great hosts, and the location of the apartment was very convenient, within walking distance of bus stops and the train station. The bed was huge and very comfy. Thank you for having me! "
2019-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Kerry,"Shuang's place is exactly as described in the listing. The check-in and check-out process is super easy, which is great for the weary traveller! Convenient location if you want to be close to the international and domestic airports, plus within walking distance to the Wolli train station. The room was clean and stylishly decorated with little touches like mints. Bed is very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep! Very important if you have an early flight the next morning. I would stay again."
2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Julie,"GREAT LOCATION!  Easy walking to downtown attractions/ restaurants, etc. Large space, well appointed. I recommend it without hesitation."
2018-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,18083735,Lydia Evangelia,"We really enjoying staying at this cozy studio! Place was sparkling clean, had a fully equipped kitchen n toilet/bathroom, comfortable bed, fast internet etc! Greg and Maggie are excellent hosts, very discreet and gave us some great tips. 
Studio is close to everything, i would recommend it even if you have no vehicle. 
See you next time Greg and Maggie☺️"
2018-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Camilla,"We had a lovely time at Shuang's place. Everything was as we expected and more. It was nice and clean, and we had no trouble at all during our short stay there. If we need a place in the area some time in the future, I will definitely check if Shuang's place is available."
2018-04-12T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Erin,Millie's place is great. I have stayed here now 3 times. You can not beat yhe value and the locality
2018-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,20578419,Karla,"El departamento es como figura en las fotos, quizás un poco más chico de lo que pueden sugerir las imágenes. Una de las habitaciones es solo una división del salón, por lo cual no cuenta con la privacidad adecuada.  
Si bien la ubicación es buena, el departamento no tiene ventilación,las ventanas son fijas y el departamento tiene olor a humedad .
Por lo demás si no tenes presupuesto, esta bien."
2016-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Cathy,Really good location. Close to train station that and easy to go to the city.
2017-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,淑聪,"Cat’s place is amazing. It have a lovely yard and lovely plants in there. It is very close to the beach, just 10 min work. And Cat has a set of wonderful cook, the house is perfect for people who like cooking."
2015-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Eleanor,"I loved staying with Susan and Greg! The studio was well-furnished, and it provided the comforts of home. The fridge was stocked w easy breakfast goodies, and I was really enchanted by their gorgeous gardens. It's also a very quiet and nice area, roughly 5-10 minute walk to Bronte Beach.  From Bronte, you can do the coastal walk through to Tamarama and Bondi. It made for a perfect weekend away to be at the beach and living like a local, and with such lovely hosts. I would stay with them again given the chance. "
2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,5224098,Laura,"Tam is great! Super helpful and responsive, which was much appreciated. Especially when I lost my key 
Great location within a short walk of museum station and some cute restaurants near by. There was also a corner shop for milk etc which was useful. Very easy to get to from the airport. It was nice and clean too. Stanley Street is quite steep with wheelies but made for good exercise!"
2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Elise,Home away from home! This is a great place to stay when traveling in Sydney. The place is cozy and safe! It’s a wonderful place that feels like home when you are traveling. Lots of room and clean! Great stay
2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,20804897,Alex,"Staying at Emmy's place was okay, and I would recommend it for the price, which is probably the cheapest you can find around. 
The house, as well as the room, is probably not the greatest, but you're absolutely paying what you get. 

I only had two minor issues:
1) I thought that 'flexible check-in' meant: 'tell me when you arrive and I'll open the door'. It's not like this, at least not in this case. I was arriving at 11PM/midnight and Emmy informed me she couldn't check me in and asked me to find another place where to stay. The problem was I didn't have the possibility to book another room as I was boarding the plane to get to Sydney, and I didn’t want to arrive to a place I didn’t know, late at night, without even knowing where to go to sleep. Luckily Emmy found a solution and I was granted access to the house. I haven’t seen Emmy during my stay, but I saw Patrick, who I think manages the room when she’s not there. They have both been nice and for any issues I encountered they were there to help. The house is a boarding house, so although you’ll have a private room, you’ll be sharing it with other people. The ones who were at Emmy’s when I was there were very nice as well! 
2) The bathroom wasn't too clean and the room was a bit dusty, which made it difficult for me to sleep, being allergic to dust. As I paid a cleaning fee, to be fair, I was expecting a higher standard in terms of cleanliness. If I hadn't paid that, it would have been totally understandable. But again, as it is cheap and they are nice, I absolutely recommend staying at Emmy’s!"
2018-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Johnson,"Location-wise, David's place was conveniently situated close to some places of interest- only a few minutes walk to a couple of pharmacies, restaurants (McDonald's, Pizza Boccone, etc), groceries (Cole's and Woolworths), and some shops. It is also close to the King's Cross Train Station (only a 2-minute walk) and some bus stops. In terms of the home itself, it was very cozy and it didn't take long for us to feel at home. There was a lot of space for baggage storage, and it was generally easy to manoeuvre around. David was able to provide an assortment of breakfast cereals, coffee, and even tea for breakfast. Overall, this place would be one that I would gladly rebook in the future."
2014-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Tobias,We loved staying the B&B at Bronte. A beatiful and peacefull gardenhouse and garden and great hospitallity from Susan and her family. Bronte is a beatifull neighbourhood as well.
2018-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,24858356,Jason,"Great host that is hospitable and caring.  Place is nice, clean, fully equipped, and conveniently located.  Prompt responses and wanted to check up on my status. Very important for solo travelers. Great price for location.  When in bondi, stay at natasha's studio.
Jason"
2018-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,27009904,Zoe,"Tim & Mel are very friendly host. The place they have is so clean and new and stylish, and the best part is the location which is just few mins walk away to an underground train station which connects directly to CBD in just a few stops. 

They also provided us with snacks in the room which was a very thoughtful gesture and they also allow us to use the dryer and washer which was handy for us after we have traveled outside for a few days. Just a little drawback to the apartment is the construction on going at the opposite building which stop late at night and starts around 7 am in the morning, which Tim provided us ear plugs for. Not an issue for us, as we are quite an early riser. 

Overall, is a very good stay at Tim and Mel's place! If i were to come back to Sydney, I will definitely be back to stay with them!"
2018-03-10T05:00:00.000Z,20906161,Ville,"Superior communation with fast answers! Location is great, especially for flight passengers: trains are close and the apartment is easily accessible with luggages. Thank you!"
2017-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,18793287,Suzanne,"Stylish house, great location, perfect!"
2018-04-26T04:00:00.000Z,21612973,May Ling,Great stay.=)
2019-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,31002017,Linda,"An all you need apartment with good location close to store, bars and restaurants"
2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Kerry,Richards hospitality and beautiful home is an amazing place to stay for any occasion. We are seven women who appreciate great food and great environment. This is a perfect place to relax  read swim cook great food and be amazed by the views accords the water to Palm Beach.
2019-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,26308209,Christophe,"Thé place is convenient, very clean, located privately at the end of a very nice little backyard. The owners gave me useful orientation. Goodies were awaiting both on the pantry shelf and in the fridge ! They lent me a rechargeable bus/ferry card on top of a few maps. In case you lose some hygiene items, a number were available.  Air conditioning worked well. Place to park for me. Super."
2014-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Jon,"Arnie was a good host.  We didn't see all that much of him since we were out most of the time, but he was helpful in our short interaction.  He was also gracious about us waking them at 10:30 when we couldn't figure out the lock.

The house is old and interesting, and in a great location.  Very easy to get to many great neighborhoods in Sydney from his location.

My only complaints were having a shared bathroom, and that the room was right next to Arnie's own bedroom.  The close proximity didn't cause any issues really, we just had to be extra quiet to not disturb them.  There is another bedroom on the other side of the house which would have provided better privacy, but that was occupied during our stay.  The shared bathroom wasn't a major issue, though there was a couple times when it was unavailable."
2018-07-24T04:00:00.000Z,25977467,Lydia,I got this place on last minute and everything was absolutely wonderful :) The host provided very good instructions on everything and the self check in was extremely easy :) Thanks again.
2016-08-02T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,Rajitha,"Great and friendly place, loved the interior and balcony. Loved Rusty, the dog."
2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,20767798,Sheryl,great for a group and great location
2019-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Pamela,"Cathy’s place is a delightful gem. I felt I was staying in a cosy Greek studio...close to the water, beautiful trees and a leafy terrace to enjoy an afternoon drink. 
Cathy’s local recommendations were spot on: sunset at nearby Paradise Beach; walk to Clareville Beach; French restaurant in Avalon and local shops were all excellent. 
My three days were just what I wanted, sun, swimming, long walks in beautiful bush and a charming village...I felt re-energised. Cathy is the perfect host: welcoming but not intrusive. The breakfast coffee, yoghurt, berries and muesli were a wonderful bonus. Many thanks, Cathy."
2018-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,21568012,Yumi,"This place is good for the price! I loved my room. Very easy access to the city. A bit of construction noise, so I would suggest light sleepers to bring earplugs."
2018-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,20767798,Bruno,Clean and comfortable spot in the Sydney central business district. Location is great being less than a 5 min walk to Circular Quay and The Rocks.
2018-07-12T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Valissa,Rachel was great to communicate with. The house is very comfortable and has all you need. The beds and all linen are excellent quality. Pretty verandahs and a courtyard to enjoy. A great location!
2018-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,22536824,Stanislaw,"Calre is a great, communicative host with positive attitude. She loves her life, she loves Newton and is willing to show the neighbourhood, additionally she helps us to find ourselves in new city. Place was clean, warm and comfortable. What's more there is a cute puppy called Molly, one of the best we met :)"
2017-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Jeff,"Great hosts, very cosy, but not very private. We did not expect a house share with family and lodgers. It meant we could not cook and enjoy the lovely garden. Great location."
2018-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,16898275,Chantel,"Great location and lovely apartment. Very central. Only a 10min walk to the ferry station which goes direct to circular quay, walked from Bondi beach 35mins.  Would stay here again :)"
2017-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,18315277,Rogério,"A casa da Sarah é muito acolhedora e  a com uma excelente localização. Nos comunicamos pouco, porque em Sydney tudo é muito interativo, além de termos uma filha que mora por lá. Mas Sarah passou todas as informações necessárias e não tivemos necessidade de ligar para ela.
Um ótimo local para se hospedar. O único detalhe é que estávamos em três e para quem usava o sofá cama era necessário passar pelo quarto de casal para ir ao banheiro. Ideal para dois.
Outro detalhe é que seria melhor se houvesse uma pia/tanque na área de serviço."

2019-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,12256344,Gini,"Such a lovely place and village. Also, very good location."
2018-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Anne,"I had a super smooth and comfortable stay. Newtown is a great, lively area, and I wish I had more time to poke around. I had a couple of snags with travel (broken lock, etc.) and Michelle was able to help me figure out a solution. The food/dishes situation is a little un-orthodox, but everything is clearly laid out, and works exactly as the description says. It was clean, quiet, stylish, and accessible to many interesting spots to check out & eat at. Textbook example of easy, restful place for my quick trip."

2018-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,18047246,Franziska,Ven ist ein sehr netter Gastgeber und stellt euch alles zur Verfügung was man benötigt. Das Zimmer und Bad war super sauber und es gab nichts auszusetzen.  Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist nicht zu toppen. Wir würden sofort wieder kommen.
2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,Shane,Great location
2017-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,19641701,Wendy,Fabulous apartment in a lovely suburb of Sydney. Full facilities for a thoroughly enjoyable stay. Foolishly I had a lot of luggage and probably would have struggled with the stairs had my cousin not come to my rescue. Once my luggage was in the apartment the stairs weren't an issue at all. From the couch in the lounge room and the bed in the Main bedroom you can admire the spectacular harbour bridge and surrounds.
2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Rikke,"Bryan is a great host. Very friendly and helpful. His house is really nice, close to public transport - buses and lightrail. It seems bigger than shown at the photos. Super stay :-)"
2019-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Ami,"Very nice place, sparkling clean, host were lovely and extremely helpful. Will definitely recommend!"
2019-01-31T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Jaspreet,"Angela's place was inviting, cosy and contemporary at the same time. my family and I quickly settled in during our stay and felt very comfortable throughout our stay. The size and facilities for our family of 4 was perfect ( the washing machine, dryer and lovely garden was especially handy having two young kids) Our privacy was not at all compromised yet Angela made sure she was available for any questions or help we may have had. The amenities located around the beach house are excellent and all within walking distances. I will say pushing a stroller with a toddler in tow was particularly tiring when returning back from the beach as the beach house was located at top of a relatively steep hill. I would bare this in mind if you plan to not hire or take a car. Other than that, an excellent location, beach house and host!"
2018-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Pawel,"Excellent location, quick communication and confirmation. You can't go wrong"

The view over Pittwater is amazing with spectacular sunsets and the swimming pool, completely privat for me. Evelyn did all to make my stay very confortable. I thanks Everlyn to having me!"
2016-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Emily,"Simon & Nicole's designer warehouse in Surrey Hills was a perfect getaway spot for my husband and I. 

Walking distance from so much and they truly made us feel at home right down to the little details of leaving a comprehensive guide of what is close by and leaving little treats for us by our bedside!

Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone considering a holiday in Sydney."
2018-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Patrizia,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we have been very lucky to choose Desiree as a host. The apartment is lovely, very clean, confortable and well appointed. The size is perfect for two people and the location is very convenient, in front of Hide Park, easy to be reached by the airport via irport likn train that stops just few steps away. All the main city attractions are at walking distance. Desiree is very kind and supporting. You can easily reach her at any time via e-mail and she answers in a few minutes. Highly  recommended!"

And also David was a very good host and flexible with check-in."

2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Lauren,"This was a short one night stay in between flights and the location was perfect for this. It's modern, clean, and close to Wolli Creek station where there's lots of eateries. I would stay here again."
2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,12259367,Martin,"After reading the reviews I had high expectations about the apartment.
Yes the location is great but the apartment is ok. Way over priced for the quality of presentations offered.
Not enough towels for everybody, dishes and cutlery dirty, dusty furniture and kitchen, remote controls were not working, carpet floor dirty. We asked for shower gel as the one provided by the host was empty we got shampoo instead because ""no more available"".
When you pay $1,200 for 3 nights in Sydney you can expect a minimum of standard this apartment doesn't offer.
Disappointing."
2017-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Daniel,"Beautiful view, great central location with Milsons Point station just a few minutes walk away.
Charming place that had everything that was needed to make the stay a very good experience!
Communication with host was quick and easy, Millie seems like a lovely person.
Would recommend! :)"

2017-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,13852692,Chan,"Big house near Sydney center around 10 mins driving. Tidy, clean and wide space could accommodate almost 10 people. Most of restaurant, bar and groceries nearby. "
2017-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Sonia,"I had a great stay at Anita's flat. It was fully equipped and clean, even the shampoo and conditioner were provided in good quantities!  The location is perfect, the bus to the city stops right in front the building and its easy to walk everywhere in Bondi from here. 
Last but not least, Anita  remained available each time I needed it. "
2016-10-23T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Tony,Excellent experience. Room was great and the bathroom was awesome!
2015-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Garrett,"David's place was stunning! When we first arrived (two couples) David patiently waited for us on the street so we could find the place more easily, though there was no need with the listings accurate address and pictures to find it. David showed us around the beautiful apartment, which was even more lovely than the pictures, then gave us a quick overview of the area on a map before leaving us with the keys! The four of us slept amazing in the two beds and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay to tour around Sydney for a weekend! David was extremely nice and accommodating, and we would highly recommend staying at his place!"
2018-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Michelle,"Such a stylish little find. Loved the black and white theme of the house, it all flowed so beautifully. Great for short stays, no stove top etc but if you won’t be in the house for most of the day you’ll be fine. Also would’ve been good if there was shampoo and conditioner etc but just a note for next time. Make sure you come prepared!"
2018-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Mia,"it's very nice place , we enjoy  and will come again .thanks ! Vanessa"
2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,27716426,Jerome,"We both had an amazing stay the the Buxton House and really loved the Scandi-styled interior. Very clean and minimalistic! The place itself was cosy in the back of the house - it is an elongated kind of area, so could be quite hard to get things moving around. Nevertheless, we made it around comfortably. 

Neighborhood is safe, albeit hearing stories about walking at night around Refern. We had no troubles walking back to the apartment at about 11pm. 

There are lots of coffee and food options opened in the day and Buxton House is really close to Sydney Central with various methods there. Really loved the place and would definitely stay again when we're back in Sydney!"
2018-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,1143151,Patrick,"The apartment was as described and Eleanor was a great, communicative host. We had everything we needed during our stay and were within walking distance to everything we needed, including the train stations. Would highly recommend staying here if you’re looking for places in North Sydney. Laundry on site was definitely a plus. Thanks again!"

2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,22378312,Alexandra,Stayed at Lachlan’s place for a work trip for a week. The location is perfect only a 20min walk to the city and after work locally there are so many restaurants and things to do that it couldn’t have been better. The place is clean and exactly as the pictures show it to be. Lachlan was available for anything we needed. I would recommend this place to anyone and would definitely stay here again!
2017-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Dylan,Fantastic place.  Fantastic host.

2018-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,19238057,Daniella,The location could have been a bit closer to the tourist areas we wanted to visit. The train rides were longer then anticipated in listing. The train station was a bit of a walk with heavy luggage’s. But overall the area was quiet and  House was very comfortable and clean.  Daniel and Elena were very nice and respectful.
2018-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Lea,"Wir haben zwei Nächte bei MissD verbracht. Die Lage war super, Newtown ist sehr hip, mit vielen Cafés, Restaurants, kleinen Läden, fernab von den Touristenströmen. MissD war eine grossartige Gastgeberin, die Kommunikation war reibungslos und wir konnten sogar früher einchecken, was wir nach einer 30-stündigen Reise sehr schätzten! Wir empfehlen dieses Airbnb sehr!"
2017-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,19508741,Christian,"We were on a cycling trip around Kuran-Gai National Park and decided to stay around Newport for the night. Tessa And Rod’s place seemed like the perfect fit and it sure was.

Communication: Very easy to organize everything. It only took a few moments to organize our arrival and they were both there (and Charlie the dog :) to greet us when we arrived.

The place: It is a very cozy unit below their house. It was very peaceful and quiet. TV had Foxtel and it was nice to just chill and watch the news. Heaters were provided and very welcome as the weather git a but chilly.

Breakfast: Muesli, milk, tea, fruit, and homemade marmalade and toast - what else can you ask for! It was very nice to have access to these things.

Cleanliness: Very clean and very well kept! 

We cannot recommend this place enough, and if we ever decide to have another cycling trip close to the Northern beaches, we'll definitely stay here again. Thanks for everything!"
2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Sally,"Beautiful property with stunning views and beautiful pool! So many amazing beaches to check out around the area. Awesome Wholefoods cafe within walking distance of the house that we visited 3 days in a row for brekky (best smashed avo ever)!! Evelyn and Anthony provided a bottle of wine to welcome us which was lovely. As there is no oven in the unit, Anthony was kind enough to let us use his oven upstairs one night. Not a lot of phone reception in the area but the property has great wifi included! The bed was super comfy and shower pressure was awesome. 
Thanks :)"

The view is just stunning and the house is very nicely decorated with all the essentials. Loved that the house had access to a private beach. Bailey was so easy to communicate with and always replied promptly to any questions. Thank you for making our stay so lovely.
2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Lauren,"Cat's place was perfect for our girls getaway.  Amazing location, right next to Bondi Beach with a market and Harry's Expresso on the corner.  We walked everywhere.  Lovely, clean and funky décor, great outdoor entertaining space and plenty of beds.  Loved it, thank you."
2015-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Carly,"We stayed in this apartment for 2 nights over a weekend and found the location excellent. The apartment has great views of the beach.

2014-09-08T04:00:00.000Z,781631,Isa,"Mike is a great guy, he will make you feel welcome. He was good to chat to.
I had a pleasant stay - as I had finished work earlier, I had a nice break, and being in Potts Point is the best place for a holiday. The flat is in a great location, near some of the best restaurants and cafes in Potts Point. Its a beautiful area for walks around the neighborhood, near the wharf. The flat is older style, but in excellent condition. There are magnificent 360 degree views on the rooftop! I recommend this place for your stay!

2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,9810515,Georgia,"Andrea is most helpful and provided us with information on public transport and other things when asked.  The apartment is only a short walk to many things including the botanic gardens, Sydney opera house and circular quay."
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Jonathon,We spent an excellent long weekend at this lovely spot. Even with six adults and two small children the place felt spacious. The house had everything we needed and more. You couldn't be any closer to the beach and Great Mackerel is a prefect location.
2015-06-26T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Suzette,Jared and Diana were very accommodating hosts. The location is wonderful with nice shops and restraurants at your doorstep. The apartment is comfortable and very quiet.  I spent 6 nights here and greatly enjoyed my stay!
2018-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,22020910,Leah,"Exactly as described. The location was spot on, the apartment was exactly what was pictured. Anita went above and beyond to make sure that we were comfortable and provided additional information as first time guests to Australia. ie. public transportation. We arrived much earlier than check-in and she allowed us to leave our luggage at the apartment while we explored the beautiful Bondi Beach. Everything was provided in the apartment. There was no additional stress to locate sunscreen, beach towels, beach chair, even a beach hat was available! Comfortable cozy place, cozy bed, and it was so lovely waking up in the morning to see the beautiful sunrise off of the ocean while sipping a cup of coffee in the comfort of our room."
2019-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,24460964,Michaela,Anton’s place is right near Central Station and is great value. Lots of good little cafes nearby. The apartment has two tastefully decorated bedrooms with a new kitchen and city views. Beds were super comfy - thanks Anton for a great stay.

2017-06-16T04:00:00.000Z,19238057,Trieu,"Only stay here for one night but wanted to stay longer. Arriving late on Thursday night, we were warmly welcome by the host couple. Daniel and Elena were super hosts I've ever had as they fulfilled beyond our needs, so friendly and generous couple. We were invited to have a late meal with them too and apparently Daniel is a professional chef because the food was just amazing. Thank you isn't enough for these wonderful hosts. A truly enjoyable night. We will surely be back. "
2018-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,5923031,Karla,"Bom apartamento, bem funcional. Perto da estação de trem, com lavanderia e AC. Acesso só por escada, com malas pesadas acho que seria o único contra. O chuveiro também achei baixo e só tenho 1,70m. Mas ótimo custo benefício."
2018-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Stephen,"One of the best Airbnbs we've ever stayed at. Great location, and a perfect space for a Sydney getaway.

I was in Manly completing my open water diving certification and he was great with the flexibility of our schedules for the day. His location is close to the Corso and 2 beaches. It really is an amazing place to be. Thank Jonny for also being supportive with Zoe. I would recommend him any day. "

Andrew is an excellent communicator who responds quickly, and the check in process is super easy. I would recommend this as a great spot to base yourself and go exploring all that Sydney has to offer."
2018-06-22T04:00:00.000Z,22412815,Colleen,"The house was a great size in a good location for our group. It had most things we needed except hot water system broke down the last morning but that is an unpredictable.

2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Sally,"Had the most amazing 3 week stay here . 

I can't recommend the train enough. 

If you love peace and tranquility this is the place for you.

In the most beautiful setting. 

John and Margaret are perfect hosts.

I felt at home as soon as I arrived from the Uk.

The train has everything you need for a very comftable stay with lots of little personnel touches to.

Margaret provided me with some lovely things for breakfast upon my arrival .

I will always have the fondest of memories of my stay there and was sad to leave easily could have stayed longer ."
2018-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Angie,"What an incredibly beautiful location and charming beach house!! We were a group of 8 and found the house cosy and inviting with plenty of space for all of us to relax. Before our trip most of the group had not previously heard of Mackerel Beach, but it has quickly become a favourite destination in Sydney. Richard and Claudia are great hosts and were in touch before and throughout to ensure we had everything we needed. It’s not a matter of if we’ll go back but when! I have already recommended this property to family and friends. Thank you! It was a very memorable weekend away for all of us and the beautiful space you’ve created was a big part of that!"
2017-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,888107,Tom,"Nice house and friendly hosts. Quiet neighbourhood and easy to get into town, would recommend and stay again "
2018-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,19508741,Annie,"Tess and Rod are just the lovliest people.   A fresh loaf of bread and home made jams and muffins and other breakfast goodies awaited us on arrival.  you actually have a totally separate lounge, bathroom, and bedroom.  As well there is a fantastic sunny open patio area, complete with a fishpond, beautiful flowering creepers and local frog (although we coud hear him we couldn't see him)!! All of this is the deal! We would definitely recommend, and would love to stay again if the situation arose. Thankyou Tess and Rod!"
2016-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Devin,"Great stay in Sydney and couldn't be happier with the acomodations. Even though this was a shared rental, it felt incredibly private. Upon showing up accessing the unit was super easy, and everything a hotel would provide for was provided by this rental. Overall very happy with the experience and would stay again!"
2018-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,23312848,Maria,"We had a great time in North Curl Curl and loved staying at Richards place. We had everything we needed. Coffee, tea and little treats when we arrived. Amazing. Communication was really quick and efficient. Not used to having a shared entry with the host, but that was not a problem at all. We had all the privacy we needed. The beach is really close and the view is amazing."
2017-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,19376053,Jass,Great location and space. Beds were comfortable!
2016-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Paul,This home is truly one of a kind. I enjoyed staying at Arnie and Lorraine's unforgettable home. The room was great and the Paddington location was a great base from which to explore. Highly recommended.
2017-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Edwin,Really nice room with enough space and interesting environment :)
2018-04-25T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Patty,"We had a great stay at Victoria’s apartment! We were in Sydney for almost a month as our daughter had just had her first baby and the apartment was perfect for a number of reasons. It was in the perfect location being only a 5 min walk to her place as well as the best street in Potts Point! Just one block away were our favorite places to eat on Challis Street.... Fratell’s, The Fish Shop and Fejays.  Across the street is a great grocery store ... Woolworths.
Every Saturday is a wonderful open Market up the street with the best corn fritters I’ve ever had and more. The Kings Cross train station is only 5 min away as well, which made getting around super easy.
Her apartment was very clean, bright and comfortable. For being a studio we were a little concerned it may feel cramped for a month stay, but it never felt that way and a lot of that had to do with the the wall of windows that had a great view overlooking the trees and the city.
The shower was a little tricky as it was small and you had to step up to get into it, so we bought a small shower mat and that did the trick so there was no more fear of slipping! 
Victoria has really thought everything thru as far as utilizing her space for the best efficiency and added great touches with all the amenities.
We will look forward to staying there again on our next visit to see our daughter and family!"
2017-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,10091713,Tegan,"This is a lovely, clean apartment in a very central location. Close to public transport and everything else we needed (e.g. Supermarket, cafes, restaurants). The apartment is very spacious for two people and the view is amazing, we even had a great view of some fireworks on our last night. I would definitely recommend this place. Ben was also a great host and easy to communicate with!"
2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Emma,"The location was great for our overnight trip visiting Palm Beach and surrounding areas. The bathroom with it’s clear roof gave amazing light and was a nice novelty.  The house had more of an older cabin type vibe, although the bathroom was really modern and white and clean. Check in was really easy with the lock box and we booked the day of and got a response within the hour. Great service."
2017-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Lylyan,Verything was perfect!
2017-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,15332652,Louisa,"Lilian's place was just perfect. Gorgeous, clean and super central. I didn't meet Lilian in person, but her brother was kind enough to let me in and was only ever a text away (Lilian was put if town). Probably the best place I've stayed in Sydney! "
2017-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,20767798,Sarah,The apartment could not be in a better location if you wish to explore the heart of the city.
2017-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,17757543,Kerry,"Na is a warm and welcoming host. I will be back next year. The accommodation is very conveniently located for anyone needing somewhere in the Campbelltown area. With your own entrance and security lighting, it was easy to come and go. The water was warm and had excellent pressure for showers. Thanks again"

Lots of places to eat around, shops are close by and the apartment has everything you need to feel at home. I would for sure contact David again if I ever get back to Sydney. "
2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,21127680,Wendy,"We had a great (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was great and respond was always fast.
The place is great and better than the pictures as they we’re taken in the evening.
The location of the appartment is great"
2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Lucy,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2017-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Michele,Jared's apartment is in a perfect location so close to the centre of  Sydney and also to the train stations. It is ideal for a couple. Small but we found it ideal for us and definitely value for the cost. The bed is very comfortable. It is a bit noisy at the moment with road construction going on but I still slept very well and I'm a light sleeper! Just used ear plugs. The bathroom is a bit dated but the shower works well.  Check in and out was easy and apartment very easy to find and secure. Would definitely stay again if returning to Sydney. Jared is a great host!
2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,James,"Five star, book this wonderful apartment with confidence. Super host (Anita) who takes great pride in the property and service that she provides.  The apartment is modern, spotlessly clean and wonderfully located - everything in Bondi is no more than a 3 minute walk away. My wife and I had 7 wonderful trouble-free nights at this property and it will be our first choice when we return."
2016-06-10T04:00:00.000Z,12370710,Hayden,"Very well presented and an amazing position !


"
2017-03-12T05:00:00.000Z,10091713,Emma,Ben's place is centrally located with a great view of the Sydney skyline. The place looked exactly as it did in the pictures and was the perfect size for the two of us. Ben was a great host -- always quick to respond to my messages and happy to answer any questions. I would highly recommend this place.
2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Shekhar,It was a very pleasant stay. Thank you Shuang for your hospitality!
2019-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Viren,Anita’s place is excellent. Great location with everything you need.

2017-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Allan,A very large home that can genuinely handle a larger group. Lots of retreat areas so people can spread out. Location is the quintessential waterfront Pittwater experience. The host was good on the communication and any issues or advice quickly addressed. Highly recommend this property
2018-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,23510317,Sheree,Excellent location. Check in smooth and easy! Great stay
2014-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Francesca,"Location, room, security, comfort etc are all great. Natasa as a host is what makes this more that a place to just crash. She is a very sweet woman who gave us some great insights into the city. She even showed us the best (and secret) place to get front row for the NYE fireworks overlooking the bridge and harbour. 

With this being the first Air bnb experience for us we were a little anxious, but as soon as we arrived, we were sure we had made the best decision.

Travellers may want to consider a rail card if choosing this location as it saves lots of money for those staying a few days or more. "
2017-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Marcel Alexandre,"Hernan is a very nice guy and his house is very tidy and cozy. My wife and I just spent one night there, but we were really welcomed and we enjoyed our time there.

We recommend Hernan's place. Five stars for sure."

2018-03-27T04:00:00.000Z,18620288,Susie,"Fabulous location, only a few minutes walk to North Sydney ferry stop. A 15 minute walk to many Kirribilli restaurants and cafes. The apartment is very comfortable and well equipped. There are all the little added extras, that you don’t get in a hotel. Views of the harbour are beautiful. We had beautiful weather 17-24 degrees. If it was a hotter evening, the apartment may have been a bit warm, as there is no aircon or thru flow of breezes. We would definitely stay again, but not in summer."
2017-12-23T05:00:00.000Z,22335017,James,"Imran was friendly and hospitable, and I slept very well in the bed in the large room.  The apartment is very close to North Sydney station which so convenient and wonderful when travelling to things in Sydney.  The room is also great value. The apartment has simple decor and is in an old block of flats, but the other benefits more than make up for it. Thanks Imran !"
2018-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Travis,Great spot.
2018-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Monica,Michele's place is in a great little neighborhood and a super quick walk to King's Street for amazing food options! The place is so cozy and we couldn't have asked for a better stay/location.

2018-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,17223695,Martin,"The department of Anita is the best of Manly, I say it without knowing the others, but I assure you that it is impossible to find a better one. Location 10, comfort 10, cleaning 10 and hostess Anita 10. I think I was clear! Thank you very much Anita, I hope to return soon"

Very friendly and welcoming hosts. "
2018-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,22268452,Hannah,"Location of Shaun's place was amazing. I just had to walk a couple blocks away, catch the ferry, and go anywhere I liked. He recommended some good places to go and I love them all. Loved having the kitchen and all the necessary appliances needed to cook for myself, lovely cute place!"
2019-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Eileen,"I booked Sarah’s place very last minute and she responded immediately and let me know we could check in within the hour! Her place was spotless, the linens were great, and she supplied coffee and cream. We loved the location as it was central to everything but very quiet and peaceful. Sarah was helpful and kind.  We would definitely stay there again!!"

2017-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,1310308,Carry,"Het appartement ligt in een rustige straat en op loopafstand van zee en ferry naar the city Sydney. De voorzieningen zijn basic, geen extra comfort. Geen wifi. Het appartement is donkerder dan foto's suggereren. Prijs / kwaliteit verhouding niet in evenwicht. "
2017-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Jean-François,Very clean with all the amenities you need. Very nice shared bathroom. Had no difficulties finding the address. Although there was a little language barrier Shaung was very nice. I had no issues checking in to the room.

Unbeatable location close to great cafes, Sydney harbour and transport. Contained within a pretty nice older building too, and very quiet at all times of day/night. Recommend."
2018-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Alexander,Shuangs place is absolutely perfect for folks arriving and travelling from Sydney airport. wonderfully clean. Shuang responds very quickly to questions and issues. His dad is a delight and was very helpful when a thunderstorm knocked out the power. they made me feel very welcome in Sydney!

2017-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,18620288,Jutta,"Die Unterkunft liegt sehr zentral im angesagten Kirribilli, zu den Cafés 5-10 Minuten Fußweg, ebenso zur Harbour Bridge und der Bahnstation Milsons Point.
Zur Fähre 3 Minuten und dann in 10 Minuten zum circular quay.
Wir können die Wohnung nur empfehlen und werden sie bei unserem nächsten Sydney Aufenthalt bestimmt wieder buchen. Auch die Fotos im Internet entsprechen genau den Gegebenheiten."
2018-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,Nick,Awesome location. Nice and tidy.
2018-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,21648821,Sara And Espen,"As a family of 5 we have enjoyed the spacious and nice apartment. The parking lot at the garage and its location makes it very easy and convenient. 

There are also a variety of restaurants, supermarkets and playgrounds just walking distance.

Communicating with David was easy and would just suggest they have a closer eye on their outsourced cleaning and maintenance to be sure everything is cleaned and working prior to guests arrival."
2018-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Sara,"We had a great stay at Linda's place. Loved the location, perfect too as we were there for an event at Carriagworks which is a five minute walk away. Close to the train, good cafes/restaurants in the area. You can easily work to Redfern and Chippendale to explore the wider neighbourhood. Easy check in and quick response from Linda, helpful info booklet on the apartment and area.  Clean apartment, balconies, all details thought through with everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Quiet at night, I slept so well! Recommended and would definitely stay again"
2018-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,12655535,Phearnouk,"Ideal location, walking distance to most main attractions, very friendly neighbourhood and a beautiful and comfortable home."
2018-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,16166535,Philip,Fei and his wife were lovely and very accommodating people. The house and decor are beautiful and this was probably the best value-for-money place in Sydney I've come across. I'd highly recommend it.

2018-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,16654584,Stephen,"This place is amazing - in a great location.  Close to shops and buses which enable you to get into the city in around 20 minutes.  The ferry terminal is also close by.  

The accommodation is lovely and most importantly has a really comfortable bed with lovely pillows.  The wetroom was the highlight of the day which houses an amazing rainfall shower as well as attachments.  The hosts provide shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and gorgeous thick towels.  There was also an easy to use washing machine which again the liquid detergent is supplied.

The kitchen is small but very functional.  There is a fridge, microwave (which we didn't use), toaster, kettle and all the cutlery you will need.  Best of all there is a Nespresso machine and again pods are supplied but it might be a good idea to bring your own personal favorites.  

There is plenty of drawer and hanging space in the bedroom.  My only negative about this place is the smell of moth balls in the drawers and wardrobe.  There is also a safe in the wardrobe with an easy to remember code because it is the last 4 digits of your own phone number and this is also the case for the front door so no need to carry a key.

We would definitely stay here again as long as the hosts will have us back!"
2018-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,30056291,Lisa,"Nick & Ed were so warm welcoming & friendly. They helped me get settled in, recommended a good spot for dinner & left me alone. I slept peacefully & the location was perfect :)"

Beautiful Maroubra Beach is right across the street, saltwater pools are a 5 minute walk as are plenty of charming cafes. No need for a car, walk or use the bus that stops directly in front of the apartment.  Great for families & couples."
2018-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,23493822,Tony,"Very clean studio, Xiaowen met us outside to make sure we got in safely. Was small but perfect for our one night stay!"

Great shops, cafe, restaurants, bar, weekend flea markets, train station, etc., within 5mins from the house. The room is neat, tidy and lovely but expect to hear noises and footsteps from the upper floor if you book room downstairs."
2018-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,18047246,Gabriela,"We enjoyed our 5 night stay at Ven's very much.  He is a very friendly, easy going man and we would definetely stay with him again. Easy check in even though Ven was at work and our room had everything that was needed. We appreciated having the spacious bathroom and separate toilet for our use only.   
Thank you very very much for your hospitality Ven. :-))"

Victoria is great at maintaining communication and is very accommodating.  We had a super stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  Be sure to check out the local market at the square with the fountain if you are there on a Saturday.
2015-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,James,"The room was exactly as described and the self check-in process was super easy. The house is in a great location - Newtown has great restaurants, bars etc.

The neighborhood is fantastic to explore the city. You can do everything by foot, it's safe by night too.
Would definitely recommend this place to a friend."
2016-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Jamie,"We loved staying here!

2018-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Colleen,"This is the perfect location. Just a block from a great transit connection but walkable to the main sites too. 

It’s easy to get anywhere. We took the bus to Coogee and Bondi beaches, to Sydney Fish Market, to Opera House and ferry hub of Circular Quay for the ferry to Manly.  You are also on subway routes too!

The home is quiet even though the street and park are well used.  It feels super safe to walk in.

There are great grocery and restaurant options right here...and we were hooked on Greenhouse Coffee just a few blocks down to start our day. We enjoyed the Sydney Festival and walked to their events and free activities. 

The home had lots of lovely touches and thoughtful additions in the bath, the kitchen and a nice collection of books and info."

Will definitely recommend this place."

Thank you for your hospitality Yang & Edward."

The apartment is very conveniently located by Martin Place and provided us with a good base in Sydney for a few days.  The space is a reasonable size for inner city Sydney, and the king bed was a huge plus.  I would definitely stay here again in future."

2018-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Patricia,"Pamela and Hugo have an amazing apartment here. I was visiting for a conference at Sydney ICC and this was the perfect home base. It's walking distance to the conference center, opera house, botanical gardens. The large windows make the views incredible. Street noise was minimal and we slept very well in the comfortable bed."
2019-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,4872526,Elizabeth,Great place to stay for a weekend away on the northern beaches. The apartment was clean with modern amenities and a great view in a lovely location. Our host was very reliable to contact and we would definitely stay here again!

2017-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Abbey,We loved staying here! Perfect location + the flat was a great for a girls weekend away. The host Paul was very good with communication and there was lots of information about what to do in Sydney which was super helpful. The cleaner/host Wendy who checked us in was lovely & both her and Paul were wonderful about a later check in time due to a late flight. The flat itself is great. Thank you!

2014-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Andrea,"Great location! Gavin's place is right around the corner from the busiest public transportation station in Sydney. This made getting around easy and allowed us to take full advantage of the time we had. The room was very spacious and had all the essentials. 

Gavin was a great host! He made us feel at home at all times and even asked us to join him to some local sporting events. He gave us great tips on Sydney, and answered any other questions we had. 

Overall a great place to stay in Sydney! "
2015-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,1310308,Tom,This apartment was very nice to stay in. The pictures are all very accurate. The location of the apartment is very convenient being around a 10 minute walk away from multiple shops. I recommend this apartment to anyone wishing to stay in the Mosman area.
2017-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,19574869,Lee,A great little apartment in a fantastic location. Views from the deck are stunning and it is a lovely walk along the coast to either Bondi or Bronte beaches.
2018-06-27T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Christoph,"Judith and Paul are very nice hosts. They live in a beautiful old house in one of the hipper parts of the town with lots of nice little cafes and interesting shops just around the corner. We had a quiet room and a bathroom on our own.  
Public transport is perfect, three bus lines are operating nearby and also one station of the local trains is in walking distance. They even gave us a ""rechargeable"" ticket for the busses and boats which was very useful. Don't miss a ferry tour with the boats on the Sydney harbour. They operate between the different suburbs and start at Circular Quay, for example.  We can recommend Judith and Pauls house definetly for your visit in Sydney."
2017-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Anna,"Studio is located in the very heart of Sydney, can't get any better for exploring the city. It is small, but very well equipped. Swimming pool on the roof is a nice bonus too."
2016-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Judy,"Easy to find; lots of space; lovely, clean, near-new as described.  Perfect location for our night-before (too early!) domestic flight.  Very easy access to two train lines, so of Sydney close at-hand.  We'd stay there again!"
2017-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Angela,"We had a wonderful time staying with Kerri for almost three weeks.  She is a fantastic host and made us feel truly welcome in her lovely home.  We especially enjoyed the delicious fresh fruit salad prepared freshly every day to accompany breakfast.  The property is only a few minutes away from the train station, just 15 mins to the centre of the city, ideal for Sydney sightseeing.  Newtown, with its vibrant shops and estaurants is just a short walk away which was excellent for us as we became regular visitors to the Cow and Moon (voted best ice cream in the world).  We have no hesitation recommending Kerri and will definitely stay again when we next return to Australia."

2018-06-01T04:00:00.000Z,24460520,Michał,"Julia was a caring host. Altough we have not met in person she was available online, giving us hints and information about restaurants etc.
Place is just 5 minutes from metro station and eventhough its located close to bars & restaurants its calm and peaceful. Last but not least - the interior. Place is well designed - scandinavic minimalism (visible hygge concept influences) , a lot of space, nice lights, well equiped kitchen, new tv with (Hidden by Airbnb) chromecast so you can share your mobile screen on tv.  This is really a place you feel good in and cant wait to come back ;-)"
2017-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,18616850,Nisa,"Loved loved loved staying here. I booked the place for my (rather particular mother in law) and she said it was the first rental she didn’t have to go out and buy cleaning supplies and scrub head to toe. Our favorite - apart from the wonderful location - was the styling of the place, from the high quality linens to the choice of crockery and decor. Thanks!"

2019-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Salyna,Anita was at the apartment to greet us upon arrival with a very warm welcome. She has thought of every detail and has everything you need for your stay! The location is perfect! Easy transport from CBD to Bondi and right across the road from the apartment. The view across Bondi is amazing and very convenient for the coastal walks. The apartment is spotlessly clean and comfortable. Anita is helpful providing a tour of the building and also giving valuable hints and tip for great coffee and breakfasts. We loved our stay in Bondi and if back will definitely be staying at Anita’s again. Highly recommended.
2015-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,6228208,Martin,The host canceled this reservation 73 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

2018-08-04T04:00:00.000Z,24460964,梓锋,Awesome location. Cannot find any apartment convenient than this house in Airbnb. It is very suitable for tourists who come to Sydney first time.
2017-03-10T05:00:00.000Z,8106459,Paul,Brenda's place is well worth a stay. It is quirky and the art alone fascinating.We would recommend the accommodation without hesitation.
2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,5461928,Roberto,"We had a great stay at Stephanie's house.
A walking distance from cafes, groceries stores and other amenities came in very handy. The apartment is very well kept and very clean. It has a cozy flavour as well."
2017-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Mehdi,"We stayed 2night in Leslie's accommodation,it was a lovely place. Leslie was really friendly and we appreciated the accommodation and what a beautiful view."
2017-05-04T04:00:00.000Z,13299549,Marc,"Comfortable, nicely furnished apartment in secure building with an excellent location walkable to downtown Sydney attractions.  Check-in on the weekends is a little difficult as the property manager is not available and you have arrange to have someone pick up the keys ahead of time or pick them up from a lockbox in a completely different location.  During our stay, there was serious construction noise at night that started on the second night of our stay.  This was unexpected and anticipated to last two weeks.  Keris was kind enough to allow us to relocate to a hotel and refunded us for the unused nights which we greatly appreciated.  We were sad to have to end our stay early.  We would stay here again in the future if we have the opportunity.  "
2017-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Sara,Great location and such a cozy place! Paul is a very helpful host and responded all questions immediately. A note to people who would stay there on a Saturday night: be extra careful parking along the street as the place is very close to a popular bar and the Manly wharf. Someone used a marker (thank god not a permanent marker) to sign a signature on my white car and now I have to send the car to polish to be able to get that off completely. There is a public car park next to the place offering overnight parking.
2016-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Kim,"Very happy with the house, beautifully decorated and very spacious. Only issue was there was no wifi. "
2017-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Imogen,A great place if you're wanting to explore and make the most of Sydney's pubic transport - walking distance to supermarkets and cafes and super close to a main train station. A very welcoming space :)
2018-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Felicia,Angela's place is absolute luxury! We loved the provision of additional fruit and gourmet food! It's a really a nice touch and super handy when in a rush. I booked her place the day before my wedding - and it did not disappoint. Angela herself is very helpful and responsive. I would definitely stay here again for a holiday experience.
2018-10-04T04:00:00.000Z,20962081,Jenny,"非常好的房源,地段很好,去达令港步行十几分钟就到了,离海德公园和澳洲博物馆还有圣玛丽教堂都很近,机场过来不到二十分钟｡旁边有一个超大的Coles超市,也有亚洲超市,方便买菜做饭｡按摩椅很棒,超级舒服｡房东人很好,回复很及时｡"
2018-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Trisha,"This gorgeous studio is beautifully kept and the thought put into the set up and arrangement makes staying here a comfortable and relaxing experience. Close to everything and wonderfully quiet. A smaller space as a studio, yet it feels spacious and open. An uncluttered kitchen that has all the things you need. All the paradoxes. A joy to stay there. :)"
2017-06-26T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Marion,Great location and Anita provides a well accommodated apartment with the little extras that were appreciated.
2017-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Ruth,"Fantastic location. Within walking distance to many places of interest. Getting grocery was such an easy feat!Can save a lot on transport. We checked in late and Ana was very kind enough to accommodate my boy & me since I was my first time using Airbnb. Ana was very sweet and helpful in!!! That really makes us feel so welcome! I have read about other feedbacks about noises. As for me, I felt the noise level was not as loud as what others claimed. Since we were living right at the heart of the CBD, we do not expect total silence like living in a cave. We actually enjoyed the random sound of siren from ambulance, party-goers chiming to Christmas songs. It really represents a true heart of a city!
A big thumb up for the cleanliness of the places. Not a insect to be found! The air-con system was great! 
Discover that there is no shower curtain. Not sure if it is to deter people from taking long shower. Maybe having a simple one will be helpful to prevent unnecessary splashes. Just need to put a gentle note to remind to conserve water!
Thank you so much Jared for your prompt response and Ana for your great hospitality!"
2016-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Anthony,Rhonda's place was as described. It was clean and Rhonda was very helpful with information about the area. Rhonda travels around and uses Airbnb herself so knows how to make your stay comfortable.
2019-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,24858356,Jake,"Great little pad in a truly sensational location, very clean, has everything you need. It was smaller than expected, and it's on the ground floor which means the window looks out on to the main road. A little noisy at night (backpackers opposite) and you can hear the early risers rushing down to the beach, but it's not too bad. All in all very good!"
2015-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,7439246,Ian,"The main reason I chose Nathan's place was the kids bedroom. When we arrived and saw it, it exceeded our expectations indeed. For those that are traveling with kids, the kids room in this apartment is any child's dream wonderland which made settling our little girl in all that much easier. The location of the beach (just across the road) made it all the more fun. 

For a small apartment, I was very impressed with how Nathan has maximised the space. The apartment has obviously been updated with quality appliances. It was my first time using an induction stove top - it was most impressive. The heated master bed was also a great luxury.

Finally, it was all the little extras that Nathan provided that made it a memorable experience. We got a large box of chocolates, quality soap and well known brand name (eco and organic) hand wash and cleaning products.

Nathan kept in contact throughout the week and even recommended local places for us to check out which was very helpful for us. Check out was also very convenient for us which was great considering we were traveling with a child."
2018-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Robin,Very good value and great location. Very comfortable and spacious and great for 2 couples.
2018-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Jasmine,Stayed for one night due to proximity to airport. Clean. Easy check-in. Shower leaks a bit on floor. 7/11 close by with snacks.

Linda herself was very well organized and communicative during the stay. I'd definitely recommend it. I especially liked the box of TimTams she left out before my arrival :)"

2016-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,6201263,James,"The house was a perfect place to stay in Sydney. The rooms were all clean and tidy and cleaners came by regularly, the kitchen had everything we needed to cook up some good food (including fresh herbs outside). Robbie made us feel incredibly welcome - just make sure if you stay there you pester him to give you a guided meditation. Well worth it. If we are ever in need of a place to stay in Sydney we will be back. "

2017-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Patrick,"Couldn't recommend this place enough. From the moment we arrived Craige and Leonie were so kind and made us feel at home by showing us around and giving us guidance on where to visit and things to do. The house is amazing, clean and the garden is beautiful. It's a perfect spot as restaurants and bars are literally round the corner and bondi beach is only 5 mins walk. Even though it is so close to the nightlife it's on a quiet road so getting a good nights sleep was easy. We had Xmas dinner with their family which was incredible generous. You have to do the walk from bondi beach along the coast to Coogee as it's stunning!! 

Overall couldn't fault anything about our stay and if we ever need somewhere to stay near bondi in future I will be coming straight back here. 

Thanks again for an amazing few days. 

Patrick and Elle x"
2015-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,5482864,Sonia & Ricardo,"This place is as beautiful as it looks in the pictures. It is clean, tidy, well-decorated and makes you feel like home. The living room is nice and bright in the day and if you need a break from drinking in the bars and pubs at night (which are within walking distance by the way), the balcony is a nice place to relax too. Lucile has been super helpful and friendly in providing us with all the necessary details required for our stay. If there is one thing you need to know about this place, it is that the beds are really comfy! It's like sleeping in your favorite clean, old t-shirt. Be careful, you might find it hard to peel yourselves off the bed in the mornings. Thank you once again for sharing your beautiful home with us!"

2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,20962081,Jason,Good apartment and location but the building has a no airbnb policy so there is a chance of being kicked out if caught which is unsettling

Get your Opal Card and take a Ferry over to the Opera House and take in the amazing sight of the Harbor Bridge . Wynyard Station is within walking distance . Take the train up to Katoomba and spend the day at the Blue Mountains . 
After a long day of sightseeing make your way back to the apartment for a quite evening on the Balcony where you can relax and take in the city views of Sydney ."
2016-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Verena,"The house is located in a great neighborhood with lots of places to eat around and just a short train ride from the touristic center. Kitchen and bathrooms were nice and spacious. The room looked just like in the photos, really nice and big enough for two suitcases and stuff. The window faces the street so it might be a bit too noisy  if u're very sensitive to that. MissD was very helpful with our questions although we never met her. The cleanliness of the bathrooms depends a lot on the other guests too. For us it could have been a bit better, but was ok. Value for money is great!"

Having checked in quickly, then left, it was really nice to come back later to a well lit cabin with the heater on. 
A quick walk to a bus stop - and the Light Rail is within walking distance as well. "

The apartment is right next to the 333 bus stops on Campbell Parade and one minute from the beach, Bondi icebergs and the Bondi to Bronte Coastal walk. And It has a great view of the beach!

Terry was there at the airport to pick us up and on our way she even gave a quick orientation of nearest train station, restaurants and convenience stores that helped us a lot throughout our stay. The room and bath room were very neat and clean. They had even kept basic toiletaries. We were free to use the kitchen and walk into the house at anytime. Bus stops and train stations are walking distance which is a big plus point. And, not to forget the beautiful view from their house that Yiu cab wake up to. I would rate 5/5 in all aspects. Highly recommended "
2018-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,20962081,Mary,Great location.
2015-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Rory,"Susan and Gregg are the perfect hosts, not only with their warm welcome and lovely local bread, yoghurt and fruit, but their considered expert knowledge both locally and the wider Sydney area. Their studio matched the expectation and was snug, private, quiet and well presented, we liked it so much we stayed twice! Bronte is a perfect location for stunning coastal walks, funky eats(3 blue ducks and the Pavilion mm!) and easy bus and train, best of all is Susan and Gregg as hosts!"
2014-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Emily,Naveen and Triston were awesome hosts! They're place is in a great location in Darlinghurst with many things to explore. We had great time hanging out with them and thoroughly enjoyed their home.
2016-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,4164487,Matus,"Our stay in Sydney was fabulous. Not only because the city itself is fantastic, also because Duncan and Ashlee were most helpful whenever needed. Room is very pleasant with comfy bed. Always very clean and tidy. 10-12 minutes bus ride to city centre. Its a shame though that we didn't have  more time to chat together, because these guys are really easygoing. Highly recommended to stay here. "
2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,26474245,Adam,"Unbelievable facilities, location and cleanliness. Leigh is unbelievably organised, professional and punctual. Highly recommend"
2018-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,19376053,Lisanne,"An appartement at a perfect location, really beautiful and good communication with the owner. I highly recommend it."
2017-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Amir,"Angela was a great Host, very friendly and kind. It was the first time we used Airbnb and we had a problem with the booking but Angela called Airbnb for us and helped to solve our problem within 5 minutes. Thanks for that again :). The room was clean as shown on the pictures. My girlfriend and me stayed 3 nights. Reaching the beach just takes 2 minutes by foot.  "
2018-07-29T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Ryan,"Everything as described, but nothing more. Paid a fair bit for this, so was a tad disappointed to see no effort is made beyond the bare minimum - no info/handbook or anything. I did appreciate the easy check-in and not having to meet, makes things alot quicker and easier."
2016-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Heather,Fantastic location to explore Sydney... thanks Naveen for all your recommendations and making us feel welcome. Loved being so close to the sauna!. Cheers Heather
2018-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,24863216,Ellen,Small but very stylish and clean. Great for one person or a couple. 15 min walk to the beach and off street parking available 100-200m away (free and untimed).
2016-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Sam,Great people felt like I had known them for years
2015-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,8277472,Matthew,Many good things can be said about the room and atmosphere Elizabeth and Simon provide. They are down to earth people and gladly help you in anyway they can. Everything was clean and the bed was comfy. The location is great for sightseeing with light rail and buses close by.
2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Ami,"This apartment (in a hotel) is in a great location in the heart of Sydney's main attractions and easily accessible by public transport. Grocery store, shops, Sydney Harbor, etc were all within very short walking distance as described. 

The apartment itself is spacious and clean. Makes for a good base to prep breakfast and do laundry. Beds were comfy.  As mentioned in the description there is ongoing light rail work but w/ windows closed the noise isn't bad. 

Finally the host was responsive to messages and check in was smooth."
2017-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,15060713,Jennifer,Andrei’s place is a comfortable unit close to the sights of Sydney. I would definitely stay here again.
2019-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,17944310,Khalida,Great place to stay specially if you want a quiet and serene location. Though a few stairs can hinder an easy access.
2017-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,16635022,Gooser,"This is the BEST HOST ever!! So sweet and nice! Thanks for taking caring of us, me and my family really enjoy our staying^^ Thank you so much!! You guys gonna love this city as well^^
Sincerely from Abess"
2016-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Sialo,"We did not feel welcome, we lost our way not Narelle's fault but her response when we called her was a put off.  The raising of voice as she questioned how we could loose our way was  unpleasant and unnecessary"
2018-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,9597872,Glen,It was a good location with friendly locals and good bars
2017-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,20767798,Danii,"Great stay! Spacious unit for Sydney CBD. Perfect location for circular quay, Pitt st mall, train stations, the rocks, all just 5min walks away. Thanks Jared will definitely recommend your property to others."
2019-01-30T05:00:00.000Z,24460964,Patrick,"What a great downtown Airbnb! 5 star unit and amazing communication with the host. Easy to get to get to and the area is a blast too, would definitely recommend"

2016-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,4164487,C,"Highly recommended.  Duncan and Ashlee are great and very accomodating.  The place is neat, quiet, and perfect and is just one bus stop away from the city.  The neighborhood feels safe as well.  Would love to be back in their place someday."
2017-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Ariel,Linda was a very helpful hostess to us! She prepared everything we needed. We enjoyed cooking every morning.
2015-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Ashleigh,This was a great stay! The place exceeded my expectations and is definitely better then the pictures. Belinda and Chris were very friendly. The location is right by the water and there are so many great walking tracks nearby. I would definitely stay again
2016-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Oliver,"Craige was accommodating from the moment we arrived late and he stayed up to give us the tour to the very end of our stay. Super helpful with advice for us regarding local attractions and the easiest way to get from A to B. The actual property itself was stunning and brilliantly placed, literally a few mins from Bondi Beach. Couldn't recommend this highly enough. "
2019-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,23636182,Jackie,"Good location, nice view. Excellent!"
2016-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Aaron,"Great location, roomy apartment and decent amenities. Disappointing that the apartment wasn't clean - bed linen was clean, but the carpets and tops of surfaces weren't clean (dead bugs, crumbs, hair, fluff, threads etc) and there are a few maintenance items that need to be addressed. 
Overall, once I cleaned the apartment myself, we had a great stay and the price was very reasonable. "
2017-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,18082902,Louise,"Cedric went above and beyond to make sure I had a great stay. He was amazing to communicate with and I felt very comfortable and at home from the moment I arrived. The place was clean, spacious and in a fantastic area I would definitely recommend this place. "
2017-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,1143151,Kelly,We loved our stay at Eleanor’s place! The apartment is cosy and clean. A home away from home! The location is amazing! Next time we are in sydney we will be staying here again.
2018-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Dane,We had a very brief stay and the apartment was literally across the road from Central Station. Our booking was very last minute and Alexey's responses were very prompt - very good communication. The one negative was the noise from the station which was quite noticeable from the bedroom.
2018-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Yzella,"Millie’s apartment is perfect for a solo traveller like myself, or for a couple. The location is perfect, only a short train ride right into circular quay! The view from the balcony  overlooking harbour bridge while I ate my breakfast was something else! 
Millie responded to my messages super quickly and answered all my questions. 
Definitely recommend staying here and if I ever get the chance to go back to Sydney this is where I’d hope to stay!"
2018-07-14T04:00:00.000Z,22308786,Sarah,"This apartment is a in a great location and is almost new. The furniture was modern and nice, bed comfortable. Very quite in the bedrooms. However, we had a number of maintenance issues that were clearly there prior to our arrival and left unfixed. This was disappointing and seemed careless. For example the toilet seat in the ensuite was broken and not stable to sit on, the ensuite door handle had been snapped off so if the door closed could not be opened from the bedroom, there was a broken drying rack that had been dumped on the patio, the towel rail in the main bathroom was broken off and there was no where to hang towels, the coffee machine was broken and the heating system on the top floor emitted a really bad smell. I guess there was a dead mouse or rat in the system or roof. "
2018-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Navid,Perfect
2014-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Robin,"DJ was a very nice host.

The room and the bed are very comfortable. You get your own bathroom which is a very nice plus. The apartment is very well located, well connected in terms of public transportation. Recommended."
2017-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Neil,Jeremy was easy to communicate with and his place was really great!
2018-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,24460520,先生,"The house was very private and well equipped, and we had an unforgettable evening."
2017-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Alex,The property is a great place to base yourself in central Sydney. There are 4 double beds and 2 bathrooms. Jeremy was a great host and was very easy to communicate with.
2018-09-08T04:00:00.000Z,22268452,Jia Jia,"Shaun is an amazing host! He pretty much makes me feel like in a home. I can wander around and use many facilities in the house. Also Shaun responded text or in person very quick and kind. The room is big and clean. but the whole house's too cold to me. One thing I'd like to suggest to Shaun is that ""the hot water only running 8 mins"" should be info on the house profile, so people can consider if this condition fits them."
2018-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,9701620,Yvette,"A great place with great hosts, easy walk to everything and so close to the light rail and buses. Quiet at night for a great sleep and space for everyone to chill. Lots of places an easy walk to eat, really was the perfect spot for us to have our holiday . Definitely planning to stay here again."
2017-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,9802077,Martin,Lovely stay and very nice apartment. Helena was a great host
2018-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Bảo Hoàng,"Sam’s apartment is a tidy and comfortable place which is just a few steps from the shopping centers and other landmarks. 2 queen beds and a mattress are ample for 6 (or more) persons. Whatever you expect about a nice and affordable place to stay in the middle of crowded Sydney, you can find it here. The hosts were very friendly and helpful as well. Definitely would come again in the future."
2018-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Elvira,"Great location, near to the beach and restaurants. Craige & Leonie are friendly and relaxed. After checkout we may use facilities., very kindful. Spitefully the house wasn’t clean, a lot of dust in the sleepingroom,  and the bathroom was’t clean either."
2018-03-07T05:00:00.000Z,20962081,Feng,Min很好 房子地角很好 很便利
2019-01-24T05:00:00.000Z,17028088,Jim,"Kathy's place was perfect, a minutes walk to the beautiful Centennial Park and great amenities. Perfect if you have a car and want it as a base to explore Sydney and its surrounds."
2018-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,25684995,Candice,"Nice spot at a great location. Supermarket and 24h food kiosks just round the corner, and the train station is just minutes away on foot. However, might not be suitable for younger travellers as it is within the red light district of Sydney with plenty of strip clubs around. That said, it is a safe gated building which never left us any worries."
2018-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,26934151,Vicki,Perfect location!  Close to the train station so it was very easy to get anywhere.  The neighborhood was full of great restaurants or if you want to stay “home” there are grocery stores close by.  The kitchen had everything you needed to cook.  We loved hanging out on the balcony to unwind and relax after full days of exploring.  Beautiful place!!!
2018-03-12T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Sue,"Pamela and Hugo's apartment has a fantastic location, right next to Hyde Park, close to stations Town Hall and Museum, near the supermarket, shops and restaurants. It is comfortably furnished, has a comfy bed and great TV. The kitchen, although functional, could possibly be updated to modern standards I think. But it has fantastic views over Hyde Park and part of Sydney Harbour."
2019-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,17438054,Jaq,"Wonderful stay at George and Lucia’s lovely home.
Lovely private setting and sparkling clean and with everything we could ever need for our short stay.
George’s recommendation for dinner was also a real highlight to our stay.
Thank you"
2018-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,16070079,Nicholas,"Gregoire's place is just amazing and well-located near the train station! Just minutes away from all the bustling City! The atmosphere back at home is surreal, it's a perfect airbnb house to go for!"
2018-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,27735420,Vera,"住这里非常舒服,干净,东西齐全｡就像自己家一样,非常满意｡周边交通便利,购物便利,下次来悉尼依然会首选Francoise的家"
2018-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Kevin,Great place close to Nepean Hospital.  Worked out really well for a 6 week stay. Host is very friendly and helpful. Has everything you need for short or longer stay.
2015-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,Michel,"Good apartment. If you've got kid(s) be aware that there is no door for the bedroom. At all. Also if you come in a car, the parking outside is 1P or 4P and incredibly expensive, up to $17 per hour. You can find free parking about 10-15 minute walk away. Bondi waves always work so if that's your thing this place is worth the steep price"
2017-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Yiseul,nice view!
2017-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Finola,"The garden studio gave us the escape we needed for our first anniversary getaway. Offering self contained comfort with calm, beautiful beaches and shops/cafes a stroll away and nearby the Coastal Walk with its dramatic cliff edges and seascapes, it would be challenging to find a more well situated spot. Highly recommended for a few days away. "
2017-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,10091713,Angela,"很小巧精致的房间,独立的厨房卫生间,各项设备齐全,居住十分方便｡位置也十分便利,能观望到悉尼大桥和海湾景色｡美中不足的是入住第一晚隔壁房子在举办彻夜的party及高声唱歌,相当打扰睡眠"
2015-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Rohan,"Susan and Greg were brilliant hosts having thought of everything beyond just a comfortable stay for the three of us. There was Greg ready with maps and things to do, places to eat, Cricket kit for my 7 yr old boy and easy to remember wifi password. Susan had a mini botanic tour for us at her pretty garden early morning. And to top it all they even helped us pack!
Best hosts ever..."
2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Jacinta,Fantastic beautiful relaxing place to stay. Perfect hosts. Great location. Will stay again.
2017-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,18338274,Yang,Very nice house and Bill is very thoughtful.
2017-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Abby,"This is a wonderful modern apartment which has all the modern conveniences that one could hope for. Great for a couple with one bedroom . There is a provision to convert the sofa into a sofa bed as well. The apartment is in a secure building and also has a parking space in the basement.
But this icing on the cake is the wonderful responsiveness of the host Yang. Very accomodating and quick in responses. Highly recommended. "
2017-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,16234640,Alexander,"Great place.
Yang and her husband are lovely and efficient hosts who provided helpful tips/maps/etc for us.
The apartment itself was clean and modern, walking distance to the ferry, IGA, and some cafes, and a 10 minute drive from spotless stadium.
Thanks a bunch for everything!"
2016-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,12370710,Alexa,First experience in Manly with Maria is really wonderful. The room is so spacious and bright just as displayed in the album. We enjoy the sunrise and breakfast on that colourful balcony very much. Maria and her husband are warm sunshine in chilly windy Sydney. We really appreciate their hospitality and kindness. Looking forward to our next visit to that shiny sea and this cute accommodation.

2017-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Anita,Een heel bijzonder huis om in te verblijven in een superieure buurt in Sydney. Prima uitvalsbasis voor een bezoek aan de stad.
2018-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,27590773,Brian,If you stay in this apartment and feel that it is not up to the standard you are expecting then you are the type of person who expects to buy a Rolls Royce for BMW money.
2017-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,恵子,"空港へのｱｸｾｽも良く､期待以上に良かったです｡お風呂やﾄｲﾚなどすべて清潔で､おもてなしの精神を感じました｡
ただ､となりの部屋が近いのであまり騒げません"
2018-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Jacob,"Evelyn and Andy are the most warm-hearted and helpful hosts we ever had. The place is truly worth the label ""AirBNB plus"" as it has everything one could dream: spacious and light filled living room, comfortable bed and bathroom, amazing views, pool and sauna... We enjoyed our stay to the fullest!"
2015-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Fenella,"Lovely apartment in very central location, perfect for easy access to trains and buses and within walking distance of the City and Circular Quay. Bright, compact and comfortable - a very enjoyable stay. Many thanks Hugo."
2013-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,888107,Vivian,"We had a really good time at Wyatt's house. We loved the area, cause it was possible to walk into the city and Annandale has several nice cafés and shops and it was not too busy. We enjoyed ourselves during a breakfast on the little balcony. Wyatt's place is furnitured with a lot of love and good taste. He always was there if we had any questions about the city. The only little thing we could criticise is that the bed in the smaller room is like a sleeping couch which was not the most comfy sleep. But it was ok for us. We had a great time at his place and would recommend it!"
2018-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,2711936,Angelique,"Had a chance to stay with Karen over the weekends and I'm glad I have chosen her place. It's very near to everything especially to the beach. Place is very cozy and nice. Karen is a super host! She is very hospitable and kind. She even gave me a tour and recommended the best spots to visit in Bondi, and on my last day I was a bit in a hurry to get back to the city and she offered me a ride to the bondi junction."
2017-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Jill,Victoria's place was the perfect location for our holiday. Vickie was there to meet us upon check-in and shared some priceless tips with us. We had a great time!
2017-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,1979960,Melissa,"Great location. Only issue we had was due to no air conditioning and no fly-screens there were bugs everywhere as it was hot when we stayed. The downstairs shower is a hassle as water goes all over the bathroom floor after each shower as there is only a shower curtain around it. Other then that the house was clean and in a very nice, quiet neighborhood and Jeremy made organizing the trip and our stay incredibly easy. "
2018-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Victoria,The place was absolutely amazing and in the perfect location! Communication was so easy and the little touches like the bottle of wine made it extra special. Honestly could not have booked a better place for our time in Sydney!
2017-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,16261574,Trent,"Perfect location for events at Sydney Olympic Park, very close. Lovely apartment with great facilities. Jennifer was very helpful and easy to communicate with. Would definitely stay here again."

2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,19990097,Sherene,"I can only say George is a 5 stars host that I ever met before! A traveler like me, I traveled very often in a year, Airbnb always the best option for me to book for my stay. I traveled 8 countries last year and this year I had been 4 countries up to date! So far non of the host provided such a great service like George. He wrote me daily train schedule, remind me of the road block, changes of the train schedule and even he planned for my itinerary on the daily basic. 

There was this night when we faced a small issue at home! I text him to ask for help! Without asking much, George appeared in the home and help us solve our problems. 

When we running out of idea of places to go. Again he visited us at 10pm plus to discuss with us of his friend (travel agent) day tour packages for us! 

George always very thoughtful towards our stay! He even offered to send our luggages to the train station when we left the place! 

All 13 of us rated his place 5 stars not only for our stay but also because of his warm hospitality! I will definitely recommend all my friends to choose him! Great location, comfortable house,  thoughtful host with very affordable rental!"
2018-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Emily,"I had a wonderful stay here for two nights. The place was exactly as it looks in the photos - very modern, clean and comfortable, and is an easy walking distance from Central Station and Surry Hills bars, restaurants and coffee shops."
2018-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,16549021,Michael,Excellent 3 bedroom townhouse with plenty of room and having 3 showers to access was great. location was perfect with very short drive or walks to everything you need in Cronulla
2015-03-12T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Steph,"I stayed at Hernan's place only one night, but the experience was very nice.  Everything was exactly as described and as told.  The place is conveniently close to the airport and pleasantly close to a lovely beach.  Hernan is a very nice guy, and made me feel at home right away.  He helped me out with my logistics without hesitation.  I would stay there again."

2013-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Jacky,"This studio out the back of caths house was a pleasure to stay in. The clever design makes use of a small space and the decore was stylish. Cath treated us with her homemade treats which were a real welcomed surprise.
We enjoyed looking out onto her veggie patch, the morning sun lit upnthe big photo of clouds on the wall and was lovely to wake to every morning.
Highly recommended."

2014-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Trav,We were looking for a place to stay for my mums birthday weekend. Scrolling through AIRBNB and we found this place. All I can say is amazing. Great mackerel has everything you could want and more. The house and tree house is amazing. The kitchen is perfect and the view is unbelievable. Photos definitely don't do the house justice. Strongly recommend. The hosts are contactable and super pleasant. Easy to deal with and very accommodating. We will be aiming to stay again soon.
2015-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,7718248,Tim,Sharon has a lovely home. It's centrally located with buses nearby. Her home is very well presented and clean with plenty of bedrooms and room to move. As a host she went out of her way to ensure we had everything we needed and was very responsive to any questions (even though she was overseas!). We had a great time and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.
2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,6785160,Meg,"Easy place to stay, good transport. Very clean with Friendly people. Proximity to The flight path was a bit of an issue for me but might not be for others."
2019-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,16813942,Micaela,Absolutely loved our stay at Cheryl’s. The location is amazing and the house is very cosy. We were 5 people staying which was a bit much for this house as the extra bed was more of a day bed. I would absolutely recommend staying here if you’re 4 people or less though. I’m sure I’ll be back!
2018-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Alistair,Susan and Greg were perfect hosts. Their studio is beautifully furnished and had everything we needed for a long weekend getaway. We would love to come stay again!
2017-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Fay,"Lovely, tastefully designed and very clean apartment in a great location. We had high expectations having read the rave reviews and it certainly did not disappoint. "
2014-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Jolien,Gavin is a great host. He gave us great ideas (places to see). We enjoyed our stay very much. The location is great; lots of busses and trains within walking distance.
2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,16160263,Helen,"Justine was a great host, her apartment felt very secluded and private although it was only 10 minute walk down to avalon beach and shops. She was very hospitable and had some nice touches she had prepared for us!"
2016-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Nichole,"Spacious beautiful Australian home. Its location couldn't have been any better; the beach, bus stop, and grocery store were only a short walk away. Cat was very accommodating, had a well kept home, and fast internet. Our only regret was that we couldn't stay longer. "
2016-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,14223095,Raelene,"Very pleasant location, spacious apartment, extremely clean bathroom and kitchen. Excellent WiFi reception. Very friendly and helpful host"

Nice new apartment, good location and great service!

Thanks Yang"

2017-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Carol,Great location for exploring Sydney. Good value. Mariana is a great host and the little touches made a big difference. The block is a bit noisy so ear plugs are useful! Very comfortable apartment.
2015-11-05T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Alessio,"Susan was very friendly and helpful to give us a lot of information. 
Location is good for the public transportation (we used a lot) but very noisy due to the plans! "
2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,10416859,Chunqin,"Nice living, had everything in the apartment "
2016-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Leah,Really nice apartment - everything was clean & comfortable!
2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,20962081,Catherine,"Great location, right across World Square with Coles Supermarket at the basement. Close walking distance to Darling Harbour, Sydney Tower Eye, Hyde Park and BigBus station. There was 1 night where both lifts are out of service, couldn't get down for dinner, luckily we have some food in the apartment which was meant for next day breakfast. Overall, we enjoyed the stay, massage chair is plus point at the end of the day after more than 15,000 walking steps."
2017-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,1944996,Matt And Lou,"Great location, accessible to Surry Hills and the CBD. Excellent for work or play.  Annie's home is what Airbnb is all about. Thank you!"
2015-05-04T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Brocherie,Gavin's place is near central. It is a perfect situation. His apartment is huge and we had a good bedroom.
2016-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,1321603,Cath,"Gorgeous little treasure Dangar is! Ann is generous in sharing her little paradise, her amazing knowledge and stories. We will be back. "
2016-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,6170899,Megan,"Jennifer's Balmain house is an absolute delight. A lovingly decorated and comfortable house in a quiet street. Our family had a most enjoyable stay - breakfast in the tree-filled  courtyard, nicely appointed bedrooms with quality linen. We enjoyed spending time in Balmain and imagining how nice it would be to live there.   "
2019-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,20906161,Kyla,"Quirky artsy apartment in amazing location. 

Alexey was super helpful and responsive and would definitely recommend staying with him if you’re heading to Sydney :D"
2018-09-13T04:00:00.000Z,19376053,Amber,Great place near the trains! Would stay again
2016-04-17T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Debra,"Friendly helpful host nothing too much trouble.  The cabin was lovely, nicely decorated and in a nice quiet area.  The beach across the road was great to be able to go for a walk."
2018-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,23493822,Christine,"Xiaowen's accommodation offers a clean, modern bedroom & adjoining private bathroom. The room size is on the small side, however, there is excellent storage and the quality of the amenity is very good. The bed is really comfy; the complimentary bath products are of good quality; the privacy of the room is excellent and access is easy; and the neighbourhood is very quiet for relaxing, undisturbed sleeping at night. We used this accommodation as a base when visiting family & friends (so we were out most of the day & into the evening) and it served us very well in that context. Good value for money."
2019-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,27716426,Ying,Beautiful and cozy place. Cafes and restaurants are just nearby. Great place to stay:)
2017-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Lisi,"Great location in the city, lots of space for everybody& plenty of bathrooms to make your stay easy. Fantastic inner city views. Very clean & comfy beds."
2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,Simon,"Loved the location and the spacious property.  Easy to get around with ferry close by.  Many restaurants, cafes and supermarket for essentials, all very close.  The beach is literally short stroll away.  Well appointed and tastefully furnished.  We loved our week's stay and would stay again if opportunity arose.  The hosts were also very welcoming and most importantly very responsive."
2017-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Lee,"Love the house it's really decorated nicely with thoughts. Kitchen utensils were equipped would be better to add a bigger pot for large consumptions. We asked for later check out and the host was able to help. Found a dirty underwear in one of the room lol but that's alright.  Overall a pleasant stay easy access to shop for food and drinks and crossing the harbour. The neighbourhood is really beautiful, enjoyed the walk to wharf everyday. "
2016-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,7920463,Claire,"Lovely, very genuine and welcoming people. Clean room with comfortable bed and very convenient location. I am definitely planning on going back!"
2016-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Rebecca,"This was the perfect place for my friend and I for our first trip to Sydney! The place looks exactly like the pictures and was as clean as a hotel room when we arrived! Angela was very accommodating and even provided some basic foodstuffs for us in the fridge when we arrived. 

You could not ask for a better location staying here. It's only a few blocks to Darling Harbour and a short walk to The Rocks and Circular Quay. It was easily accessible and we had no issues throughout our time staying there. I highly recommend this studio and would definitely stay here again!

"
2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Anna,"Belinda was a great host. The place is very clean and location is beautiful, peaceful and very convenient."
2018-06-08T04:00:00.000Z,20767798,Louise,This is incredibly well positioned and close to everything! Little bit of noise from construction but that can’t be helped. Clean place and well appointed.
2018-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Dorothy,"Paul and Judith are lovely people and wonderful hosts. I stayed for a month and they were very kind and helpful and we became good friends. The house is in a great location being near useful bus routes, supermarkets and restaurants. The accommodation is excellent value for money. I would recommend it for any length of stay. Be aware that the bathroom is on the floor below. The room is large  with a bed, reading lights,lots of cupboards and a hanging rail. .The park outside is lovely but occasionally you can get people talking there late into the night, so make sure you have earplugs."
2018-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,21568012,Liam,David’s place was very good
2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,22124796,Nolan,Gorgeous place and amazing host!
2018-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Sarah,Lovely little house in a quiet suburb. The house looks directly into their own home which I did not realise when booking. Apartment is small but enough for a 1 night stay.
2015-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Quan,"Simon and Nicole were very helpful throughout our stay. They were on hand to help at all times and addressed our needs without any issues.The apartment was as described, nicely renovated and maintained in a nice, quiet, easy to access building. It had everything we needed and more. Surry Hills is a great area close to all attractions in the city but away from the noise and hustle, cafes and restaurants are a short walking distance making it an area ideal for all purposes."
2018-03-29T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Mark,Nice quiet relaxing home
2017-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Mariane,"Great cozy cottage stay! The studio is within a garden which gives a great leafy outlook. Belinda was a very welcoming host. We took her recommendations and went on a beautiful coastal walk- within the Royal National Park. The studio is also walking distance from the beach and the Cronulla ferry.
All in all it was a great get-away!"
2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Heena,"From the warmest of welcomes and first moment you enter Angela & Geoff’s home, you instantly realise that you are about experience a very unique property and enjoy all the creature comforts that make their home feel as if it is yours. 

Each element of how the property caters for you is well thought out beyond your expectations, notwithstanding how serene its surrounds are and proximity it is to town, beach and coastal views. A return visit is already on the cards!"
2016-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,6170899,Margaret,Jennifer was there to meet us and was very helpful . I loved staying at her house .
2017-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,16166535,Kiri,Amazing decor
2017-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Emily,Craige & Leonies place was great - super close to shops and bars and of course the beach! They were great at responding and check in and out was so easy! We had booked thinking we had a whole apartment rather than just one room in a house - but we still had plenty of privacy. Thanks again!
2017-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,5993432,Mar,"A cozy space situated in the heart of the city, the apartment was a great place to stay in. The apartment was well set up for my four day stay, reasonably quiet, and was close enough to restaurants and public transport."
2017-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,15745971,Ines,"Mohit ist ein sehr netter Gastgeber, allerdings kamen Antworten auf Fragen zumeist mit einiger Verzögerung. Die Wohnung ist schön gelegen, zwischen Flughafen und Zentrum, so dass beide gut erreichbar waren. Die Wohnung selbst bietet viel Platz, erstreckt sich über 2 Etagen und ist schön und praktisch eingerichtet, mit eigenem Parkplatz. Leider waren die Bäder nicht top sauber. Dennoch empfehlenswert."
2014-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,2900140,Lorna,"Anne was extremely generous and helpful, and a wonderful host.  The apartment is lovely, light and bright with everything I needed, and more, such as a very comfortable bed and a great shower.  Lots of morning sunshine and night-time ocean waves - my favourite go-to-sleep sound!  And exactly as the description says, it's just a few minutes easy stroll to the beach which is fabulous, even in the middle of winter.  The neighbourhood was peaceful with cafes and shops only 5 minutes away.  I absolutely loved my time at Neiafu and Newport, and can't wait to return.  Thank you so much Anne. "
2018-05-21T04:00:00.000Z,19641701,Björn,The apartment was very nice with an amazing view over north Sydney and the Harbour bridge. The apartment is perfect for 3 or 4 people and has everything you need.
2018-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Chris,Perfect spot for a getaway. Wouldn't stay elsewhere in Bundeena.
2014-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Kim,We booked Jeremy's lovely property as an offsite location for a work project. Jeremy was very friendly and professional and also extremely responsive - he replied to all of my messages immediately. This place has a lot of character and is in a great location for anybody visiting Sydney for the first time. Thanks again Jeremy!
2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Bob,"Unbelievable location.  Only one block from Hyde Park and close to all public transportation.  The house was modern, clean, and had plenty of space for all six of us.  We really appreciated that each bedroom had their own bathroom."
2016-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Judith,"There are no words to describe how perfect this property was for our needs and for how amazing Heidi was in accommodating our request. Heidi bent over backwards to make the property available to us even though it meant she and her family had to change their plans to vacate the property. 

The location and size of the house plus all the extras were a perfect fit for us. We needed a place where family could come together - from Spain, Bangladesh, Melbourne, Albury, Gundaroo and Canberra - for a funeral and Heidi's place was like coming home. 

On the one night when everyone was staying over, the house easily slept 9 adults and 3 children. It was great having access to 3 bathrooms. Off road parking and great relaxing options both inside and outside. The pool and spa and trampoline and cubby house were the icing on the cake. 

Thank you a million times over for your generosity Heidi - it made a world of difference to all of us. 

"
2017-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,16549021,Jonathan,"Would highly recommend, Rob and his place were both Great!"
2018-07-05T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Liew,Very spacious apartment with a huge TV in the living room and v comfortable beds :)
2014-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,1145567,Ramon,"Alison immediately replied to my booking request and organised for her hubby to meet me as I was checking in late.

They were very helpful and gave me a bus card to use. The room was very spacious and the house was close to transport and restaurants.

Excellent hosts in an excellent location.

 "
2016-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,1310308,Caroline,"The apartment was lovely, comfortable and quiet. 5 min walk to Mosman village where all the shops/cafes/restaurants are. Beautiful Balmoral is only a 15-20 min walk (5 min drive) and the Sydney CBD is easily accessible by ferry or bus. Communications with Mags was really easy. "
2016-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,13299549,Roni,"This place was in an awesome location and looks just like the pictures!  the kitchen was well equipped and it was great having a washer/dryer too.
We felt very safe there and were within walking distance to everything!
our host made us feel very welcome and we would recommend this to other travelers for sure!"
2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,21648821,Dipika,"The location of the property was perfect, close to everything and nice quiet area. There is no air-conditioning system in the house, and the host provided fans but that did not do the job as the house got really hot and we all struggled to sleep at night. The 2 occasional chairs in the living room was an interesting design and slants to the front so was very uncomfortable - we were 6 adults and the living room furniture couldn't accommodate was all comfortably. "
2018-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,23636182,Pamela,"To future customers you can expect clean towels ready to use, basic toiletries provided, laundry machine and dryer, cutlery, dishwasher and utensils. The hosts are very friendly and attentive to your needs."
2016-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Clo,Susan was nice and explain the vehicle network in very detail. Although we have not much communication but i can feel Susan is willing to talk. I may visit back to Susan place when i visit Sydney next time.
2017-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Zoe & James,"Impressive old home in a great location. The design of the bathroom, view of the pool and massive art collection was a bit of a luxury for us. The eclectic space made us feel at home."
2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,2838442,Matt,A great cheap stay for one
2017-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Emily,"房東很親切. 地點方便, 鄰近有很多小商店及餐廳, 近火車站"
2014-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Mimi,"I have stayed at a lot of Airbnbs over the past year or so, and Naveen's place was definitely the most special. The apartment itself was lovely, modern, great décor, awesome building w/ a pool and gym, etc. The location is also superb, super easy to get to the CBD and plenty of bars and restaurants and shopping close by. Most importantly, Naveen and Tristan are just the loveliest hosts, so gracious and inclusive, and I genuinely felt welcome in their home. Their puppy is really cute too :)"
2018-07-01T04:00:00.000Z,21851474,Kain,"great, stylish little place to wake up in. quiet yet central location in Sydney. :)"
2018-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,23493822,Cai,there's more place for improvement
2018-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,23357535,Scott,"It's a very nice apartment. It's in the CBD, so it can be a bit noisy, especially as there's construction on the building over. The host is very timely with communication and actually went above & beyond to help me."
2016-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Anita,"The room was really nice and tidy, and so was the kitchen. It was super convenient to get to the city centre as the trains in Sydney are really frequent and fast! 
Things to improve: I would say the mattress on the floor (3rd bed) got pretty uncomfortable after the 3rd night - especially because the blanket was so thin. The toilet got a bit messy since it was a shared bathroom (but this was due to the fault of the other guests, not the host). 
Overall, however, it was a great stay! We had a lot of fun in Sydney, and the accommodation was good :) "
2018-04-30T04:00:00.000Z,20865085,Traceypops,"The amenities are excellent and Jenny is a thoughtful, helpful and very welcoming host. There are all the things you needed,  a real home from home, even beach towels, picnic bag and some food in the fridge for tired travellers. The location is excellent - just a couple of minutes from the beach.  Excellent value for money."
2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,6170899,Valda," Three old friends arrived to share Jennifer's house for 5 days. On arrival Jennifer was there to greet us. She showed us around her beautiful house, had left us information about the local area and lots of travel pamphlets. She also invited us to use anything she had left in the fridge. This was really helpful as when you fly you don't bring any extra food etc. She had also left a bottle of wine and chocolates for us to munch on. The house was immaculately clean and beautifully decorated. The backyard was also great to look out onto and had the weather been better would have been beautiful to sit out in. The house is even better that the great photo's Jennifer has supplied to Air bnb. We spent an entire day exploring the area around Balmain and found lots of interesting places to visit. We felt very safe in that area and on 2 nights we returned to the house quite late after being out exploring all day. I have no hesitation in recommending this beautiful house to anyone and I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
2019-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,31391139,Genesis,Everything was perfect and clean
2016-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,9080393,Zt,"Perfect place to rest after a trip to the blue moutains before heading back to
Sydney! It has everything you need from TV, wifi to kitchen and laundry facilities. It's very clean and new and it has got quite enough space to accommodate 2 to 5 people."
2016-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Carmen,"This was a great place to stay. We spent a weekend here with two kids (under 12) so we could make an easy day trip to the Blue Mountains. Clean, private and secure."
2018-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Brendan,"Great value, nice touches including a beer in the fridge! No hassle stay"
2017-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Brigita,"Sehr sauber, ruhig und komfortabel. Und nah beim internationalen Flughafenterminal. Ich habe mich wohl gefühlt und war sehr zufrieden.  "

private and easy to check in. 

The location is great, an easy walk to Bronte Beach and Vivian even provided beach towels to use. 

It was a great please spend a weekend in Sydney and would happily stay again"
2017-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,19376053,Soledad,"Such a nice apartment , great location close to the starion . Great communication with the host ."
2018-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Anthony,The place was in a great location and is good value.
2017-07-01T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Daniel,"Paul was an excellent host who communicated well with us. Unfortunately he is not based in Australia and his local contact Wendy, the cleaner, was unhelpful and caused us to lose the first day of our holiday. The lock on the front door broke on the first afternoon and she originally said she couldn't get someone until after 6pm the following day. Thus we had to babysit the flat all afternoon and evening as we couldn't lock the door. We eventually got in contact with Paul who agreed to call an emergency locksmith. The locksmith didn't arrive until around 7.30pm, and it took until almost 8pm to fix the problem which Wendy was alerted to before 1.30pm. 

Additionally, Wendy agreed to watch the flat for us when the problem first occurred so we could get lunch. We picked up takeaway so as to return quickly but found her walking down the street two blocks away on our way back. The flat had been left unattended, unlocked, and with the door slightly ajar. This was completely unacceptable after having promised to stay and watch our belongings and Paul's flat. 

Overall, the apartment was decent. It is in an excellent location with just a 30 minute walk to the Opera House through the beautiful botanic gardens, and lots of cool cafes and restaurants on the street and nearby. The apartment has the potential to be great however it is not currently being maintained adequately, with some broken window locks, burnt out lights, and mould in the shower. Having had a bad experience with Wendy we did not contact her again during our stay and instead put up with these issues. Again, Paul was very helpful and did everything he could to help us. We did love staying in the area and would do so again, and hope that Paul is able to get a better cleaner/local contact in the future. "
2014-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Jennifer,"Fantastic. The apartment was perfect, so glad we booked this apartment. Bernadette was warm and welcoming having everything set out for us. You can tell that care was taking to have everything clean and ready for our arrival. All the kitchen basics and bathroom essentials like shampoo were provided. Even an extra yummy treat on arrival.  Great relaxing location in a relaxed neighborhood. I'm sure we will be back
"
2019-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Dave,"The moment you enter this Airbnb you realize this is a host who cares.  Chocolate on the coffee table, cold water in the fridge, cereal on the shelf, and roses in the bedroom greeted us.  Nine floors up you can hear the street noise but the bedroom is surprisingly quiet.  The location is near the metro and walkable to the waterfront.  This home and its location were perfect for our 6 night stay.  Would happily return on our next trip to Sydney."
2017-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,15745971,Vincent,"Very nice place to stay with great equipment like comfy sofa and beds, large TV, climate control etc. It takes some time to the central (20-30min iirc) but otherwise the location is good with a shop close by and bus stations around the block. Late sleepers might get woken up early by the sun if you wake up easily. The welcome was lovely and otherwise the communication was great. We enjoyed the stay!"
2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,22412815,Kieran,All rite
2014-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Romain,"Naveen and Tristan were absolutely amazing hosts. Very helpful and understanding, I get my bearings in this new city very quickly thanks to them. Their place is also so nice and next to everything! Not to forget the BBQ we had on the terrace ! I really enjoyed my stay and I wish we'll have the opportunity to meet again !"
2015-03-14T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Alvin,"Couldn't have asked for a better host than Miss D! Friendly, full of information and speedy response all the time.. 

Great place to get a good feel of Newtown.. Super close to the train station and plenty of food... Cafe options around.

Would definitely return to Newtown again! Thanks for everything Miss D :) till next time !"
2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,24460520,Kamie,Julia's place sits in a great location with a short walk to everything you'll need. Communication was prompt and the self check in process easy. There was everything I needed for the couple of days I was there and I'd definitely stay there again.
2016-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,9223554,Mark,"Gayles place is like her, amazing place amazing person. So relaxed and laid back. Thanks "
2018-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Jenny,Convenient location to shops. Taronga Zoo and Balmoral Beach are a short drive away. Rachel's pictures are an accurate depiction of the residence. Our family enjoyed our three night stay.
2017-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Tash,"A lovely little home tucked in the bush. This is one place in a battle axe street, meaning there are a couple of houses nestled into a hill in the bush. We stayed within the Avalon beach area, which is literally a three minute drive from the accomodation. There's a fantastic French restaurant and bakery close by and the breath-taking beach with a little ocean pool where you can do laps to burn off the croissants.

The house is well-stocked with tea, vegemite, pots, pans etc. Beds were comfortable and there were bathrobes to strut around in.  

We went at the start of winter and the place had enough heaters to keep it cosy. "
2017-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Daniel,"The apartment is very well located, you can walk to some main attractions, close to public transport and places to eat. Oliver and Hugo very good hosts."
2017-08-16T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Afnan,Amazing stay
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Michael,Great location and very clean and tidy - probably ready for a kitchen and bathroom upgrade!
2016-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,13302796,Nicole,"The host was very welcoming and communicative during the whole stay. The apartment location was excellent, really close to supermarkets and a train station. There was unfortunately alot of noise (construction), lack of basic toiletries and the spa was closed when we were there. "
2019-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,20865085,Harriet,"Jenny was a superb host and everything about the accommodation was excellent.  Situated in a prime beach location ideal for all beach lovers, early morning swims and evening walks are at your doorstep.  

A great comfortable bed, air conditioning and a great fan for warm nights made this stay comfortable.  

The living area is light and spacious, the bedroom was great with storage options, and it has a really good shower within a small bathroom. 

The stay was great and we will be returning in the future."
2017-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,19238057,Simon,"Great stay, great communication. Very much appreciated guys :)"

great geographic position and adequate sunshine~~"
2015-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,John,"Fantastic apartment, super hosts and very friendly dog. The flat is well positioned for access to the trains and buses making travel to CBD easy yet far enough out of the hussle and noise for a quiet mooch around Darlinghurst and Woolamooloo. "
2018-03-07T05:00:00.000Z,10416859,Lorna,"Unbelievable value, great facilities with stunning views to boot."
2018-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,20374683,Lee Len,There’s a short cut to walk from Central Station. Will be good to find the way thru the tunnel of the station
2018-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Andrea,"We had one amazing stay at Cathy's. The host is incredibly mindful, making sure everything is available for the guests. Location was super practical, the room was clean and Cathy was lovely! She was very helpful giving us tips on where to go, and made us feel very welcome."
2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,18338274,Jamie,"Beautiful house in a great location, easy to walk into city or the light rail is only a five minute walk from the house. Bill was very accommodating as we arrived two hours earlier than expected (party of six). Also let us stay longer than normal checkout time. Everything you need for your stay is detailed in the house manual, bill also took the time to show us around explaining the workings of the house. Only issue for us (Scottish folk) was we couldn’t open any of the windows as no fly screens, maybe not a problem for others though. Would recommend staying here."
2016-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,13442098,Ronnie,"the place was so nice with a beautiful view. I did my wedding's Chinese tea ceremony there. Nicole was a great host. Without her understanding and support, wedding wouldn't go as smoothly. I highly recommend the place.:)"
2016-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Steve,"We continue to chose to stay here because Susan is so caring and thoughtful. Everything is taken care of and all the extras like the tea selection, the chocolate and the fruit are lovely"
2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Jasmin,"Would highly recommend this place!! It’s in the center of Manly, 2 min to the beach, shops and wharf from where you can catch the ferry if you want to go to the city. Very clean as well which is one of the most important things for me. Very nice balcony as well. Thank you, Ziggy!"
2018-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Bridget,"Tracey’s place is wonderful! It is very modern and stylish yet cozy. Everything was sparkling clean and there was a lovely little selection of tea, coffee, breakfast foods etc. There is even a thoughtful guide with local restaurants and shops. I definitely recommend Tracey’s place and plan to stay there again."
2018-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,22378312,Alexander,The flat is near KingsCrossStation. Supermarket and Restaurants are near. The Host helps to enjoy the stay.
2018-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,5549057,Cassandra,"Brendan's spot is absolutely a DREAM! Just steps away from the beach, 333 bus line that goes to bondi junction toward the city, and tons of hip cafes that Bondi has to offer. Not to mention, Brendan is an extremely kind host. Our schedules didn't match up so I barely saw him, but it was lovely to meet him. Reviews talk about a big hill, which really isn't that big, so don't be deterred because of that. THANK YOU BRENDAN!"
2017-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,16087198,Arjun,Min was quick to respond even though I booked less than 24 hrs ahead. Room was bigger than I expected and clean. Min's parents showed me the room and they were very polite. Overall a very pleasant experience and great value for money.
2017-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Rachel,It was super easy to get to places and we loved walking over the bridge every day.
2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Daiyanti,Really nice place to stay in and also very fast replies from Ali! Thank you for your help!
2015-07-06T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Annemarie,Thank you Marcella for this lovely home. We so enjoyed our visit. Your description of the house and area was perfect and your attention to detail in all the instructions was outstanding. I would highly recommend your place. Thank you also for being so quick to get back to me each time I contacted you and for your flexibility. A huge thank you again
2018-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Jody,"Great location. Peaceful, perfect for relaxing. Great cafe's and coffee close by. Would definitely return."
2015-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,7439246,Lan,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2017-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,19254909,Melissa,"I nice tidy unit. However, if travelling in winter, just check if a heater is being provided as it gets very cold.
Also, if you need a car space, maybe ask if one can be blocked off or reserved for you, as the tenants take up all of the visitor spaces. "
2017-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,501382,Risako,the appartment was very clean and pretty. Location was absolutely perfect;  not in the center of the city but close enough!
2015-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Rebecca,Simone's house was perfect. She was a flexible and excellent host. Super close to town and extensive bus network. I almost didn't want to leave a great review in case other people want to book the place and I can't book it next time I'm in town! Thanks!
2018-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,5224098,Anna,"Everything is good, but there’s a little bugs in the kitchen. Tam is super nice, maybe next time we visit Sydney will choose the same house again!!"
2018-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,5549057,Vicky,"Brendan is very thoughtful and also a great host who cares about your convenience, safety, and basically everything! He provided a lot of travel information and planned an itinerary for my short trip. His house is very clean and tidy! We feel very comfortable during the stay. We have a good talk too! Thanks again Brendan."
2018-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,23222456,Byron,Beautiful place and a wonderful host - a home away from home. I've already booked my next stay and now consider myself a regular!
2018-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,23493822,Kimberley,Xiaowen was very accommodating to my request of an early check in. The space is great and everything you need for a short stay.
2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,17829178,Angela,"Great location, close to cool old pubs and bars and you can walk to Darling harbour, etc. 
Nice and new and clean inside, perhaps a bit dark though. 
Comfy bed, we slept well. 
Not much privacy when you open the door/ window for fresh air as you are right on the street, people can see straight in.
You are told to take all your rubbish with you on departure, which is a little inconvenient."
2017-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Niklas,Great Appartement which is good to reach by public transport. We really enjoyed our stay!
2018-04-17T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Ying,"Beautiful beachside studio with gorgeous views of Bondi beach.  Steps from icebergs, restaurants, bars, and waves!  Couldn’t have asked for a better stay and would definitely recommend it! Lots of thoughtful little touches by the host, including sunscreen and aloe for those who want to spend a lot of time at the beach!"
2018-07-19T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Lisa,Perfect in every way. Definitely my favorite place to stay for my regular work trips to Sydney.
2016-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Dan,Location very close to Central station makes everything in Sydney accessible. The restaurants and bars on crown street were perfect because we could relax close to home after a long day of site seeing. I would recommend this to anyone who likes living in a city and being a little outside of the tourist CBD. The apartment had everything we needed for a week long stay.
2016-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Romel,"The apartment is in the middle of everything in Sydney, full of dining and shopping options, close to transportation and excursion stops. We have small children and they very much enjoyed the area, as well as the apartment itself. The apartment is very clean, pleasant, and amenities for travellars are all ready to be used. Sabrina answered all of our questions promptly. Thanks so much!"

2014-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Tiffany,"My stay at this beatutiful home was memorable & exactly what I needed. The house reflected the way the pictures looked and the room was spacious and very comfortable & also secure. 
Paddinton was a lovely suburb with friendly people & great shopping, food, cafe's and bars.
Arnie & Lorraine were welcoming & even though I didn't meet Arnie until day 3 I felt at home and welcomed based on the energy & peace in the home.  Thank you!  I will definitely be back again in the future! Tiffany"

Good adress to stay."
2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Flora,"A very cozy place at a convenient location. Host is very responsive and considerate. We were allowed to check in early and there are helpful tips and travel books in the apartment for guests that are here for sightseeing.

The only thing we struggled a bit was the noise from the main road which could be challenging for light sleepers like myself.

Overall we had a good stay and would like to thank Paul for hosting us."
2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,13689460,Ashleigh,"Hayley & Jack were very welcoming and friendly. The location was great, comfortable room and clean bathroom. Would highly recommend and stay again if we were in Sydney. "

2015-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Pierre,"We spent a week in Tamarama and it was wonderful ! The appartment is really nice and ideally located with a stunning view on the ocean. It was so good to wake up in the morning and to hear the swell ! On top of that,  Wayne's organization has been perfect and everything worked well.  If we return to Sydney one day, which I hope, we'll definitely come back to Wayne and Kate's place !

Thanks so much
Pierre"

Belinda is a friendly and gracious host - easy communication, lovely welcome. The garden studio is delightful - immaculate and beautifully and comfortably furnished, it has everything you could need. Love sitting on the little deck with my book and a glass of wine! 
Great location close to beaches and bush walks. Peaceful, private, secure."
2016-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Lucille,J'ai passé un séjour agréable chez Duncan. La chambre est très confortable et la résidence est proche des transports pour un accès facile au centre-ville. Je n'ai pas passé beaucoup de temps avec les hôtes parce que nous étions tous très occupés mais ce sont des personnes adorables et qui font en sorte de rendre le séjour très agréable. Merci à eux !

Hilde was very welcoming and obviously takes a lot of pride in providing a place that is comfortable, inviting and clean. She has great attention to detail, the house had everything we needed, good aircon for the summer and a well set up kitchen which made cooking a BBQ easy. Hilde provided us with a lovely breakfast with delicious home made bread, jams, muesli and tea and coffee. The house is in a great location within easy walking distance from the beach and shops. 
Thanks very much for having us Hilde! "
2015-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Jane,Linda's apartment is tidy and located near CBD and transportation to everywhere. Linda is nice and ready to provide help anytime. The apartment provide anything you need during the stay. I will recommend to friends definitely.
2018-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Colin,"This is as advertised, very clean, large, close to bus and with a lovely water view. I especially enjoyed swimming in the free, saltwater rock pool only two minutes away. I even ventured a swim across the bay and back on a calm water day. We both loved listening to the ocean waves for a week!Very quiet neighbourhood as well. Highly recommend this to others. Be advised, it is a 1 hour bus ride to Sydney CBD."

Our Room was really nice furnished and really comfortable! Unfortunatly the room was a bit noisy at night because the window went towards the street. The shared kitchen and lounge were nice. all in all we had a really nice stay here.

2015-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Bernard,"It was the 3rd time we stayed at Kerri’s place and it was as perfect as the 1st time.
The room is nicely decorated and big enough for accommodate comfortably 2 people and the bathroom next door was for our private use only. 
Kerri is a very communicative and interesting person, always ready for a chat and a glass of wine on the terrace or in the large living area.
The apartment is well located, on walking distance from Stanmore train station, which is at about 20 min from CBD.
I would recommend this place without hesitation to anyone who is looking for a comfy stay in Sydney.

Glebe itself is a vibrant place within easy access of the city centre. It has a village feel, with plenty of restaurants and bars (we ate there every night).  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Elizabeth's place and would definitely put it top on our places to stay when in Sydney."

2017-01-30T05:00:00.000Z,5469086,Jennifer,"Anitta's place was perfect for the 2 of us. Its walking distance to the beach and the tree line outside makes it feel so tropical. It's a close drive shops, beaches and CBD.

Serena (and her mum, who kindly checked us in) was a very welcoming host, who was extremely responsive to any queries before and during our stay. It's right near kings cross, and we were there on the weekend, but no problems with noise, and we slept really well."
2018-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Chloe,"We had a great stay at Philips place. So nicely decorated, favourite space was the living and kitchen area. We loved that there was a bathroom with each of the bedrooms, even surprisingly a shower in the attic ! Location was great, surrounded by great food and not a far walk to Sydneys CBD. Philip was very accommodating on arrival and offered us a map with suggestions of things he likes to do around the city. Also very quick with responses with whatever we needed. Would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone looking to stay somewhere great in Sydney :) "
2017-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Nicole,Nice apartment in a great location. Stairs are a bit tricky as place on 4 levels. Very good value though
2018-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,23222456,Michelle,"Very poor condition, it is too old to stay . It is uncomfortable to use the bathroom at all . There r lots of messy stuff to put in the limited space . It was the bad experience to stay . And it is with long distance from railway station. There are too many rules and restrictions in this house . Bad feeling. The couple could not be able to enjoy nice sleeping because the bed made the much  noise ."
2016-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,Nicki,A wonderful place and host. Cheers.
2018-07-12T04:00:00.000Z,24460964,Yuxuan,It’s a fantastic place for living! Not far away from the train station and shopping center. 10 mins from Chinatown.
2016-10-18T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Mary,Eleanor told me that it was a great place!
2016-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Erina,We loved our stay at Belinda's beautiful beach cottage. We have stayed before and will definitely stay again :) Thank you.
2018-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Amy,Wendy’s place was immaculate and stylish. Was perfect for a short stay and close to public transport and the city. Wendy’s communication was friendly and prompt. Would highly recommend.
2018-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,21939239,Karen,This place was great. Only stayed a night but very clean and had everything I needed. Don was very helpful in showing me everything. Would recommend.

2019-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Holly,"Mariana was a lovely host, met me with the keys and took the time to show me around the unit and how everything worked. The unit was sparklingly clean, the kitchen and bathroom are really nicely renovated and set out well. Although i stayed during a heat wave the fans kept me very comfortable. I’d definitely stay again."
2017-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Adam,Place was great - perfectly located. Would recommend and I will definitely book again
2016-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,Maasa,Our stay at Kath's place was wonderful! She was friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. The location was easily accessible to the train station as well.
2018-06-14T04:00:00.000Z,24460520,Jes,This is a very cute apartment in a great location. Close to trains and only a 25 minute walk to the Botanic Gardens and the city. Would recommend!
2017-08-28T04:00:00.000Z,18338274,Jeff,Great house and location highly recommend
2016-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,7920463,Ryan,I had a great time in the two weeks spent with Konrad and Mish. Felt more like living with housemates than anything else. Konrad took me out on a few mountain bike trails bearing in mind I haven't rode a bike in years but that didn't deter him. Nice location and great company would highly recommend....just don't ask Konrad for his review on your food as you will get the review of an Australia Manu
2018-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Dave,"Ziggy's place was clean, nicely furnished and had all the amenities and services I needed, with plenty of towels, bathroom items etc. The apartment was light and airy, with good facilities and a nice balcony. The location is excellent for everything Manly has to offer. Ziggy was well organised and friendly - an excellent host and I would have no hesitation in stopping here again."
2016-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,13442098,Yvonne,Nicole was a great host. Always prompt with her responses and the apartment as well as the view was excellent. We'd like to thank Nicole for allowing us to stay the night whilst we prepared for the wedding.
2014-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,1229797,Adrienne,Perfect place to stay a couple of days to visit Sydney ! Irene is an amazing host !
2018-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,10416859,Chris,"Leslie and her family were very welcoming and thoughtful, so many generous offers to ensure our stay was perfect which it was."
2017-09-18T04:00:00.000Z,16898275,Georgina,"Pleasant, comfortable, spacious apartment. Clean and presentable. Bathroom towels are provided, bedrooms are nicely made up. Apartment owner fantastic for communication in the lead up to booking and confirming.  Apartment is welcoming and would recommend. Apartment is on first floor, so there is one flight of stairs to consider. While off-street parking is available, it may be a bit tricky to find as Rose Bay is a very popular area- keep in mind."
2016-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,10423504,Emily,"Cat's flat was ideal for our needs -- three generations visiting North Bondi together. Two bathrooms felt like luxury (as did the king size bed), and the flat was super convenient to great restaurants (Mamasan and Avila were both tasty in their own ways, and right around the corner) and the beach. Shopping and tasty gelato (our kids were staunch advocates for the Messina Gelato) were only a slight stone's throw further away on Hall St. 

Having coffee available in the morning was a particular treat (thank you again, Cat), and there were ample cookbooks to review if we had had the time to really use the kitchen. Communications with Cat were easy for checking in and out; we didn't need to trouble her during our visit because the replacement light bulbs were easy to find when one fixture burnt out. We would definitely consider staying here again. "
2017-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Verne,Sarah was really nice and very accomodating. She greeted us as soon as we got to the place and gave us a quick tour . The place was really clean and quiet as well. Would recommend to other travelers.
2014-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Pia,We really enjoyed staying at Susan's. The hut we lived in was really comfortable and very clean. Susan is a very nice person and gave us all kind of information we might have needed for our stay in Sydney. She was very helpful with our other issues. Susan's place made our stay in Sydney a lot more comfortable and enjoyable!
2018-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Robert,"This is our second time using an Airbnb venue.
The first was a brilliant experience and we were keen to try again. 
Unfortunately not so good the second time around.
The property read really well so we went ahead and booked. 
Location is great and we understand you pay a premium price for this.
The positives were that the beds weren’t the worst we have ever slept in.
The apartment is tired generally but as stated by the owner it’s someone’s home so we shouldn’t be too harsh. We do think though that when renting out for significant amounts then the basics of cleanliness and equipment that is not held together with masking tape should be standard.
Thanks anyway but perhaps we will stick to hotels in future so we don’t have to do the washing etc."
2018-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,23510317,Nicole,The flat is very central - it takes only a few minutes to the central train station! It was very clean and comfortable.
2013-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,1098211,Jackie,"Serena's place is superbly located, pretty much across the road from King's Cross, a short walk into the CBD with easy access to public transport. We stayed for a weekend, and were lucky enough to be able to check in on the Friday morning, as there hadn't been anyone staying in the apartment the night before. Serena greeted us, gave us advice about the area, and had even made us a breakfast hamper complete with home made jam!

The apartment had everything we needed, and was very nicely decorated. The only down side was a fair bit of nighttime noise, as it is located in quite a happening area and we were there over the weekend. Luckily we're not particularly light sleepers so we were still able to sleep.

Overall it was a great weekend, and we would definitely stay there again."
2019-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,27789416,Oleg,It was a very comfy stay! Will definitely stay here next time.
2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,23428550,Steve,So close to shopping centre / cheap eats and bus route. Clean; secure and would stay again. Thanks for the hospitality.

2017-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Zoe,Great if you're going to Olympic park for a concert! It's easy to walk to Rhodes Stn or you can even catch a bus there. Lovely and scenic and really modern! Definitely worth the money :)
2018-03-27T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Annett,"Perfekt gelegen, in wenigen Minuten zum öffentlichen Nahverkehr, Cafés etc., ruhig und doch mittendrin.

2015-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Leilane,"Linda's apartment is a cozy place where you feel at home. It has a great location, near train station and close to the city. Unfortunately we were there for only two days, but we would like to stay much more. Linda is very careful, left all instructions and worried about all the details for our comfort. We even had food available in the kitchen, which was extremely important in the early days of adaptation. We can only thanks and recommend Linda's place eyes closed."

2016-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Ritchie,"Millie was a wonderful host. The studio was super clean and tidy, and had good wifi and a comfortable bed. Best of all, though, was the amazing view to enjoy from the little balcony. I will definitely recommend to friends."
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,6066694,Deborah,"We loved this home - so quiet and family friendly, yet so close to everything. We could walk to all the great beaches - Tamarama, Bronte and Bondi, and enjoyed having great shops and cafes just a couple of minute's walk away. Nicola's home is a lovely way to experience the best of Sydney life and she was great to deal with - super responsive and helpful with local information. "
2018-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,16964637,Yogesh,Very good and peaceful stay. Internet  Kitchen was up to the expectation.Thanks for a comfortable stay.

Great communication from Mal made things simple and straight forward and he has plenty of local knowledge for first time visitors...
All in all a great stay..."
2017-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,17319927,Luke,Lynne was great host. We locked our keys in and she was so helpful getting us back in. Great location in quiet street yet so close to the hub of bondi.
2018-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,15312988,StarCu,I really enjoy my stay here. Cindy’s house is really cozy and very comfortable. And both Cindy and Claudio are very nice person. I will live here again the next time I come to Sydney.
2017-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Partha,Linda is a great host very responsive in answering queries. Place looks tired and more scrubbing is required. Location is good but the neighbourhood is sketchy for family stay
2019-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Rachel,Lovely unit- quiet and clean. Good place to stay to explore the northern beaches from. Had a great stay here and was easy to arrange how to access the place. Thanks for the great weekend!
2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Claire,Rachel's home is beautifully decorated and has a gorgeous outdoor sitting area. Walking distance from Mosman village cafes and restaurants.
2016-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,13562321,Fred,Joanna and Ali's place is nicely located in the CBD and close to anything you need. The home is neatly kept and well presented. My interstate guest enjoyed the stay and any issue that came up was quickly looked after.

2016-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Hung,The place was great and exactly as described.  The location was great and Nicole was helpful in explaing the area upon our arrival. Would definitely stay here again if visiting Sydney again.
2016-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Elizabeth,The location was great for our interests.  We literally walked everywhere we wanted to go and we got around.  There are so many great things to see near Mezzo's Studio.  Our check-in and check-out were easy and our requests were handled in a helpful and friendly manner.  I highly suggest this location and the price can't be beat!
2016-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Jennifer,"Great quiet private cottage,in central location.Susan is a great host making our stay very pleasant.We would stay here again."

2015-08-03T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Judy,"Nicole was able to meet us at the apartment to show us details about the use of keys and the security system and other provisions in the apartment.
The location was ideal for what we intended to do in Sydney being a short walk to Crown Street and it was near our family who we were visiting.  Transport to The Opera House and The Sydney Theatre Company was also an easy taxi ride.
The living and kitchen area in the apartment was spacious and light and airy, while the bedroom was discretely placed behind a wall divide. Even though the bathroom was on the small side, it was well equipped with hair dryer, soap, shampoo and all you would need for a short or longer stay. (We often want to do washing when we are away,  but not this time). The apartment was clean and tidy with a very comfortable lounge. There was a great deal of cupboard space in the bedroom as well."
2014-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Arnold,"Perfect location in a truly special house. The room was lovely and very clean;  and as quiet as confortable. Arnie was very arranging and helpful. We stayed a total of 3 nights. Paddington is a great area of Sydney, very central. You can go anywhere from here, the bus stop was very close.I would highly recommend anybody to stay here. "
2019-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,24863216,Anna,"Vivian’s place was exactly as advertised. Well located, cosy yet spacious, comfortable, and with a lot of thoughtful extra touches. Perfect place to stay when you want to experience the most iconic beaches of Sydney."

Evelyn took us in a short notice without hassle and it was exactly what we were hoping for and more. A beautiful spot with wonderful views. Perfect for a quiet weekend away surrounded by nature. Thanks for having us. Highly recommend. "
2017-04-30T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Ebony,"A cute little get away, very well presented and lovely location. The train is unquie, with great features. Margaret was very hospitable, and thought of all the little touches. 
Thank you very much. "
2016-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Vicki,Cathy met us on arrival and made us feel comfortable. As we were arriving back after dark Cathy left an outside light on for us. Decor in the room was tasteful and we had an enjoyable overnight stay.  We really appreciated the very comfortable bed and bedding and the delicious continental breakfast. Car access was great and we parked right next to our room. The room was well fitted out with everything we needed. We will be back.
2018-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,9802077,Ming-Ting,"My wife and I were very fortunate to stay at Helena’s place as our first stop in Australia. Helena is very considerate. She welcomed us with fresh fruits, drinks, and chocolates which gave us a very warm feeling after a long flight from the U.S. The apartment was clean, roomy, and well equipped with all we need for a month’s long stay. Fast Wifi made our work efficient. Helena was extremely informative and responsive. Her place locates at an excellent location, in a quiet and very nice neighborhood. A very short walk to bus-stop and light-rail station took us to anywhere at Sydney. The apartment is within walking distance to lots of nice shops, eateries, water-fronts, Fish Market, Broadway Mall, and the University of Sydney.  We enjoyed the morning walks to the nearby bayside park and Saturday’s interesting Glebe Market. We highly recommend Helena’s place for a business/leisure stay."
2016-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,10416859,Lorraine,Very clean and confortable. Nice view on the bay.
2018-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,16070079,Anna & Sebastian,The place is perfectly located. We loved how easy it was to check-in.
2015-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,652063,William,"Had a very enjoyable five night stay at Hernan's unit while in Sydney for a seminar. The room, while cosy, was well appointed with a queen sized bed, wardrobe, blinds and a chest of drawers and a desk which I appreciated. The unit also has a light living area and kitchen. As a host Hernan, who is Chilean, was well travelled, friendly and a good conversationist with good local knowledge. Coupled with the location near the beach, good restaurants and a bus to the train station the unit is good value for money. Would stay again."
2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,23106836,Sebastian,Good place to stay and relax away from the city. The backyard is beautiful.
2015-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,1979960,David,"The house is well situated in a pleasant suburb taking only about 15-20 minutes to walk into Sydney and is also close to major bus routes for exploring further afield, as well as having shops and restaurants nearby. The house is quite spacious, and equipped with all the necessary appliances, including wifi, to make the stay most enjoyable. If the weather had been better during our holiday then we would have made more use of the balconies that provide impressive views of the city. The house was clean and tidy when we arrived and the entry instructions were quite clear. Jeremy was very accommodating by arranging an early check in and  late check out.      "
2017-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Naomi,Cath's studio is really lovely.  A cozy set-up with everything you need plus some very kind considerations from Cath in the hamper.  I would certainly stay there again.
2013-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Greg,"Staying with Kerri was my first airbnb experience and it could not have been better. Right from the moment I made the reservation, Kerri welcomed me with an offer of directions, which as it turned out I didn't need as her place was very easy to find. The apartment is beautiful and comfortable with much attention to detail. I was given a great bedroom with a very comfy bed and had my own beautifully appointed private bathroom. The place had the feel of a five star hotel, but with the added bonus of Kerri's friendliness. Immediately downstairs is a very cool cafe serving awesome breakfasts, so I ended up passing up the generous continental style breakfast that Kerri had offered me. The apartment location is perfect, as just down the road is the lively area of Newtown with its many bars and restaurants. I highly recommend staying with Kerri and look forward myself to staying there again in the future."
2019-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,2900140,Annabelle,Excellent location. Short walk to beach and cafes/shops. Perfect for a wkd away. Very welcoming hosts.

2015-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Melissa,"Wayne and Kate made us feel incredibly welcome even before we arrived. They were very helpful giving us great advice on surfboard hire and local eateries which were easily accessible in this beautiful neighbourhood. The apartment itself lived up to all our expectations. It was light-filled, clean, warm and welcoming with stunning views and provided ample space for the 6 of us (two grandparents, us and our two kids) to relax. Going to sleep with the sound of the surf was so restful and the beds really comfy. And the chocolates and sparkling were a lovely touch! Thanks Wayne and Kate. We loved our stay and would definitely return. "
2016-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,13562321,Elsa,"It's a convenient one bedroom apt for one person, if you don't need wifi (which is rare and unbelievable), neither a long and relaxing hot bath (there's prob with hot water, I kept it low to avoid running out of hot water at the end of my shower), nor a quiet sleep in the morning (massive noise in the neighborhood due to tram construction). This apt is all about location in the city."

Would definitely stay here again.

2016-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Lawrence,"Stayed at Sabrina's place for almost a week.  As I need to checked in early due to young kids, Sabrina was helpful in granting early check-in :) 
The place was neat and clean upon check-in. Initially there was only one heater and request to have extra heaters were met on the same day. Sabrina bought two new heaters and I am very thankful for that.  Another good thing that happened was the new wifi installed ;) 
Location wise is very good. Minutes walk to Darling Harbour and the Central Station Light Rail. Bus 389 is round the corner to take you to the Sydney CBD which is only one stop away. 
Generally we enjoyed Sabrina's place and will go back again.

Die Lage in Surry Hills, in der Nähe der Central Station, haben wir sehr genossen. Leider haben wir Nicole nicht persönlich zur Schlüsselübergabe antreffen können, sie hat aber eine gute Alternative für uns organisiert. Die Kommunikation mit Nicole verlief einwandfrei und immer sehr schnell. Gerne wieder!"

Highly recommended for travellers coming to Sydney."
2015-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,4164487,Margaret,Duncan and Ashlee are perfect AirBnb hosts - their place is lovely and nothing was too much trouble. Their apartment is located very close to the city - just a quick bus trip. Highly recommend staying here if you are in Sydney!

2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Corey,"This is a very basic room in the downstairs apartment of a nice home. It's very no-frills, but for the price, hard to beat. When they say walking distance to the airport, they mean it, it's about 15 minutes on mostly bike path and you're at the terminal. I wouldn't spend a long holiday here, but for someone needing a quick, cheap place to lay your head down for an evening before an early flight, it's hard to beat."
2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,20906942,Vithuran,Amazing location
2017-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Isabel,"Das Zimmer und das Badezimmer waren sauber, auch die Küche sah sehr gepflegt aus. Trotz unserer späten Ankunft hat alles super geklappt"
2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,22268452,Sabrina,"Nice place, very close to Rose Bay (5 mins walk) where you can easily hop on the ferries. You can find some small shops nearby for almost everything you need. Also, Shaun's hospitality was the best and he was more than willing to help and explain how to get around the city!"

Très bien "

2014-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Barb,"Kerri’s place and Kerrie are special, even better than the pictures.  I selected Kerri’s accommodation for ease of commuting by train and the beautiful décor.  I balked at the prospect of hauling all my luggage up a slight hill to her place, and Kerri cheerfully was at the Petersham station in 5 minutes on a Saturday afternoon to drive me to her apartment.  I found the Stanmore Station (less than a 15 minute walk past some nice houses) easier, and walked it at night and felt safe.  I was at Kerri’s for a demanding conference, and being at her place was like a relaxing resort.  The home ambiance is so beautiful and the plant and sun make it a very special home away from home.  Some of the memorable touches:  really soft sheets, a well-appointed private bathroom, a friendly cat, the self-serve breakfast of fruit/cereal/yogurt laid out in the morning (one morning she left eggs and a tomato with a pan and spatula too), the plants and view from the veranda where I ate and read, and the lovely decorations from her travels.  There’s also a nice, upscale grocery just down the street.  We didn’t see too much of each other, and the lengthiest time we spent was when Kerri generously took me to my rental car office in Mascot near the airport.   Kerri’s friendly and adaptable when you have odd plans like I did.  It was a treat to stay here!

2017-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Fiona,Excellent location and good value for money. Not the cheapest place but it was well worth the cost - nice little extras eg. milk were waiting for us in the fridge which was a great touch! The balcony and view is lovely!

Great location, 2 minute walk to the bus stop and beach. Thanks for everything Hernan, especially the aquarium!"
2017-05-21T04:00:00.000Z,8121226,Alessandra,Jenny is the most ideal host and that's  because she's just a lovely human being. Everything was most ideal. Being completely new to Airbnb myself I felt safe and comfortable. Is there anything more you'd want?

2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,22304343,Sasha,"Our family of 4 had fantastic time staying at Sarah’s stylish place with  harbor view! We could not wish for a better place for New Year’s Eve. 3 minutes walk from the major transport hub, close to the CBD  and Bondi beach. Sarah was a great host who looked after us and made sure we were very comfortable. Super fast communication, clean place, fast WiFi, much more! Thank you Sarah for being our host!  Highly recommended. "
2017-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,18345625,Carlos,"Great place, location and room. Fiona was a great host and she also let us use a tv room in the second floor. Room and bathroom were clean and we had everything we needed. She provided guidance on public transport and places to visit. Jackson, her dog, is lovely and very calm.

2017-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,20578419,Pippa,"A lovely, clean and conveniently located apartment, well appointed and communication with Max and Su was exceptional. A few broken item items that can be easily fixed would have made my visit 5 star."

They are good company and easy conversationalists.  We traded many enjoyable travel stories and their kavoodle ""felix"" is also a delight.  It took us only 25 minutes to leisurely walk to the City from their apartment.  Our room had a huge window view and own bathroom.  The pool and gym are right next to their apartment - very handy."
2014-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,781631,Cat,"Mike is one of the most easy going guys ever and immediately makes you feel at home! He is all to happy to let you into his world and introduce you to the cool places to go, things to see and his love for art, music and culture definitely shines through with the tasteful art-deco furniture he has in his flat. The flat is in a great location to explore Sydney and the Potts Point scene and minutes from Kings X. I had a wonderful time during my stay there and made a friend for life! "

2016-05-23T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Alison,"This is a lovely little place for a night away. The cabin has everything you could possibly  need - a bed, sofa, dining table, tv and shower. All put together in a small but aesthetically pleasing cabin. Really appreciated that fresh milk was provided plus tea and coffee and very tasty muesli. It has very quite location  and perfectly situated  for launching a kayak ( across the road). Also 10 minutes walk from the Clareville kiosk for that special meal."
2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Kelly,"Angela’s place could not have been more perfect for our stay. Private, quiet, clean and beautiful! The amenities are amazing, everything from bathroom products to beach chairs, towels, and beautiful bread, fruit, cheeses and champagne for our arrival. This place is a rare find in Avalon!"
2015-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Pranab,"Apartment is in excellent location- 2 min walking distance to Darling harbour and 15min to Opera house.  Gavin was very responsive to our queries. Everything was accurate as advertised. There is also one laminated information sheet in the apartment describing how to use WiFi, etc. That's really nice. I would recommend this place to those who wants to stay heart of CBD. One of two building lifts was not stopping on this apartment's floor.  It was not fixed by building management during our stays (probably due to Christmas holidays).  "
2019-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,24477058,Curtis,Epic place
2016-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,5469086,Nils,"We really enjoyed our stay, thank you. Cosy and homely apartment with very comfortable beds (and fast wifi). We really appreciated the personal touch, toys + kids towels for our son and the homely feel. Bronte is lovely in its own right and it's a good location to explore the rest of Sydney. "

We will certainly be recommending this place to friends.

2018-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Nance,"Paradise Found!  This property is even better than the photos depict -- if you are looking for an idyllic escape in a relaxing atmosphere with fabulous views, this is the place.  Evelyn is a fantastic host who made us feel like locals.  The addition of having your own private, refreshing pool at your doorstep makes Pittwater Paradise an ideal location for a weekend getaway, or a longer stay.  We thoroughly enjoyed our two weeks at Pittwater Paradise."
2015-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Sansan,"We loved Paul's apartment! It's right in the middle of Potts Point and is about 5 minutes away from Kings Cross rail station. There's Woolie's a fee minutes away and coffee places all over! Room 10, which is right next door from the back served amazing coffee!

The apartment was very clean and has a lot of character. It certainly felt like we were staying at someone's home and not just a random hotel. We especially loved the book collection!

Overall, it was an awesome experience and we would definitely stay here again if we come back to Sydney. "
2016-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,7439246,Lizzie,"Nathan was a very helpful and considerate host. The flat is in a fantastic location, full of lovely things and very comfortable. He left us chocolates and some fancy soap which were nice touches. Local transport is really good and the beach is amazing."
2018-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,26340840,Andrew,It was a great stay and beautiful home. Half our dance crew stayed at Franca and Alessio's place whilst we rehearsed for our upcoming premiere - it was a massive week and we really loved coming back to this gorgeous house.
2019-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,15312988,Nathalia,Claudio and Cindy are a really nice and friendly couple. You can ask them anything. Also the room was very nice and clean. Great place to stay!

2015-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,794910,Winnie,"Gavin is a nice guy to make my first Bnb experience fantastic. I appreciate him to host us after his long distance trip with jet lag. We were easy to talk with and get along well with each other. There're all same as describe, even much better than it, special room, comfy bed, clean and well-appointed home, excellent location... My mum and me definitely enjoyed staying at Gavin's place. There's no doubt that I will be there. I highly recommend you to stay at Gavin's place. "
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Tina,"Again we had an amazing time. The place was clean, beds were comfortably and checkin was a breeze. The view and backyard down to the beach is what this place is all about!  Bailey is a great host, we will no doubt stay again. Just a note for those that cannot stand heat the place has no air conditioning so it gets very hot during day and night but there are fans and the beach right at the doorstep to cool off."
2015-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,Michelle,"Staying at Mal's place was an absolute delight.  The photos are true to the decor but cannot begin to properly describe how wonderful it is to be perched up in your ""Sydney home"" watching the world go by on Bondi Beach. The best location in Sydney by far! And Mal is the perfect host.  So quick to respond to all enquiries and goes above and beyond to make your stay really special.  Thanks for everything  Mal. I am telling all my friends in NZ about your place and coming back for sure.  Mals tip for Jo and Willy Depot Cafe was brilliant. .. Great food.  Great people.  Not touristy. Made you feel like a local."

2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Frank,"Die Unterkunft war perfekt. Die Lage unschlagbar und wir hatten nicht mit so einer Ausstattung gerechnet. Deshalb haben wir einige Dinge mitgebracht, die wir aber nicht (Website hidden by Airbnb) war wirklich Alles da. Anita war die perfekte Gastgeberin, die sogar den Kuehlschrank etwas gefuellt hatte, da wir zu den Feiertagen ankamen. Es war sogar frisches Brot da. Den wagen konnten wir bequem unten in der Garage abstellen und mussten nur mit dem Aufzug in unsere Etage fahren. Die Aussicht vom Bett war ein Traum. Alles war sehr sauber und geschmackvoll modern eingerichtet. Das WLAN hat perfekt funktioniert und war schnell genug sogar fuer grosse Dateien. Wir kommen gerne bald wieder. Danke Anita."
2016-06-13T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Stuart,Margaret and her husband well very welcoming hosts in making us feel at home . The train carriage was lovely to stay in and amazing nature at which they stay on with some lovely little Bush walks down by the Creek. Would love stay there again with lovely genuine down to earth people ... Who treated us with some home made apple pie before we left .
2017-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,John,"Natasa's place is very comfortable with a nice big room and great share bathroom. Natasa is very friendly and helpful and I enjoyed my stay very much, over 3 weeks! Very handy to transport, both trains and bus and conveniently between Petersham's Portuguese and Leichhardt's Italian restaurants. Fabulous place to stay! "

2016-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Manuel,"Hernan was kind enough to accept our booking on very short notice. We arrived in Sydney a day earlier than we had planned and he was able to accommodate us for the night. His place is quiet and cozy, just what we needed. The beach nearby is gorgeous and has a couple good restaurants. All in all a great experience for our first day in Australia!"
2018-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,23493822,Denise,"Clean, modern space with a separate entrance to the main house. The hosts were extremely hospitable. Do note that the room is smaller than it looks in the photo, but that wasn’t a problem at all because it was enough for 2 people to stay for just a night. Overall a lovely stay, and I would book this place again in future."
2017-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Binh,Great place for a bunch of ppl who love traveling
2016-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Vagish,Really central and close to everything. Great balconies and very clean. Well stocked and we had a great time there!
2018-06-27T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Elise,"Tracey's place was really comfortable, clean and stylish. It was also in a great location as we went into Newtown area for a concert and food - we caught the train in and then uber home - both which were super easy to do. Street parking was really easy as well."
2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Aimee,"Vickie has been such a wonderful host, and the apartment was the perfect space for my weekend escape to Sydney. Super close to the shops, local cafes and also the harbour. What more could one ask for?"

2017-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,美珠,"非常适合度假,周边就是风景,又有超市,生活很方便"
2018-03-27T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Tara,"Myself, my partner and our two boys (11 and 6 months) stayed for 4 nights at Jared’s apartment.
PROS..
Location is fantastic, close to Circular Quay which was great for us.
Size of the place was very comfortable.
Air conditioning works really well.
Kitchenette is well equipped for a short stay (small fridge, sink, microwave, kettle, toaster)
Beds were comfy and sofa bed had been made up ready for our stay.
WiFi was a great plus, and although we didn’t use it much it was nice to have it.
Check in was easy and the communication was excellent.

CONS..
Condition of the place left a lot to be desired. There was left over dirt on the carpet (bits and pieces, food, pieces of crayon) when we arrived. 
The bathroom needs to be stripped out and replaced, there are tiles missing, the bath tub is in terrible condition, there’s visible mold, the shower screen does nothing and you end up with a completely wet and slippery bathroom floor every time it’s used. 
There’s a bunch of exposed wires that have been carelessly taped to a skirting board in the kitchen area, fun when there’s a crawling baby exploring the place!
Air con, while it worked great, the dial is broken so its hard to know when it’s on or off.

I’d recommend a set of ear plugs for anyone staying here as there’s road works outside at the moment so there’s a bit of noise, as well as the apartment sharing a wall with the elevator shaft and a fair bit of noise coming from the roof (top floor apartment). 

Overall we had a great trip but for the money we spent we could have stayed in a nicer Airbnb (as we have in Sydney before)."
2017-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,2889953,Eunice,"First of all, this is a place really makes me feel at home! Aunt Jyoti and and uncle Urtum are very hospitable and kindness. I have to mention when I came back late in one night, they messaged me and confirmed whether I was OK.  Regarding to the house, there is a well decorated and pretty house in a very quite, beautiful and safe neighbor. More importantly, it is so convenient because it only takes less then 5mins to bus station and newington market place. "
2018-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Charmian,"We stayed at Paul’s place in Manly for three nights. It’s a comfortable, clean two bed apartment with pretty much all the amenities you’d need. The location was perfect - very close to shops, restaurants, the Wharf (where you can catch the ferry to the city) and a short walk to the beach. 

The street the apartment is on was quiet. There is major building works going on next door but it was on the side of the bathroom and kitchen so didn’t bother us too much. Parking on the street can be a bit tricky and as it’s a one way street you can find yourself going round in circles looking for a space.

Paul was quick to respond to all my messages. I was hoping for a bit more flexibility with checking in and out times as we arrived very early to Sydney and had to leave late but there was no negotiating on this. Luckily we had friends in the city who helped us out on both days.

Overall we had a pleasant stay. I would recommend the apartment if you want to stay in a laid back area of Sydney, close to a beach but still with good transportation into the city."
2017-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,20804897,Karolis,The host canceled this reservation 98 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2017-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Pascal,"We had a great stay at this airbnb. The apartment was easy to access and Michele was very communicative and helpful. The apartment is well situated with close distance to both buses and the train station. Michele also provided some treats for us in the fridge upon arrival, which was very appreciated. However, we want to point out that the apartment is very perceptive. We got kindly told that we were too loud at 10:30 pm, and out of our four mornings we woke up to a screaming child twice. Apart from that we are very happy with this stay."
2017-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,16964637,Emily,"A lovely, comfortable, room in a very nice house. Everything was clean and it was within walking distance of Macquarie Park and University."

2016-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,13442098,Claire,"Fantastic, almost brand-new, nicely decorated, very clean, well-cared for apartment on the 18th floor.  Minutes walk to Olympic Park train station, 10 mins walk to Quodos Arena.  More than enough space for 5 of us.  2 double bedrooms (one ensuite with double shower) and a comfortable sofa bed.  2 bathrooms (one with a large bath).  We were met by Vicky who gave us the keys and entry fob for the carpark.  We didn't meet Nicole, but she was in constant communication during our stay to make sure that all was well.  The apartment has fantastic views and is light and airy. Nice touches were the bowl of fruit, plate of lollies and chocolates, biscuits, milk in the fridge and teabags.  We were really impressed and would certainly recommend a stay here.  Such fantastic value compared to the hotels in the immediate vicinity."
2015-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Trudy,"Belinda and Chris have been wonderful hosts! 
We loved our stay at their garden studio. They  thought of everything for our comfort and relaxation even though the temperate outside dropped to 6 degrees we were very comfortable. The location is also excellent being right within Royal National park with magnificent bush walks at your doorstep, thank you very much for having us, 
"
2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,30412858,Lauren,"The location of this apartment is amazing, it is right next door to Darling Harbour. So that is the best feature by far! It was clean and had 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. There is a large baby cot in the main bedroom which takes up a lot of space if you are not needing it!
It was clean and well cared for. 
The swimming pool and spa on the roof is fantastic!!
Compared to other places I have stayed in, this one seemed to be pretty basic as there was really no added touches. But it’s functional and a good apartment"
2017-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Tegan,"A lovely place with a really cute loft bedroom, a comfortable downstairs area and Cath left us various goodies to make our breakfast. Cath has lovely garden spaces with chickens, and an area to sit and soak in the sun. Easy street parking and walking distance to cafes and shops. Throughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to anyone able to manage the ladder. Would happily stay again."
2017-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Aika,We were lucky to get the room last minute as we had a change of plans when we arrived in Sydney so it was a perfect place for us to stay for the night. Communication went really well! The room is nice and bathroom is super clean (so important for me:)) Thank you Angela!
2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,16549021,Edmund,"Rob's place is situated close to the beach, take away store and a golf club - making it extremely convenient to travel around cronulla. 

There was plenty of space and the place was neat and tidy. The house was a little hot (it was a >30 degree weekend) but Rob did provide a number of fans to ease the heat discomfort."

2017-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,17967409,Tom,"Helen & Mike are the perfect host. Their home is beautiful, their company fantastic and the overall service is the best I have received in Australia outside of a hotel setting. I honestly can not recommend them higher, they really are great people! Thanks so much, Tom. "
2018-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Sandy,"We loved our stay in Studio 32.  The decor is very smart and comfortable, the location is handy to shops, restaurants, a cinema, public transport and a couple of nice parks - a tiny one at the bottom of the street and larger, Petersham Park, less than 10 minutes walk away.  Basic provisions, local information, and small, thoughtful extras made it a very comfortable location for our weekend in Sydney.  We'll happily return when next in Sydney!"
2017-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,10423504,Lorraine,"This accommodation is in a lovely location, quiet close to the beach. There was some miscommunication at the beginning, but Cat was exceptional in communication and sorting matters out straight away. 
The accommodation was very rustic with all mod cons, but in need of some refurbishment with the kitchen, which is due to be done after our visit. 
The location is easy to get into Sydney central with good transport links. It's also close to the stadiums and Bondi Junction shopping centre.
I would recommend this property for a relaxed stay. Thank you Cat!"

2015-05-09T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Eileen,"Nicole has an amazing apartment. Well designed, cozy and fully equipped. The bed was very comfortable that we almost didn't want to wake every morning! It's centrally located near the Central station so it's a plus if you are on public transport though the area could get pretty quiet at night. Sweet little touches like a lolly bowl and chocolates near your bedside table made us feel welcome. Nicole was also very prompt in replying our messages. Great host and place!"
2018-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,5116907,Laura,"This place was everything we expected and more! Anthony was an amazing host, accommodating our early check in. The place was left super clean and tidy and had everything we needed not to mention the complimentary wine/chocolate. Location was amazing with a short walk to bondi and 20min Uber to airport (Sunday). The ease of checkin/check out and communication throughout our stay was impeccable. We loved staying at Anthony's place in Bondi and would definitely love to stay again one day"

The room looked exactly as pictured, I found it to be clean and comfortable.  It was in a quiet neighbourhood, close to Avalon beach and overall a very pleasant stay. Thank you Cathy."

2018-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,22295401,Nico,Great spot for a short trip to Sydney. Very close to public transport and great food options all around Darlinghurst and Potts Point. Griffin was an excellent host and we really enjoyed our stay in his nice little apartment.

I enjoyed the stay and would recommend especially for people who are looking for an easy location."
2017-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Kim,"David was very easy to communicate with and he offered information about the area. He left a few things in the fridge for us, which we really appreciated. 
We stayed 3 nights over New Year's Eve and spent much of our time walking and visiting the city so the small apartment was fine for us and our 2 grown daughters. It would be perfect for a couple. It was hot, even with the windows open at night and the ceiling fans running.  Renters should be aware that this is a very noisy neighborhood and there are several ""adult"" type businesses up the street. Not great if you are travelling with small kids.
We did have trouble sleeping with the street noise.  

I would recommend David's place. It's situated less than 2km from the Circular Quay and Opera House, a perfect distance for a nice walk."
2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Adam,Mohit was so accommodating and we had an excellent stay.
2017-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Kate,"Great central location. So easy to get to. We walked all weekend all around the city. View from balcony seemed even better than the pictures! Good beds , linen & fluffy towels. We wished we had another day so we had time to use the pool, spa & sauna. All in all a great place to stay"

2016-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Edmund,"Victoria was at the studio apt to greet us, show us where everything was and to give us advice on finding our way around Sydney. She was very pleasant and helpful.  The apt was very clean, had all we needed and was easily accessible to the CBD, the Opera House and harbour. Lots of restaurants, cafes, shops close by plus a food market right across the street.   A very nice and secure building.
"
2018-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,26430039,Rebecca,Wonderful hosting. Accommodation as advertised - such a lovely part of the world! But the real stand out was the helpfulness and hospitality of hostess. She did everything to make it comfortable and easy with food and nibbles and drinks so that the first night. / morning could be relaxing and worry free.
2018-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,23357535,Gabby,The place was great and right in center city so walkable to many main areas!

2018-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,20906942,Fanfan,Thanks for having us Xinhue however I wasn’t really pleased with the stay. There is only 1 bed and a fold out couch that is claimed to be a bed but really isn’t. There’s bugs in the shower and a hotel is cheaper. Wish I had a better experience but I didn’t.. The place is smaller than expected too... Thanks for preparing the rooms though.
2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Zachary,Margaret was very easy going and accommodating.

2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,21999107,Betsy,"A very tasteful apartment with a tropical outlook. Everything you would need is supplied and it is a magical location with gorgeous homes along the way when you walk from the ferry and water front.
The most lovely small beach on Camp Cove is also just around the corner. 
This place is an oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city and you just need to jump on the ferry a short walk to reach many of the destinations on offer in Sydney.
Thank you again to both Jane and Neil we appreciated the thoughtful attention to detail  and the privacy you provided with the feeling that you were both very approachable if we needed anything."
2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Dominic,"Great stay, thanks Rhonda!"
2015-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Dominic,"Exactly what it said it would be and more. Really lovely private space in the garden of a family home. 10 minutes from the beach (up a steep hill) but a lovely walk and fantastic beach so well worth it. 

Susan and her family were the best Airbnb hosts we've had. Around just enough to give exactly the right amount of support that we needed without being too much. But also going above and beyond the call of duty bringing gorgeous breakfast food and even helping us with a bit of washing for our 8 week old baby which was so so helpful. 

Overall it was a really lovely experience with great people. Highly recommended. We'll be back for sure!"
2016-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Sharon,Great location and cozy flat. Parking is a great bonus especially int he city. The apartment was clean and check in was flexible and easy. Would definitely recommend for anyone wanting a place in city that has parking and is close to public transport. Central station is less then a 5 min walk and so many fantastic cafes close to the apartment. Great stay.

Clean and has all of the amenities you need if you don’t care to go out. If I come back to the Bondi Beach area, I will be looking to book Mal’s place again."

2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,6046461,Jerzy,"Lovely place in a beautiful neighbourhood, close to the waterfront and within a walking distance to most Sydney attractions. Subway is 3 minutes away.
Although I've seen pictures of Suzie's place it surpassed my expectations. Beautiful furniture, a mix of modern and Asian - style. Super clean and with all the conveniences you might think of. Very (!) comfortable bed.
And most important: Suzie, my host. My superhost. I already miss our discussions about Australia, world politics and ... life. I'd like to come back one day."
2015-08-16T04:00:00.000Z,7667264,Simon,"Unfortunately Isabella was not there so we never actually met, but the room was very cosy and the location beautiful, right in front of a picturesque park in Newtown and a very short walking distance to the main street with an almost endless choice of great bars, restaurants and cafes, would definitly stay here again :)"
2014-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Kerry,"The apartment was very roomy, great position and comfortable. The new kitchen makes it totally self contained and the sunroom was a delightful bedroom for our daughter.  Lovely decor throughout. Bernadette and Fred were so helpful and willing to please. Short drive to the airport was a bonus for us. Will definitely keep it mind for the future."
2016-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,13442098,Sonali,"Nicole was extremely flexible when it came to check in and out times which we appreciated very much. The apparment was meticulous and well equipped.

The house is situated in a  small and quiet street which is situated in the heart of beautiful Darlinghurst. A lot of restaurants, cafés and shops around and parks in food distance. I can recommend Davids place 100%!
Thanks one more time David!"
2016-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,南希,"Bryan is a really nice host. We can feel his love in the house. There are essential appliance and stuff prepared in the house. So people arrived in a rush can have a rest before buy anything. And the environment is really nice. People can have a walk along the bay. The public transportation is also convenient. The central is about 30 minutes bus away. If I will travel in Sydney again, I may choose Bryan's house again:) My friend and I had a really nice experience here."

Excellent location - close to shops and beach, and easy street parking.
Lovely hosts.  Thank you!"

The immediate area was not so good for food shopping but we always managed to get what we needed in the CBD before returning each day. Bus journeys in and out were easily negotiated.
Thank you Louise for making us so welcome!"

2016-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Lorraine,A really cool place to stay. Very vibrant neighborhood. Train from airport to Central and then a short walk to apartment. Not huge but way bigger and more comfortable than a hotel room. Hosts were very accommodating and allowed us to leave luggage til mid afternoon on day of departure.  Highly recommend this place.
2018-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,23357535,Gareth,"Excellent location, with great communication from the host and a very easy self check in process. Bed was comfortable, and apartment was warm and nicely decorated. Shower pressure is excellent, but hot/cold taps can be a little tricky to balance for shower temperature. Very good value, highly recommend."
2014-12-23T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Stephanie,Beautiful home in a great location. 5 minute walk to tons of cafes and restaurants and 5 minute walk to the beach. Family is very nice. They leave the front door totally open a lot of the time so if you are paranoid or untrusting with your things just be aware! But seems like a great neighborhood and we were not worried about our things. Some bugs like cockroaches but apparently this is normal for the area. Room was big and spacious with a tv and lots of closet space! Access to beach chairs was nice. Very good experience with lovely people.
2019-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Karol,They are real super hosts everything was perfect. We could even leave our bags there before chech in. Food was amazing. So was the space. We are looking forward to staying again soon.

2016-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,9759372,Kristian,The room was bright and airy. The location was only a couple of streets from King St in Newtown and was very close to cafes and train stations. The house was clean and well maintained and the housemates were friendly and welcoming.  All in all a good location and a great little place to stay.
2017-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Deborah,"A lovely property in a great location - 1 block to Spit Junction with all the amenities, transport and shops.  Lovely strolling in Mosman shops and the Providores for high end deli, fruit, bread just around the corner.  Fitness First and the Pool also 1 block away.  The property is very comfortable and stylish.  Rachel is a great host."

2018-03-12T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Rebecca,"The Magical Manly Earthquake Experience.
We woke each morning in our comfortable bed singing lines from classic tunes like ""Shake, rattle and roll"" or ""I feel the earth move under my feet"".
If you like an early start, vibrating beds, mirrors, windows, loud noise and a front row seat to view earthmoving and construction machines in action then this is the place for you!
Each morning the show begins at 7AM right outside your kitchen and bathroom windows and continues until 4PM. You will see the amazing performance up close. A large sandpit next door with a huge grey silo in the middle vibrating and spewing out cement dust like a beautiful smoke machine. Enjoy watching the excavators, cement trucks and hard hat wearing performers as they do their thing. As you are so close to the action, the sound quality is excellent - it is very loud. You'll need to book soon as work has already started and this experience may only last until 2020.

The manager/owner of the apartment did not warn us about this exciting daily event happening next door. As you can imagine it was a wonderful surprise for our tired family and really lifted our spirits after a long flight, taxi and ferry ride!

On a serious note, you will want to get out of the apartment early each day and start exploring the beautiful area of Manly and other parts of Sydney. It was a real bonus to return each evening to find our apartment building was still standing, had stopped vibrating and the noise had ended.

If you are still reading and are seriously considering staying at this place then there's something wrong with you but please, read on. The sheets and towels seem clean but the cleaners would benefit from attending vacuum, sweeping and dusting courses. The key pickup location is not secure. The apartment was older but spacious with high ceilings and a few cracks in the walls (not sure if this was caused by the current earth works/construction work).
Good times and memories that will last forever!"

Gwen was extremely communicative, and left us some great tips for things to see and do in the area.  I wish we could have stayed longer!"
2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,17438054,Ashley,This Granny flat is wonderful.  So many nice amenities are included.  We really enjoyed our 18 days there.  George and Lucia are great hosts.  We give them our highest rating - 5 STARS!

2017-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Jessica,Very easy to get in and out and close to the airport but about 20 minutes from the city without traffic. Spacious room and nice bathroom
2017-11-05T04:00:00.000Z,2838442,Roshan,"Rhonda was an incredibly kind and thoughtful host. She went the extra mile to ensure I was well looked after and was comfortable with my stay. I had an early departure flight and was up at 4am, but so was Rhonda as there was a power cut in the night in Sydney and she was concerned that my alarm clock may have reset! Very thoughtful.. Her home and the sleep out with great privacy for us guests was nice and spacious, very well maintained, nicely scented and very comfortable. Gymea is a great wee part of Sydney with good vibes, great people and offers a side of Sydney very different if travellers have only encountered the commercialness of the CBD/Darling Harbour etc. This was one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed at and will continue to use each time I attend transformative workshops in Gymea - Thanks Rhonda!"
2015-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,4138110,Lara,"Nice little apartment half an hour away from Sydney. It's a good place to stay at if you're in Sydney for longer, but wouldn't recommend it for a shorter time. "

La ubicación del departamento es excelente, tiene cerca varias paradas de buses y la estación del tren, también esta rodeado de excelente restaurantes y cafés. El departamento es increíble y aunque nos vimos poco con Naveen y Tristan siempre nos hicieron sentir como en casa, Felix salía a despedirnos todos los días y siempre nos recibía de la mejor manera, es un perro muy simpático.  "
2019-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,24858356,Rob,Outstanding location. Was a real treat to experience Bondi Beach this way. Highly recommend.
2016-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Susu,"Bailey was a great host! 
He responded immediately to the reservation and got us out of a sticky situation! 
The house is absolutely amazing! Has beach acess and the best view of Pittwater! We had the best backdrop and wedding photos! 
The house is super clean! Modern and comfortable beds. The 4 levels and total of 14 bedroom just gave everyone that extra room to breath and space to move! 
We will definitely be back! "
2015-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,888107,Olivier,"Wyatt was a friendly, accommodating and generous host, he even helped us with our laundry even though he had many things to do. The small bedroom is a bit tight for a couple but was as described in Wyatt's listing so we expected that, but it had a comfy bed and clean bedding. The house itself is indeed charming and cool, and located in a good, central suburb and you can bus down to CBD within half hour max, so that was great.

We really enjoyed Wyatt's company and found him a great host, thanks Wyatt."
2016-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Dennis,Our stay at Rachel's Mosman home was great.  The location is ideal and the home has a ton of character.  The kitchen is modern.

2018-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Kandise,"The unit is immaculately clean and tidy and in a fantastic location - just 8 minutes walk to the ferry at North Sydney or Milson's Point station in the other direction - or you can walk the bridge if the weather is nice.  The unit is small but we LOVED it, and I would definitely recommend it for a couple or two friends.  Millie was great with communication and access to the unit was easy.  Thanks Millie for making our stay so enjoyable and comfortable!"

2019-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,21939239,Jovana,"This a great studio in an excellent location. There is a washer and dryer that's very convenient for travel, and all the basics in the kitchen for cooking. I'd say it's easily big enough for 1-2 people. My fiance and I stayed here for a week together and loved it. We really fell in love with the neighborhood while we were there. Surry Hills is such a cute neighborhood with a bunch of delicious restaurants nearby. This apartment is very close to a couple of great bakeries and a gelato shop that we frequented often. There are also multiple grocery stores of varying sizes within walking distance (5-10 minutes). It's right next to a park that's great to relax at. There are a couple of bus stops that are a 2-5 minute walk away, and Central station (train and bus stop) is only a 10 minute walk away. We didn't have a car and only used the buses to get around, and it worked out really well. It is only about a 15 minute bus ride to the downtown Sydney area with the Opera House, and a very scenic (over the bridge) 45 minute bus ride to the zoo. We really enjoyed our trip to Sydney, and would recommend this apartment to others if they plan to visit."
2016-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Nicola,"We had a lovely time staying with Susan and Greg. They made us feel so welcome, introducing the apartment thoroughly and the local area too. They even helped us with local taxis and arranged a travel cot for our little one.

The apartment has great links, with amazing walks to Bronte, Bondi and Coogee. We ate in Susan and Gregs wonderful oasis garden one evening and in local restaurants.

The apartment was very clean, practical and just like the description.

Would definitely recommend this place! "
2019-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,22337456,Hollie,The apartment is near the supermarket and the cafe
2015-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Natasha,"Very comfortable room and Cathy had really thought of everything.  The coffee, yoghurt, fruit and fresh cut flowers were lovely.  Cathy was a very welcoming host.  We hope to stay again in the future."
2016-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Frances,"Hernan made sure I could access the keys as he was going out, he was very friendly and welcoming, told me to make a cup of tea if I liked etc. the room was nice and clean, the area is very good, and Hernan seemed like a very nice guy but we were both very busy , so only met briefly twice.  The location is easy walking distance to a lot of nice cafes and restaurants in Brighton, and bus routes to other areas. All up, the room was perfect for my visit."
2018-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Adam,We really enjoyed our time in Sydney. The accommodation was ideally located and exactly as described. We found the accommodation no problem with a 20 minute ride from the airport. An easy 15 minutes walk to the ferry terminal and The Rocks. Thanks again Oriel!

2015-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Pip,Susan has a cute little terrace house in a neighbourhood with many Italians in Sydney. We had our own bathroom in the garden studio and it was very clean and comfortable. Susan is a really relaxed host. We were well looked after.
2015-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Zaza,"Luke and Paul's flat listing caught my eye instantly, and we eagerly booked it as soon as we found that our desired dates were free. 
The flat looks exactly as it is pictured, and Paul was very responsive to our queries. 
While the neighborhood is quite close to the Kings Cross area (which we were told to be careful of), the Potts Point area where the flat is located is safe, and has a few good restaurants for a quick bite or a full meal. 
Paul had several restaurant recommendations which we tried, and we were not disappointed. 
While it is not entirely Paul's fault nor his liking, the apartment building does not have a lift, which made it hard for us to transfer our heavy luggage. However, the space of the flat itself is just right for three travelers, and we had a comfortable stay. I liked how the kitchen is well equipped as well. There extra towels and linens were a plus too. We stayed over the weekend and was able to catch the weekend market just across the street. We enjoyed that as well. We would definitely stay in Paul's flat again if given the chance. "
2016-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Kate,Hernan was really friendly and made us feel at home right away. He was really informative and had all the information leaflets to hand about excursions and public transport.
2014-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Stephen,"My girlfriend has been wanting to stay at Cath's place for quite some time now so she was quite pleased that we were able to book our last few nights in marrickville. Cath is an excellent host and a very thoughtful one as well! She welcomed us with a generous breakfast basket and with freshly baked bread the next morning! She was very organised and had all the need to know information all sorted into a little file with all the maps, delivery menus etc. The location is great just about 15 mins away from the domestic airport and about 25 mins away from the international airport. Our favourite airbnb stay so far!"

2016-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Kuan,Excellent neighbourhood to live like a local and explore the city. Didn't get to meet Miss D but her communication was prompt and that's very important for a traveller.
2016-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Victoria,"The Garden Studio is a lovely, comfortable, and beautiful place to stay at, and we would be more than happy to come and stay here again. Cath was very lovely, accommodating, and understanding. We highly recommend her place to everyone. The place was very clean and there were milk, eggs, and a breakfast hamper when we arrived, plus fresh bread in the morning which was a lovely thing to wake up to. The kitchen and bathroom were kitted out with everything that a traveller ever needs plus more. We also loved that it was near a few train stations and bus stops, and it's just a pleasant walk to lively Newtown. Thanks again Cath for having us and for being so understanding! We couldn't rate your place highly enough, if we could give it 10 out of 5 stars we would! :)

Less than 2 km from the Opera House and Circular Quay.  Secure building.  All in all, this is a nice property.  We had a question about the wi-fi and Andrea responded promptly, which we appreciated!"
2017-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Meyappan,"Mohit is a great host, and has a lovely home. It's a nice well furnished 2 story apartment. He even had netflix which helped us while the time at home.
It's a suitable place for couple and families with grown up kids. Not too suitable with families with young kids as the train station was quite a distance away. With 2 young kids and my parents, it proved a bit of a challenge to walk to and fro everyday."

They let us use the washing machine as we desperately needed it after a week on the road. The bathroom is super clean and spacious. Their place is very close to the bus stops. We also enjoyed a 15 mins walk to Newtown, a very funky neighbourhood with lots of cafes and bars. We would recommend staying at their place."
2015-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Jojo,"Staying at the apartment in Surry Hills was such a great experience! It was well stocked with everything you would need, including a great pantry of seasonings! We LOVED having the Nespresso Maker as well!!! The bed was very comfortable and the shower head was like being under a waterfall!!!!!! The building itself was amazing and the rooftop views were beautiful, especially at sunset! Not to mention the awesome pool!!! Everything about the Surry Hills apartment was amazing, from brekkies on the balcony to evenings on the most comfortable couch in the world! Also the little details like the advent calendar with little chocolates in it and the bowl of yummy candies to munch on! Thanks for a great stay Nicole and Simon!"

2016-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Melisa,David was a wonderful host. My family and I were welcomed kindly in front of the apartment. The place was extremely clean and had everything we needed. The location was walking distance to many tourist locations or a quick bus/taxi ride away. We'll definitely recommend this location to family and friends who plan to travel to Sydney.
2017-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,16609607,Sarah,"Great location, a quiet and private unit with very good air conditioning"
2014-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Kat,"Susan was a lovely host. The cabin is adorable, and nicely separate from the house. There was plenty of fruit, nuts, juice, and tea for breakfast, and although the bread was running low the first morning, Susan was quick to let us know that evening that she'd bought some delicious bread for the next day (without us having to ask or anything). As I was staying with a vegan friend and a gluten-free/lactose-free friend, the food options were really great.

At one point one of my travelling companions had an allergic reaction to her cat, and on the way out, we casually asked if she might have some Telfast or something similar, and she was more than happy to provide that. And in a sudden rainstorm, she equipped us with two umbrellas to ensure that we got to our destination only partially soaking wet.

All in all, we had a lovely stay, and would not hesitate to stay here again. "

There are a lot of stairs if that bothers you, and no AC. The street is quiet and a very short walk to shops, restaurants, beaches, pools, boutiques and some of the best walking paths (in the world?)."
2014-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Dominik,"Hernan was a really nice and easy going guy. Arrived around noon and directly got the keys for the front door and apartment, so I was really flexible.

Thanks again for your great hospitality Hernan!"

Had old bedsheets that someone had just slept in. Dust everywhere, toilet was filthy and when I asked where the towels where he said didn't I bring my own. Said I was fussy because I liked things a certain way. My last night bought me a towel but I had already gone and bought one because first night I had to use a hand towel to shower with. It was freezing with no heating. Really disappointed as I needed a place to chill as I had a few busy days of work in sydney but this made me feel really unsettled and yuck. I told him how air bnb works and he didn't see interested and just kept saying I was fussy. I had someone's cup on the bedside table and yeh it just wasn't great at all. But again nice bloke bad host. "

And it is true - it is 5 star location place - it is walk away from Hide Park, Opera House, Harbour Bridge, Royal Botanic Garden. I would definitely recommend Jessica´s place. "
2018-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Rhys,"Great place, awesome location. Clean, cozy and comfortable. would recommend to anyone. Alexey was very communicative and helpful. 10/10"

Great to have my own private bathroom and room next to it.  Amenities exceeded my expectations.  Felt thoroughly safe with lockable door, secure entrance and internal monitoring by hosts."

2014-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Lauren,"Had a lovely stay at Cath's Garden Studio. We chose the studio following the excellent reviews. The place was very comfortable and suited our needs perfectly. The breakfast was the highlight, including fresh croissants and bread. Would definitely return. Thanks!"

2018-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Luke,View of the beach. Right across from Icebergs. Sytlish. Clean. Well-priced. And a wonderful host with Anita. One of my favorite stays in Bondi. Planning to stay here again.
2015-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Andrew,"David's place is an adorable fully renovated Victorian double story shop front/terrace with all the mod cons. It is so incredibly central making for a quick walk to all the best Cafes and restaurants in Surry Hills. The location was perfect for me as I was in Sydney on business so was able to schedule a lot of my business meetings over coffee - David's location subsequently made my time very efficient. Upon arrival David provided clear instructions on the house amenities. He graciously provided a bottle of red wine (which I didn't drink but the thought was very much appreciated). We didn't see a lot of each other due to our busy work schedules. I unfortunately left my wallet at David's when I was in  rush to leave so he offered to post this to me in Victoria. 
His house is spotlessly clean and I loved having cable tv available in the room when I just wanted to chill out for a while. The house is located behind busy Taylor square but it get like it was locked away in a private suburb - there was no evidence of any street noise at all. A little oasis in a very busy intersection of Oxford and Flinders st. I look forward to having the chance to stay with David again in future. "
2015-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Jacobi,"Although I didn't meet my host face to face, I immediately felt welcome with instructions for getting into the house and amenities for cooking etc. 

Everything was exactly as advertised. This place is very easy to find in  a lovely neighborhood (yoga studio right around the corner, if you're into that!) and the most convenient walk to the train station. 

It was very clean. If you're looking for a calm, quiet, and easy place to stay, this is it. I'd definitely recommend it."
2018-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Natalie,"Home from home, beautifully presented room in a peaceful location. Cathy was a efficient hostess, warm and welcoming. We only got to spend one night here when attending a wedding at Whale beach; just wish we had longer! Thank you for having us!"
2016-09-20T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Loy,"Amazing place to stay if you are visiting Sydney, the location was amazing and easily accessible. The place was really clean and well taken care of. The host was really friendly and welcoming and attends to your needs"

2018-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Lisa,"This is a special unit.  The details of rich, beautiful fabrics, cozy blankets, lovely decor, not cluttered and simply stunning. The outdoor space was a great place to eat even though it rained quite a bit.  The heating element outside kept us warm and there are lots of throws and blankets if you need more.  The fridge had champagne, a gorgeous cheese plate, yogurt, fruit, milk (all our choices), crackers and more. This was in the top 2 airbnb's I've stayed in (and I am a veteran!). The walk into Avalon village was easily done via a pathway, just a few minutes away. The unit is quiet with blackout shades on every window. You will be very pleased with your choice. "
2017-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,10091713,James,"Bens apartment is in a great location in Sydney close to great restaurants, museums, bars and shopping - Everything you need. Ben was also very friendly,  helpful and communicative. We would highly recommend ! "

2016-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Boni,"Natasa was a wonderful host! I felt so welcomed. The room was lovely and bright and its a sweet neighbourhood, close to trains, cafes and pubs. Would recommend. "
2017-05-14T04:00:00.000Z,16020247,Tory,"Kassandra's place was perfect and easily slept the 6 of us! It was bigger than the pictures made out! We could easily walk to Newtown and we were a 2 minute drive to the Marrickville metro shopping centre, which made it easy to grocery shop. Kassandra was so lovely and welcoming. Such a lovely spot! I'm jealous! "
2018-05-21T04:00:00.000Z,24413268,Lizzy,Place was great but if you need to get a hold of the host for any reason at all you were screwed. Messaged them the first night of my week long trip there and never heard from them. Luckily it wasn’t anything majorly important but had to go buy my own towels.
2018-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,7439246,Cathal,We had a great stay at Nathan's place. Ideal location and good communication. Would happily stay again
2019-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,19574869,Madeline,"Une vue magnifique, des personnes adorables et réactives, de bons conseils, une belle déco, du confort, parfait ! L'appartement est un peu excentré mais très bien desservi, un avantage pour s'évader de cette grande ville de Sydney dans un cadre super zen. Top !"
2016-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Johnson,"It was great to meet Angela and be welcomed into her lovely home.  While it's not close to the city center (about 45 mins away via public transit), it's definitely close to the Airport (15 mins away) and the beach (5-10 min walk).  Uber or taxi is definitely the best way to reach this place from the airport though public transit can be an option if you have a lot of time.

Bring your strong arms as you have to take your luggage up to the third floor as they don't have a lift.  But, once you reach to her unit, you'll be rewarded with a great retreat.  The house is very clean and the room was spacious.  There's a big window besides the bed that brings in lots of natural light and there's even a TV in the room! Angela wasn't home the evening we stayed so we weren't able to converse more.  But all in all, my family and I had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay."
2016-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Karl,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The house is great and you have everything that you need. Bus station is just 1 minute away and you get to the city or to the famous beaches!
When we come back to sydney i stay in that house again! "
2016-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Kay Yong,Great location to stay in Sydney. A few minutes walk to Kings Cross Station which is just 2 stops away from Bondi Junction and Town Hall. Lots of food options around the area. Paul was very prompt and polite to us.

2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,19270950,Bru,Nice clean apartment in a secure building. Close to the shops and the city. Great for extended stays. Hosts are very responsive and even gave us an early check in.

2019-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,19508741,Sheena,"This is an attractive, comfortable and spacious place, with a welcome outdoor terrace and sitting area. The rooms are large and comfortable, and the breakfast supplies are a bonus. Highly recommended as a base to explore the northern beaches."
2015-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Catherine,"We stay in Linda's cosy house for 5 nights! Linda is very kind who prepare many food for our stay! The location of the house is close to Sydney's attractions and only 5 minutes walk to the train station! Linda is helpful to our problems in Wifi and TV! The only things need to concern is you may feel a little bit hot for the third people who sleep on the sofa at night, but you can turn on the fan or cooler if you want! Thanks Linda!"

2018-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,16408272,Luci And Ruben,"Chloe's apartment was very convenient for us as it is in a great location. You can easily walk to Circular Quay, The Rocks, Darling Harbour etc if that's what you are in Sydney for. The beds were very comfortable. Chloe was a very good host, very flexible and accomodating. Would highly recommend staying here."
2017-03-13T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Don,Thank you David for being such a wonderful host. Got me settled in pretty quick and was helpful in answering my queries promptly
2018-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,21127680,Guilherme,"Pontos positivos:
Localização excelente no centro, perto de parada de ônibus e de metrô, mercado grande, restaurantes, bares, no centro de Sydney. 
Apartamento grande de um quarto  e tudo novo, com varanda. 
Muito bem equipado (forno, fogão, geladeira, máquina de lavar roupa, máquina de secar, chaleira, torradeira, micro-ondas, mesa na sala com cadeiras, dois sofás, TV, cama muito confortável no quarto, ótimo chuveiro). Comodidades interessantes (shampoo, condicionador, sabonete líquido de banho, papéis higiênicos, detergente, secador, etc). 
Coffee é muito prestativo, responde no chat do airbnb muito rapidamente sempre. Check in e check out ocorreram perfeitamente. 
Pontos a melhorar:
Aquecedor não estava funcionando durante a minha estadia. 
Tampa da banheira era pequena e não segurava a água, portanto não conseguimos utilizar ela. 
Sofá cama para a terceira pessoa é desconfortável, o colchão é bem fino (uns 5cm de altura), fica a sugestão de, futuramente, trocar por um sofá cama mais confortável."
2016-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Colin,The house is spacious and in a great location. The two terraces are a lovely way to spend an evening with a bottle of wine. Jeremy is a very responsive host and fixed a couple of very minor things (bulbs out) we asked for straight away and with minimal fuss. There is no air con which means the house gets very hot in the warm weather.
2017-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Rose,"Anita was an absolutely wonderful host, and her place is simply beautiful. She has really put some thought into making the place special for her Airbnb guests. Every day I was just delighted to wake up to the cool summer breeze and gorgeous ocean view. You can see a good part of the ocean straight out the window, and it's really nice to see the sun, surf, swimmers and surfers out there having fun. Icebergs is just a couple of steps away and there is the stunning Bondi to Bronte right outside. It would also be a good writers retreat - I finished a first draft of my PhD dissertation here! The apartment has everything you need for a perfect holiday, and lots of thoughtful little touches everywhere. This is absolutely up there with the best Airbnb experience I've ever had. I would recommend it to everyone. I will be coming back as soon as I can! "
2017-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Chelsea,Good location. Nice accommodation. Hosts were very nice. Would recommend.
2018-08-04T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Akshata,Great location for any Olympic Park events. The apartment is spacious and has great views!
2018-08-04T04:00:00.000Z,26829659,Khoa,Amazing place and host!
2018-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,21999107,Paul,"Wonderful space in a great location. The apartment was spotlessly clean and very welcoming. Every light welcomed us when we arrived near midnight after an unpleasant flight and roadworks near the airport and it felt like we had found a quiet oasis after a hectic trip.

The supplied croissants, bread, wine, fruit, milk (and other things I have forgotten) were all great and helped us survive our early morning business meeting.

If you are coming to Watson's Bay, this place should definitely be on top of your list. We loved the village feel of the place, even though it is on the edge of Sydney and hosts a fairly major tourist attraction (The Gap). We are more than happy to recommend it.

Highlights:
1.  The food
2.  The garden outlook and sense of privacy
3.  The welcome provided to us by Neil, the host
4.  Proximity to spectacular locations and lovely walks

Problems:
The only thing that we could call a problem was that the Wifi kept dropping out BUT Neil specifically came to tell us about the problem and apologise and to tell us that a technician was coming out the next day to fix it. In other words, whilst the loss of Wifi was a little inconvenient, we cannot fault the response."
2015-07-12T04:00:00.000Z,5862093,Susan,"You get exactly what it says on the tin - with the addition of a most charming host. Kariem seemed willing to do almost anything to make my stay as perfect as possible. I was even taught how to make barista coffee, a serious bonus! 
I was concerned about the cold - but my room was warm and a wool underlay was provided for my bed (I don't like electric blankets), there was heating in the lounge. The apartment gets a good deal of natural sunlight.
I arrived very early in the morning, Kariem stayed home from work to welcome me and make sure I had everything I needed. He even offered to take me into the CBD when he went in.
I can fully recommend this. It is perfect for one person needing to be in this beautiful part of Sydney.
There is also great storage for your luggage and draws as well as hanging."
2017-10-16T04:00:00.000Z,18338274,Justine,"Great location, great for family, plenty of amenities and supplies provided and quick helpful host .  Would definitely stay again.
Book about property was great for advice as well as house information and history.
Thanks for a great stay"
2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Melodie,"Cushie was great. Good communication. The place is not the same as in photos. The place was not very well cleaned and the furnitures were old, from the 70s. The location is amazing though - real disconnection from the city. I would not recommend this place if you are after a bit of comfort. Ideal for a yoga retreat."
2019-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Hayley,"Thank you for such an amazing stay. We really enjoyed our time and it was everything we expected. Loved the apartment  and swimming pool was a plus. We only just realised a few days in that there was a bus stop right round the corner from us. This came in very handy. Close to the casino, close to shopping malls, close to a supermarket. Even had Netflix which made our time that much more enjoyable during our downtime. 20min walk to cbd and nearest train station. Only thing I could recommend is having a more powerful fan as we ended up sleeping with the sliding door open. I ended up getting bitten a few times. But other then that was an awesome stay. Thank you for being a lovely host."
2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z,20578419,Oosman,Overall great value and centrally located

2016-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Liam,"Very nice little studio apartment. Looks exactly like the pictures. We only saw Cath very briefly but she made the whole process very easy. Good selections of breakfast items and a great bathroom, lounge room is small but functional. This studio may not suit you if you're a light sleeper it has a lot of natural morning light and planes flying close by. Location is smack in the middle of 3 train lines all about 15mins walk away.
Not super close to the city center, but good if you have a car to park and don't want to pay.
Thanks for a good stay!"

It had everything we needed, and Nathan even added little extra touches, like the chocolates and soaps. The bus stop, right out the front, was very convenient, allowing us access to all areas of Sydney. It was also wonderful to spend the day sightseeing, and come back to Maroubra beach to relax. A fantastic spot. Thank you again Nathan, for your hospitality."

Very good communication with Mohit and his wife. They are really good and helpful. Definitely suggest you to stay there for holiday."
2018-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,24460520,Emily,"A great place to stay, clean, in a great location and very comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay again."
2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,22323221,Christine,"I stayed at Agata’s place for the first three weeks after I moved to Sydney, and I absolutely loved the apartment. It’s a self-contained apartment with a private entrance and a wonderful patio, which is particularly delightful during the Australian summer. The place felt very much like home right away, and it’s close to buses and local shops and restaurants. Buses take less than 30 minutes to the beach and the city, and UNSW and Randwick village are both within walking distance. The bed is comfortable and the TV has Netflix, while both the kitchen and bathroom is equipped with all the basics (such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, essential toiletries, washing powder, milk, oil, salt, pepper, etc.). Agata was a fabulous host: she was quick to respond to requests (such as replacing the bug spray when it ran out), and kindly received some mail for me too. I couldn’t have wished for a better place to start off my time in Sydney, and I highly recommend Agata’s place!"
2016-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Sandy,"Cath is a super host and fellow frequent traveler and this is very evident in the garden studio.  There are tons of personal touches and amenities that make you feel like you are staying at a very close friend's place.  If you forgot anything at home, she probably has it neatly tucked away in a corner of the studio.  We had a wonderful stay."
2018-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Tsen,"The place is really cozy, clean, and tidy. Self check-in is really easy and convenient. Check in anytime to a bedroom with ensuite and kitchenette was great for our last minute trip to Sydney.
The neighborhood was quiet, we had a good sleep."
2017-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Nongyao,ขอบคุณมากๆสำหรับการต้อนรับที่อบอุ่น
2017-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,13852692,Simon,"Wow. That is what every said when they entered the place - stylish, huge, and can easily take ten people without feeling crowded.  Indeed we had a dinner of 15+ people with takeaway from the local Thai and the rooms had a great vibe for that kind of relaxed get together. We could walk to North Sydney station or down to Mc Masons Point ferry to give lots of flexible access. A very good neighbourhood with good restaurants and walks by the harbour - put the place itself is in a very quiet street.  And Vanessa was wonderfully responsive to any small issues we had or advice that was needed.  A wonderful place for a large group."
2017-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Paula,Danny's 3 bedroom apartment was as describe on the website.  all of the necessary amenities were set up nicely.  the internet was hard to connect to unless in the bedrooms. but overall it was a great place to stay an in the best location.  Public transportation was very near and many sites to visit were within walking distance or by bus.  We enjoyed the ability to cook or go out to eat.  The apartment was stocked like home.  the availability of a washer and drying made it even more attractive.  Clean and set up great...
2018-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,9080393,Anthony,"Loved our stay and communication with Host Lina... thank you! Very quiet and clean space. The rooms and living area were bigger than expected, which was great. My dad and I stayed for the Ironman in Penrith, we needed and  good kitchen, relaxing space, quiet and clean... ALL were appreciated. Will stay next year :)"
2018-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,James,This apartment is in an amazing location with amazing views of manly beach. The apartment is spacious and beautifully styled. Would highly recommend
2013-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Akalya,"The garden studio was a wonderful little place in Marrickville, close to new cafes popular in Sydney!  Cath was a fantastic host and provided more than we expected. We'd recommend couples to stay for a little hideaway away from the hustle and bustle of the city!"
2018-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,20767798,Charles,"Jared's place is in a great location on the 6th floor of Bridge Street, in the heart of the city. He manages quite a few properties across the world, so we did not get to meet him personally. 

We took the train and got off at Circular Quay and walked about 10 minutes with our luggage. It was a great jump off point to catch the cruise ships, the Royal Botanical Gardens, and the Sydney Opera House. 

Ana, the local agent, had a limited schedule, but dropped off our keys at the apartment and was very communicative throughout the check-in and check-out process. The room was fit to sleep 6 adults and was spacious enough for my family. The place did smell of disinfectant and the carpet showed some signs of wear. 

Keep in mind that you are in the city, so train and traffic noise will be part of the experience. We  really enjoyed being in a centralised location. We would consider this place again for a future stay."
2016-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Realyn,"Shuang was on holidays during my trip which was well communicated beforehand, so my check in was with Fen. The place was exactly as described and pictured. It was very clean and has all the necessities for a comfortable stay. Was also conveniently located near Woolworths the supermarket and Wolli Creek train station which is surrounded by a few restaurants, cafe's and other small stores. Would definitely recommend Shuang's place.  "
2016-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Stephanie,Great house and location
2016-05-04T04:00:00.000Z,12117514,Dani,"Great location, lovely helpful hosts. "
2018-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Jinseung,위치가 정말 좋아요. 기차역과 시드니 오페라 하우스도 매우 가깝습니다.
2018-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Thomas,"Had trouble with the drainage in the shower, but told Jennifer who was quite responsive & cooperative, hopefully it will be fixed by the next occupants stay.
Bed wasn’t too comfortable but the room was nice."
2015-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Sebastiaan,"David was a very friendly host. The room suits all our needs: clean, comfortable bed and nice balcony. We recommand this place very much. Nice neighbourhood with lost of good restaurants. Thanks David for your hospitality."
2018-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,25684995,Kylie,Great apartment in a perfect location
2017-09-08T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Yu,"Close to train station, market and some restaurants. Walkable distance to Airport. Neighbors are a bit noisy but we did no better, either, because we can hear almost everything through the thin wall. The host are really nice."
2017-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,19574869,Sean,"Excellent location for those keen to walk around the local area, and there's plenty of bus routes nearby to get into Bondi junction and/or the city, lovely view and nice big deck.  Kitchen and bathroom could use a bit of updating, but otherwise a great spot."
2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,24608152,Peter,We had a great stay! Pool is lovely and apt is located in lovely area in northern Sydney. Definitely recommend!
2019-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Kylie,Good communication with our host. Gorgeous dog! Our only real issues were the traffic noise as this location is close to a busy thoroughfare and we stayed during a spell of hot weather and we found the pedestal fan not to be adequate. Good location in terms of close access to public transport.
2016-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Rowena And Jim,Susan was a lovely host. Very welcoming and friendly. The house was conveniently located and Susan gave me some great recommendations. The cabin was very comfortable and clean. Would definitely book again.
2019-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,17438054,Robert,G & L's place is a perfect place to rest up.
2015-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Philip,"Great stay with DJ! Place was in a great location, cool historic building from 1860's, very clean house, and DJ provided loads of amenities including an entire professional guide to the city, which I took full advantage of & had a blast doing so! Thanks again DJ for hosting in your perfect spot!!"
2017-03-12T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Moritz,Really close to the Harbour Bridge. Liked the clean and cosy room. Easy checkin/checkout. Would come again!
2018-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,20962081,Xiaoying,quite good!
2016-07-12T04:00:00.000Z,4499095,Melody,"The apartment is just like in the photos and there are 2 great cafes where you can get the famed aussie brekkies. Yums! Location is pretty good but avoid going through King's Cross station if you are coming back late. Instead, there is a bus (311) you can take from Central station that goes right to the door of the apartment. 

Only downside is that the birds/animals? nesting in trees in front of the bedroom can be noisy at night. Haven't figured out what they are since i always thought that birds sleep at night... But all in still a good stay!    

"
2018-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Zahra,"Really great place, I would highly recommend staying here. Alexey was a great host very communicative. The apartment had everything you could need and the location was great! "
2017-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Marie,"This is a very nice condo, location was awesome.  We walked everywhere and went to some of the restaurants Desiree recommended, we were not disappointed.  Had a great stay and most certainly would love to do it again. "
2018-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Matthew,Just be a where it will take you about 1 hr on the bus to get in to the Sydney Opera House
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,James,Angela’s place is absolutely wonderful - she has thought of absolutely everything. You are guaranteed a perfect time when you stay here!
2017-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,13302796,Chong,Great location. Inna privide many useful information.
2017-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Dean,"The place was close to the airport and the check-in was easy in that you could get in at odd hours. Very convenient if you need to stay the night and need to get to the airport early in the am. 

All the essentials were provided including an iron. You potentially need to share the bathroom and kitchen if there is another tenant in the next room. it didnt matter to me as i only stayed the night. 

Would stay again in the future if i was making a short stop in sydney."
2017-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,15745971,Tharit,It's a very very good place. The location is so good closed to the airport and there is the IGA supermarket at the door of the apartment. Clean and tidy place. All required equipments are provided including cooking and coffee stuff.
2017-09-08T04:00:00.000Z,16651655,Edward,"we needed a place to stay nearby due to an ill relative, ended up arriving 5hours after we intended but even at 1am Steven came out to greet us and give any assistance. We just needed a place to crash and it turned out to be quite convenient and close to what we needed access to. Would stay again!"
2018-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,19238057,Margaret,"Close to shops, public transport  and eateries!"

Review:
Ann was a thoughtful, generous  host with a sense of humour.  We had a freshly painted bedroom with heated king sized waterbed overlooking a marvellous garden by the river.  We stayed in bed until mid-morning. The buffet was enough food for the day!  She had local honey, home-made yoghurt and fruit and herbs fresh from the garden to make teas also top coffee.  Her house is packed with treasures and stories about the island and the Hawkesbury.  We'll be back!!
"
2018-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Annisa,"The place was enermous for the 3 of us, 
It's a new building so everything is clean and tidy
They even have the netflix

Bus station nearby, get to town in approx 20mins - 35mins, by uber to town cost 30aud"
2015-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,2900140,Laura,Anne's place was perfectly adequate for a one night stay in Newport although the place we stayed in is not the same as the photographs. We were also unsure which of the areas we could access as the flat is attached to the main house. But we appreciated the snacks that were left for us and the apartment was clean and tidy.
2019-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,21648821,怡帆,"很糟糕的入住体验,房间和位置还行,但是房东不负责任,没有及时回应,一共入住4天3晚,第一天买了一袋食物晚上烧,煤气灶头却坏了,跟房东反馈,房东说明天上午来检修,让我们用BBQ炉子,第二天等了一整天,没有任何人联系来修理,房东只说抱歉,却没有任何行动,要等到第三天才来修理,BBQ也没有液化气无法使用!房东也只会说不好意思,很不负责!房间里面 硕大的蟑螂有好几只看见,很可怕!"
2018-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Richard,Pretty much as advertised. Stunning view!! Lovely health cafe at the end of the road. Some nice walks. Just a really nice getaway for us.
2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Yik Rioli Barry,Very great location ! Will definitely stay here again!
2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,2889953,Eddie,Jyoti and Uttam were so lovely and accomodating. They were super helpful with travel tips and made me feel very welcome. My highest reccomendations for this Airbnb.
2018-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Lance,We are regulars and it is always a treat.
2016-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Sylvia,"We really loved our stay at Cathy's place. Location is very nice, close to everything but in a quiet surrounding. Cathy is a very nice lady who does everything she can to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Everything was very clean and she provided us with stuff for breakfast, towels.. Such a shame we had very bad weather. Perfect excuse to return one time :) We can really recommend Cathy's place! :)"
2018-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,16813942,Clare,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2018-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,5604994,Stephen,"Long story short: My original place that I booked for my vacation was a noshow so as a last minute booking, I could not have been happier. It is above a shopping complex but you don't get the noise of the shoppers as you're 5 floors up. It is next to a main bus terminal and eventually on a rail line, so you won't be too far from town. 

The hosts were super flexible and were always available, if needed. I know when I return to Sydney, I will be booking this place again."
2017-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Daisy & Rana,"Nice hosts, great location,"
2016-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Anna,"My family and I had a fantastic stay in Rachel's home. The house was beautiful and very clean. I chose this place because the photos looked amazing and it did not disappoint. I got ready for my wedding here and the house provided the perfect backdrop for our photos. 
The 2 main beds upstairs were large and comfortable. Very spacious bedrooms with lots of wardrobe space. The only draw back was that it didn't have enough curtains in one of the rooms so it became really bright and sunny early in the morning when we wanted to sleep in. The single bed downstairs was great. 
It was great having two toilets, one up stairs in the main bathroom and one downstairs in the laundry room next to the single room. That way we didn't have to go up and down the stairs for the toilet. 
Another draw back was that two of the steel chairs on the dining table were missing its seat cushion so I used the bar stool cushions but it may be time to replace them. Also, the 2 single sofa chair cushions were old and worn out. It was covered by a blanket so you couldn't tell, but when you sat on it, the cushion would slide off the sofa with you on it. 
We had everything that we needed like bath towels and extra blankets (the weather was cold during our stay). It was a 5 minute walk to the local shops and restaurants which was super handy. The garage provided was super handy too because street parking in Mosman fills up pretty quickly. 
I did not get to meet Rachel in person but we communicated via mobile phones. Thank you for allowing us to stay at your lovely home. "
2017-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Hannah,"Sarah's place was perfect for my event & her hospitality was beyond lovely. The neighbour kept leaf blowing which made the pool dirty but without me even asking the entire household went to so much effort to clean it before my guests arrived for the event despite having a broken cleaner! It was so sweet. The only thing that was a little tricky is that I didn't realise the private space did not have a kitchen, and the door kept falling off it's hinges. Luckily Sarah let me do my cooking in her family space so all was well. An amazing happy go-lucky host who deserves more appreciation! thank you so much! I hope to stay again :)"
2018-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Nicole,Great unit close to everything. We stayed several times and it’s great value for money in Manly

2018-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Parisa,"This location can't be beat, especially for the price! About two blocks from the ferries and walking distance to several sites, bars and restaurants. Communication was good also. Would definitely stay here again! "
2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,25977467,Carolin,"Gabbie helped us with the check-in and everything around the Airbnb. The place is more spacious as expected on the photos and the location is amazing - right by Darling harbour! Gabbie responded to queries very quickly, which was very helpful. Unfortunately the fridge wasn’t working properly, however she managed it super well and even got a new fridge within 1 day of telling her. Very impressed! I would highly recommend this place, the only thing which is a bit of a shame is the lack of natural light (as buildings are built so close to each other in Sydney) and the main bedroom faces the hallway within the building, however if you’re not planning to be indoors all day this is the place for you! Thanks Gabbie"
2019-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Michelle,"Nice beach escape! Lovely view to wake up to each morning.  Many areas to gather with the family. Might get a little hot in the summer tho, as there is no air-conditioning. But many fans provided. Place needs a little more maintenance but overall still cozy and nice. Good responsive host too."
2018-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,24858356,Rohan,Lovely host. Thanks for a great stay!
2019-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,12117514,Sarah,"Loved staying at Gwennaelles place! She couldn’t have been more responsive or given more local tips - so helpful! It was a short walk from the beach and I just enjoyed spending my time at Bondi. This area has a great vibe in the summer and has everything you need for a great getaway. The space is exactly as shown, comfortable, and with plenty of space."
2018-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,21648821,Kim,"A lovely apartment, great location and David and Cassandra made communication  super easy and were extremely prompt with responses.

Ein großartiger Ausgangspunkt, um aus zentraler Lage heraus Sydney zu erkunden. Nette und hilfsbereite Nachbarn, persönlicher Kontakt schnell möglich. Sehr schön und persönlich eingerichtet; man hat das Gefühl, bei Freunden zu Gast zu sein. Die Küche ist komplett eingerichtet, um selber zu kochen und sich wie zu Hause zu fühlen."
2018-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,22068048,Emma,"Lucy and Ralph were both very friendly, nice and easy to talk to. Such a nice, HUGE place to stay, and absolutely loved all the green in the gardens! Was very relaxing coming home to the waterfall going in the pond. 
Thank you so much for having myself and Jade whilst we were training for work. I highly recommend Lucy and Ralph’s home to anyone! "
2018-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Emily,"A nice little place, and a great location! We didn't have any troubles here and thoroughly enjoyed our stay :)"

2017-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,16549021,Celeste,Roberts Place was great for our whole family...house was clean and close enough for a stroll into Cronulla mall for coffee or food. Will defiantly stay again if the family heads back to Cronulla
2018-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,23106836,Liujeng,Perfect location and nice room
2015-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,5993432,Ellis,"Hugo was very friendly, the apartment has a lot of small thought out nice touches to make your stay more convenient.  
The listing is very accurate, what you see on the photo's is what you get. The building is old but not noisy and the bed very comfortable. Good location for getting around Sydney, would recommend staying here to any of our friends!"
2016-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Lana,"We stayed in the apartment for an even held at Qudods Bank Arena. It was the perfect location, we were able to duck out for a quick shop to the DFOs and a quick easy walk to our event. 
The apartment was excellent the beds were really comfy and having 2x bathrooms suited us well."
2015-08-03T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Rebecca,"Wayne and Kate were friendly hosts who remained easy to contact throughout our stay. The location of the apartment was fantastic - just across the road from Tamarama beach. You can hear the waves crashing on the beach as you fall asleep. We had some noisy neighbours on the Saturday night (that was obviously no fault of the hosts) but otherwise it was a very enjoyable stay. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking, and the apartment was comfortable for the 6 of us. We were lucky to have warm winter weather when we visited and thoroughly enjoyed the beach track walks to Bondi and Coogee. "
2015-11-07T05:00:00.000Z,6170899,Patricia,"Jennifer went over and above the call of duty in making us feel as though we were welcome guests in her beautiful property.  She left us wine, chocolates, milk and other provisions on arrival which were such a treat as we were too tired to go to the shops.  Jenny also took the time to explain the bus and ferry routes and gave us information about where to visit.  The property was most definitely a home and I appreciated that Jenny trusted us to stay in her home and to treat it with respect, which I hope we did.  It is an honour to have someone place so much trust in another person, especially as every item in the property was so obviously a much treasured possession.  I would love to stay at this property again at some time in the future."
2017-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Sharon,"Angela and Geoff were wonderful hosts, providing extra touches and attention to our needs. They really went out of their way! The communication was great and everything went smoothly. What a lovely space. The kids loved it. Thank you!"
2015-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Nelly,"Absolutely loved staying with Naveen! The room was incredible (even better in person), apartment was stunning and she went into every detail to make sure we had everything we could possibly need. Having our own bathroom was so convenient as well and the location was great - everything you could need was close by and the train station was a short walk. Naveen was also great help with transport & places to go and eat. Will definitely be staying again next time I'm in Sydney!"
2018-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Braeden,"This was my first AIRBNB Experience, I truly enjoyed the creative and functional space. Three balconies were incredible, great city skyline views. Very quiet building. It is close to the train station, but this does quiet down around 11pm every night. 

The place is warm, the heaters are warmer and the two guest bathrooms meant I could enjoy the privacy of my own space and visitors could use the one upstairs. 

The tv didn’t quite work with limited reception; but if you don’t want to watch television or sports the whole time you’re there - head on out and experience SYDNEY night life just a stone throw away and in some cases, right next door! If you want a cheap quick eat - dominos pizza is down stairs; that was great for a sobering up recovery with my parents who visited. 

For my first AIRBNB experience this house was exceptional and Alexey was very hospitable, I had planned on visiting with my partner but they broke up with me before I arrived from Melbourne. Alexey was very sweet leaving a bottle of wine for me and checking in on me to make sure I was okay. 

All in all an amazing experience."
2017-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,10423504,Anna,"Excellent stay at Bondi. All you can want in closeness to restaurants, the beach, busses and still have a secluded feel to it. The house had everything we needed and it was great for the kids also. We can highly recommend the house and the host Cat."

Don is a fantastic host who let us stay longer on the check out day as our flight was not until late evening. The place has everything you need and is super clean. Would definitely stay again in the future!
2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,16160263,Samantha,Really nice apartment in a great location close to Avalon beach. Photos don’t do it justice!
2016-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Felicia,"The accommodation was in a quiet location close to everything in Newtown. It was more of a hostel than we expected as the other rooms of the town house were also rented out via Airbnb. As we did not spend any time in the house apart from sleeping at night and showering in the mornings we never really met any of the other people staying there. The only negative bit would be that my sister was sleeping on a mattress on the floor and there was no top sheet for her and only bare blankets and no doona. When we asked for a top sheet as it feels fresher miss d said: ""why would you need that?"". When we arrived to the accommodation there was also an unwashed plate in the kitchen, which we got a message about the next day implying that we had left it. As we never had any breakfast at the accommodation but went out to eat it could not have been us. We did not reply to that message though as we felt it had nothing to do with us, and maybe the guest which left the plate had cleaned up after him or herself. 
I am sorry if we came across as rude guests asking for the top sheet and not replying to the message about the plate. But for guests coming in the future: if there is dishes left by other people, maybe just do them for the sake of peace or tell miss d immediately, and if you are more than two people staying in one room, you can maybe bring a set of travel sheets for the one not sleeping in the bed.
We never met miss d and only communicated via this app. The house was clean and if you just need somewhere close to sleep it is a good place to stay.
Kind regards"
2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,16651655,Tahmina,"Great place to stay and only about a 10 min walk to St Peter’s station, with a king st and Newtown just around the corner!"
2017-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,16602162,John,Fantastic views from this Unit overlooking Darling Harbour. Quick easy lift access. Looking forward to returning
2014-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,794910,Adrian,"Gavin was a very good host and helped us planning our stay. The room and all the facilities were clean and the bed was very comfortable. The location is a good starting point for the exploration of the whole of Sydney and with the detailed directions from Gavin, it's also easy to find. All in all we can only recommend the stay!"
2018-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,22412815,Caroline,Good location to Featherdale Wildlife Park and Blue Mountain.
2015-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Alex,"10/10. Fantastic apartment located right in the center of Sydney. Amazing views, full service amenities plus more, close to absolutely everything. Hugo was easy to deal with, welcoming, friendly, and very helpful. The listing details and photos are very accurate. The views of Hyde Park, Royal Botanical Gardens and the Sydney Harbour are lovely. The apartment was extremely clean and well kept; it had a cosy, warm, homestyle type of feel. A very refreshing place to retreat to after a day out. I found it much more private and comfortable compared to normal Sydney hotels and apartments. After staying for a few days I almost didn't want to go home. I'd highly recommend this apartment listing to anyone wishing to stay in Sydney whether it's your first time and you want to see all the tourist locations or even if you travel to Sydney regularly and just want a great place to check in to, like a home away from home. I'll definitely look at staying here again on my next trip to Sydney. Thankyou Hugu, your hosting is very much appreciated."
2017-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Tai,Marcella's place is very big and got lots of book. Near to the beach. But the floor is quite dirty and dust. We even need buy a mop to clean it by our own as we need to stay there for 4 days. Overall is great and nice.
2016-06-26T04:00:00.000Z,13302796,Eugene,"Great position, within walking distance of all the major CBD attractions and inner city suburbs like Darlinghurst, Surry Hills and Woolloomooloo. 

Our host was very friendly and thorough, and easy to deal with. 

The accomodation itself was fine - 5 beds (incl 3 doubles) in 3 bedrooms.  Awesome easterly view from the 13th floor. Perfect for a boys weekend. The fridge didn't work although I can't mark my host down for that as I didn't contact her to give her a chance to fix. "
2016-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,9223554,Mr B,"Wow... EXCELLENT indeed. From the moment I stepped in. I felt completely welcomed. The host is excellent, great and very respectful. Really excellent always. The host told me I have unlimited supply to towels. I felt home. I can use everything in the kitchen. Very clean. This is something you will notice. The place is really clean. Clear instruction.  I was offered to use the washing machine. There is a natural feeling of feeling comfy there. The area is great. It is close to Newtown walking distance. Few minutes from train station. 
Train is 5 to 10 minutes from Central station in Sydney. Once you're in Central station you're in the city and you can walk around. 
A++++ Would love to revisit someday. Excellent!"
2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,19508741,Mitch,"Top spot, and very hospitable hosts! We'll surely be back again"

2018-05-04T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Yvonne,"Absolutely fab location. Very central and a stones throw from darling harbour. Lovely large apartment, comfy beds and plenty of room. Would definitely use the apartment again if we get back to Sydney."
2018-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Reuben,Great location at great price with good communicating host
2018-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Laura,"Thank you so much Belinda for the stay in your lovely cottage. The space is perfect - clean, modern design, peppered with lovely vintage touches. We loved looking out the windows onto your lush garden and it was a treat to be so close to such a stunning beach. It's the ideal home base for exploring the Royal National Park. Hope to be back again!"
2018-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,22198157,Louise,"Duncan’s place offered the perfect family break for us. It’s very accessible from Sydney but gives the feeling of being far away from it all. The location is great being just a short drive from several beaches, shops, cafes etc. The house is incredibly well equipped with everything you can think of and the host went out of their way to provide helpful information and little touches which made us feel very at home. It’s a very sociable home with several eating and entertaining spots in the house: an upper balcony & bbq overlooking the treetops and ocean as well as a lower deck, dining table and bbq area downstairs. The garden is private and the pool area lovely for lounging around under a shady tree. We would have no hesitation recommending Duncan’s place."
2017-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,David,A great place to stay and enjoy the beaches and walks available in the Royal National Park. Its private and stylish with easy access to the local beaches and within walking distance to local shops and super market. Highly recommended.

2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,20767798,Emma,"The location was perfect for what we needed, with the apartment being clean, tidy and easy to access. 
Apartment came as described and communication with Ana was faultless. 
The mattresses were firmer than our personal taste, but linen and rooms were clean. 
Noise levels can vary, but not something the owner can prevent or control. 

Overall the apartment comes accurately described and located in a great area!"
2019-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Lara,"Great place. Stylish, great bathroom and bed and the kitchenette is perfect to make easy meals. A/c in summer a blessing as well."
2014-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Jonathan,Susan was a nice host and helpful in helping us with our sight seeing and transport.  The cabin is on it's own in the back yard which was nice for privacy. We were pleased with our stay.
2018-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,22295401,Chia Chen,"Griffin was an exceptional host with great hospitality. He was very welcoming and experienced with his explanations and tips. Really appreciate the aesthetically designed apartment with complementary condiments provided by Griffin! Overall, extremely pleased with Griffin, the apartment and it’s convenient location (very near the train station and surrounded by lots of food)! (: "
2016-07-29T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,정원,"Angela's house was very good. The room is clean and nice better than the pictures. And angela and her son were very kind! Nearby here, there is the brighton le sands beach. That was great also."
2012-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Dan,"Had a great stay with DJ even though it was only for a couple of nights, he was a very welcoming and considerate host. Definitely would recommend a stay there. "

2019-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,26340840,Danielle,A great property! The best furniture and layout for a family getaway! The location is awesome too with lots around!
2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,12655535,Ivan,"Great location, slightly old carpets and walls... No aircon is the main disadvantage considering the humid climate."
2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Laura,Such a great location for going to events in Olympic Park!
2017-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Jeremy,"Mal's place in central Bondi was perfect. A great location, just over the road from the beach and close to cafes, restaurants and bars and a clean and comfortable top floor apartment with a great view. Highly recommend."

2017-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,17028088,Emily,"A great place with absolutely amazing hosts! They left us food, directions for the whole house, and gave us rides to the train station. They were extremely welcoming and helpful. The place itself is spacious and comfortable, close by bus stops to all areas of Sydney. Right by a great park. Would recommend to anyone, we loved our stay! "
2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,16651655,Suzie,"A great place to stay if you are in need of last minute  or budget accommodation. Steve and Jesse are lovely and specifically came to introduce themselves to me after I arrived.  Parking on the street in the evening was fine and the location was convenient for me to get to roads that took me to the CBD, North Sydney and the Airport. 
As I was in Sydney on business, it would not be somewhere I would normally stay, but I found it safe and convenient. 
Thanks Steven and Jesse for your hospitality."
2015-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Ajay,"Cath is a superb, warm and friendly host and was quick to respond to any queries we had during the booking process. The studio is just like it is shown in the pics being even better than a hotel stay. It is fully equipped with everything you need and it has everything as described on the Airbnb site. We were blown away with the fresh and tasty eggs Cath provided us from her own chickens on site. Her breakfast hamper has fresh bread, yogurt, muesli, milk and other baked goods that was more than what we needed. Cath is very thoughtful and considerate of her guests and will provide you all the information required to travel, eat and be like a local which is what we wanted to do in our Sydney stay. We also loved her sense of style and the way she has done up the Garden studio. Also there is a lovely vegetable patch with herbs and greens right outside the studio. Very pretty.  The little details matter like the umbrellas, picnic basket, extra blankets, etc that were provided to us. The studio is not located within the CBD area but that was not a problem at all since we were commuting around via trains and buses and did not find any issues doing so. Also it is in a suburb very close to the central area so you are still pretty close. Besides Marickville has some of the best food and coffee options that we explored in our trip. Stay at the Garden studio and you will not be disappointed. We were sad to leave and only wished we could have stayed longer. This has surely been our best AirBnb stay till date. 

P.S. Just make sure you are okay to stay in a loft like bed with a movable ladder to climb up and down which may not suit everyone. That was a highlight for us though and we wanted to experience it :) "
2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Matt,"We had a great stay in Cathy’s studio - had everything we needed, nicely furnished & a cosy space.
Would recommend & stay again 
Cath was great to deal with"
2017-01-23T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Natalie,"This unit was perfect. Great size, brilliant location,  eateries close by, Darling Harbour just a stroll. Massive amount of storage and space in each room, comfy beds, great view. Would definitely stay there again."
2017-04-04T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Fernanda,"The apartment is confortable, spacious and well decorated. The bed is amazing and I loved the big windows with street views. Victoria was lovely. I was travelling with my husband, arriving from a 20 hour flight from Brazil and she let us check in earlier. We really appreciated it. The neighbourhood is charming and full of nice cafes and restaurants. We had breakfast at Zinc cafe everyday. I highly recommend the property and would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Vickie! "
2018-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,21851474,Andrea,Great stay!
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Nikolett,"Michele’s place was an awesome stay. It was close enough to Newtown to walk to all the cafes and bars. The room is spacious and very comfortable with amenities to cook small meals if needed. The shower was great and looked very new. The bed was cozy and there was no noise from the street!
I think Michele has really got everything perfected to the last detail. Great value for money and we hope to stay again sometime!"
2015-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Gage,Cathy provided everything we needed for a great stay. It was a lovely room walking distance to the beach. I would definitely recommend!
2018-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Kristine,"This terrace was perfect for our party of 3 couples.
The location for cafes pubs or shopping in CBD was awesome not to mention how close it was to Blue start group for City 2 surf .
If you want to be in a safe location close to the action this is a gem."
2016-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,13562321,Josie,"The apartment is in a great location. It  does not have wifi and as I was spending two week for work it was an inconvenience so do bare this in mind. I tried to contact the hosts about this and did not get a reply from them. After an issue a week later to do with cleanliness Rob their property manager did reply to me and was very kind in offering me a meal for free for the inconvenience and got a cleaner to come in. 
A nice apartment on the whole which  just needs some TLC. 
"
2014-08-04T04:00:00.000Z,1131054,Carolyn,"Queen Street is a terrific location with a vibrant village atmosphere, cafes, specialty food stores, boutiques and more. The apartment is full of delightful surprises and charm. So much more than any hotel room. Louise's 5 star hospitality includes sharing her designer furnishings and collectibles with you, the immaculate presentation of the apartment, her warm communication style and her attention to detail to ensure you enjoy every moment of your stay."
2013-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,John,Susan was a thoughtful and considerate host.
2015-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Shelley,"Wayne and Kate were great hosts from the very first inquiry. Their responses were very timely, in some cases instant, and extremely informative.

Their property is ideal for a relaxed getaway and the views across Tamarama beach from the balcony, study and the main bedroom are stunning... it was very hard to leave! 

Great cafes and parks are within walking distance either way - around to Bondi or Bronte. Bus stops are are five minute walk and in most cases, we could jump on a bus within a few minutes that took us straight to Sydney's CBD. 

Inside the unit Wayne and Kate have thought of everything! We wanted for nothing and could find everything easily. The unit is light and bright and well suited for a family or a group friends.

The champagne on arrival blew us away and the donation from our accommodation fee to the Tamarama Surfing Life Saving Club was so touching, that we all said we would definitely stay there again!

We went to Sydney to participate in the City to Surf fun run and ended up having one of the best long weekends ever!

Thanks Wayne and Kate!"
2019-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Sen,"Evelyn and her husband were amazing hosts. Their apartment is clean and spacious. 

We loved having the  pool and the sauna in the apartment and there is an incredible view of the sea.

Our location was perfect with many of the beaches nearby. 

Overall an incredible experience, I would highly recommend Evelyn's apartment to anyone."

The apartment is stunning, the space is spotless with absolutely everything that you might need and the location is perfect. if possible we really wou;d like to go back there."
2017-04-04T04:00:00.000Z,6170899,Tim,We love Balmain and Jennifer's place is perfect for a quiet house but a short stroll to the centre.  Also the public transport is very accessible from here.  The house is very comfortable and cosy and the garden is very pleasant.

2018-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Pedro,"The good thing is location and cleanness. The location is great, near the international airport. A 10-15min walk will get you there. Also, the place was clean, and it was private. 
The downside was the smell. The room was really damp, with a strong smell. It was so strong, that I inly stayed there one night, but it impregnated my cloths. I would suggest increasing the ventilation of the space, or get a dehumidifier."
2018-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Sally,"Fantastic Airbnb stay. Was easy to find, easy check in. Great location and lovely space. Comfy bed and couch, plenty of kitchen utensils, pots etc. for cooking. Avalon is a nice quiet area and very pretty with a charming township."
2019-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,12259367,Chantal,"L’appartement d’Athena a un emplacement exceptionnel. Tous les services sont à proximité ou bien le transport est disponible tous près de l’appartement . Le secteur est très sécuritaire, tout près de Darling Harbour. Plusieurs sympathiques restaurants et cafés .
Nous avons adoré notre séjour.  Le seul élément est le manque d’espace dans la pièce principale. Il n’y a pas de sofa et le coin cuisine est au minimum pour une semaine."
2018-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,21988560,Jenny,Perfect location for airport. And easy transport into the city. Great apartment

2015-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,5993432,Isabelle,"I loved the place and the location. Hugo was communicating well before and after my booking. As he was overseas, his friend Oliver took care of the flat. He was very welcoming, solving my luggage problem and hat great tips for dining out. Thank you so much, I will be back."
2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Tracy,"Bernadette and Freds apartment is stylish and comfortable. 
We were welcomed with a fresh loaf Banana bread and a bottle of wine that set the scene for 10 great days of sunshine and relaxation. 
The apartment is directly across the rd from the beach ,with magnificent views. 
There is an easy walk to the corner cafe that serves great coffee and food., with a fabulous playground across the rd for children or big kids and a golf course at the other end of the rd that has magnificent views  up and down the coast. .
It has easy access into the city with a close bus stop so  we could enjoy the sights around Sydney and  then return to our haven. 
We will be  back ☺"

2015-03-11T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Alex,"DJ was a nice host. He was there upon our arrival. Great location if you want the hustle and bustle of Darlinghurst. House is located in a very quite neighborhood. For two grown adults the room is a little small, plus luggage makes for a tight fit."

2019-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,20906161,Tom & Tracey,"Good location next to central station. Fairly spacious unit with lots of amenities. It is particularly suitable for younger people. Alexey is an excellent, caring host. The unit can be hard for taxi or Uber driver to find, but the entrance is just a few meters left of Dominoes Pizza. Light sleepers may have difficulty with light as the blackout curtains do not fully close."
2018-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,23106836,James,5th time I've stayed. Judy is always very wuick to respond and her easy check in process makes it very flexible when i sometimes have to check in late :)

2018-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,6785160,Simon,"Lovely and very well-kept home. Superb comfort and privacy. Good value and great access via local public transport. Would definitely recommend this place for anyone staying a few days in Sydney, who isn't focused on beaches. Easy 20 mins walk to Newtown and wide selection of eateries, bars and shopping. Can get a bus or train to Sydney centre, beaches or airport with ease. 
Buddy is irresistibly cute and very friendly.
Steve and Carole were very good hosts and very flexible for our needs. 
Highly rated and possibly the best Airbnb experience we had so far in Australia."

2016-06-16T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Alex,"As picture showed, it is a creative home. Located in eastern sub, easy to access city. The queen size bed is fit for solo traveller more than the couple."

2017-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Jean-Pierre,"I can definitely recommend Ali's place. Beautiful granny flat with all the essentials needed to get by. It is great that there is Netflix and internet included as well as it helps a great deal with entertaining kids now and then when needed. The location is also great with easy access to and from the suburb. 

We really enjoyed our time here."
2016-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Delaina,Victoria was a super host. The place was very clean and looked just like the pictures. It was in prime location. We thoroughly enjoyed staying there.
2018-12-12T05:00:00.000Z,30056291,Karen,This is an amazing apartment to stay in. The views are fantastic and Nick’s recommendations on restaurants were spot on. The place is spotless and nice extra touches like meeting me when I arrived even though my timing was out just made my visit more special. Nick is a very thoughtful host and certainly goes that bit extra to make your stay enjoyable. Thanks again Nick
2018-04-20T04:00:00.000Z,16964637,Tiffany,Great stay at Judy’s place. Walking distance to my course and train station. Highly recommended :)
2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Tanya,"Great central location, close to everything.  The place had everything you needed, may need a little revamp , but definitely will go back."
2017-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Ruixue,"The apartment is very stylish and lovely. Alexey was very thoughful during our stay. Great location, 1 min walk from central station. We cut short our stay due to unforeseen situation. But overall the stay was wonderful! Thank you Alexey!"
2016-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Mel,"Michy's place is in a wonderful location, perfectly located for exploring around Pittwater and the coast. It is quiet and extremely comfortable. With lots of windows, the cottage is light and breezy. Everything we needed was there and it is immaculately presented. Michy and Paul were on hand if we ever needed anything, but they also ensured we had privacy. A perfect mix!  The beach is just a minute away (across the road) and is a lovely spot to sit. Although we had a car, the local bus stop is just across the road. We could not fault Michy's place and look forward to the next trip. 
"
2017-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Janelle,"A brilliant, quiet, central location; absolutely perfect. Would definitely stay at your apartment again! Thank you so much."
2018-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,21999107,Jim,This is an outstanding place to stay in Sydney with so much to see and do and even just to unwind. Great hosts and will be coming back for sure. Highly recommend
2019-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,25977467,Eva,"Great location, very close to Darling Harbour. Sadly the neighbours were very noisy the days we were there, but after we had a talk to them it helped. Good space for 3 people."

2016-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,9802077,Toni,"Helena is a charming host, who met me to hand over the keys and show me the unit. 
The studio is bright and compact with a well equipped kitchen, and a comfortable bed. The balcony has a great view!
This is a quiet neighbourhood, only a short walk to shops, cafes and transport.
The waterfront walk to Rozelle or the Fish markets is a bonus."
2012-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Jeroen,"Had a great stay at David's modern styled and very clean house. He was very flexible in accommodating my very early arrival. The location can't be beat, it's very central and I was able to walk to the meetings I had in Sydney. There is a lot to do nearby but the apartment is a block away from the noise: you'll sleep well! I wish I could have stayed longer!"
2015-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Lucia,The apartment is perfect for a Sydney visit - complete with everything you need. A range of tourist information was left fir us which was helpful.
2017-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,16070079,Gerard,"This was probably the most professional Airbnb I've stayed at. The place was great, everything was well organised and thought out. My stay here was perfect."
2018-03-29T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Gill,Fantastic location with beautiful views. Beach and bars a short walk away and a bus stop right outside. The studio is clean and well equipped for all your needs and Anita was a perfect host. We look forward to staying a third time.
2014-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Ronny,I have stayed for one week with Naveen and Tris. The flat is perfectly located and really nice. Naveen and Tris have been really helpful and were great to hang out with.
2017-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,17045341,Jessica,"WOW I cannot recommend these wonderful people enough! The room was spacious and clean, the area was shared but they gave me so much privacy that I would never have a problem :) Ed and his partner gave me a million amazing suggestion on places to go according to what I was interested in and made me feel at home and welcome constantly. Would highly recommend this place! Convenient right into the city yet quiet area :)"
2016-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,12259367,Tim,Great location and fantastic apartment. I'd definitely stay again
2018-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,5549057,Vince,"I had a very comfortable stay! The place is in a great location, close to the beach and public transportation. I would definitely recommend his place to anybody looking to stay in Bondi Beach."
2016-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Molly,"Angela and her husband Jeff were so great. Such lovely, kind hosts. Their Airbnb is phenomenal, fresh yoghurt and jam in the fridge, fresh fruit and a gorgeous, spotless apartment. My three friends and I had a blast.
Would absolutely stay again. 
Thanks Angela and Jeff!!"
2018-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Joanna,"We had a lovely 2 night stay at Simone’s house, within walking distance to shops and a lovely outside area and convenient lock up garage as limited parking out front. "
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,22304343,Alfredo,"I’m sorry to write a bad review but we are very disappointed about this booking. I’ve sent this comments to the owner but we haven’t received any response or assistance. 

The place was very dirty. It Looks this hasn’t been cleaned to receive people. Actually it looks it has not been cleaned in a while.

There were cockroaches all around the place, mainly in the living room and the kitchen.
 
Bed clothes in the Bedroom were used (you expect clean sheets when you book a place)

Sitting in a sofa so dirty is disgusting. And the tv and electronics were not properly connected to use. Everything is full of dust and dirtiness.
We had to clean the chairs and table to be able to use them. 

The add says “breakfast provided” but that was not been arranged.

The humidity smell is really bad and it should be a comment in the description warning about that before booking.

To sum up, our stay in this place was not pleasant. We came with a lot of expectations to have a good time for new year in Sydney. This is the first time I have a bad experience with Airbnb.

My family want to have a good time and don’t want to waste all our days being uncomfortable. 
They asked me to move to a clean place from the beginning. This was a big problem because booking with no anticipation here, these days is very difficult to find and also is very expensive. I would like to cancel from the first day but we couldn’t find another place until now.

I’m claiming for the full refund plus the cleaning fees since this apartment hasn’t been cleaned for receiving us. I also ask for the service fees to compensate this really bad experience. 

This is the first time I have a bad experience booking a place with Airbnb. I know this is just an isolated case and I trust that the company will resolve my dispute fairly."

2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Alecia,MissD's place is really clean and cosy. Fantastic location in cool Newtown with plenty of bars and restaurants on offer. Super easy to access and MissD was clear with instructions upon arrival. We had everything we needed so didn't need to follow up on anything during our stay. We were sharing with three other guest rooms but the house was cleaned regularly and guests were respectful of each other. Great value and would highly recommend for a stay in Sydney!
2014-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,1950395,Carolan,"Debbie and David have a beautiful house which we enjoyed thoroughly while visiting Sydney.  Plenty of space, fantastic kitchen and lovely pool and garden area for barbecues.  Very close to Manly for ferry trips to Sydney, but Manly itself was a big hit with us.  Definitely best beach according to our girls.  We can't recommend this house highly enough and will definitely be back. Thank you to both.  Great hosts!!"
2018-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Jessica,Great location for easy access to the airport
2017-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,10213499,Louise,"Our stay at Tracy's studio in Narabeen was a delight. We were very comfortable and everything we needed was there. The balcony was a great place to sit and read and listen to the birds. Sari (the dog) was an added bonus. She is such a well behaved dog and I loved it when she appeared to say hello. 

All amenities are close by. Walk to cafes, restaurants and the beach. On my next visit to Sydney I hope Tracy's studio will be available. Tracy is a great host and very accommodating. We felt very ""at home"" staying there.

2018-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Ruth,"Bryan was a great host. Excellent communication, a great space a fabulous location. Exactly as promoted: accommodation with soul, close to everything. We'd love to stay again."
2012-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Eada,Great location. Could travel to Townhall easily by bus and the bus stop is just 5 minutes walk away. The area is generally safe because its located near the main junction and I feel safe walking back home because it's not one of those dark streets that you can see elsewhere. Lots of food located nearby . House is really clean and very comfortable.
2016-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Tasha,"Very pleasant stay. Excellent location being so close to restaurants, bars, and the Newtown train station. The Bed and Breakfast was spotlessly clean, had complimentary breakfast, and fast WiFi. My boyfriend and I loved the neighborhood and Mrs. D was extremely helpful with finding us parking for our van. I would highly recommend this place and would love to stay here again. "
2014-04-30T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Christine,"Very nice place and will stay again.  I stayed in the cottage, which was adequate to my needs.  Hot shower, clean and comfortable bed, good location.  What more does one need?"

2016-06-27T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Nicholas,Susan was a great host! She was keen to give us great travelling tips and was always happy and pleasure to chat with. She makes sure to give you your space as well and is pleasantly accommodating. The location is superb (quiet neighbourhood) and are in close proximity to public transit - about 10 minutes to central station by bus.
2018-06-15T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Ashleigh,Great place to stay and Paul is amazing to communicate with.

2017-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,22297561,Prudence,"Great location, just off the M7 but quiet neighbourhood. Private entrance with car park right out the front. Easy checkin, even on Christmas Day. Comfy bed. Old bathroom with European style toilet in shower but worked well enough for us."
2014-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Alex,"This was probably one of our best hosts during our trip around New Zealand and Australia. She was very very helpful, giving us advice and tips about the best way to visit Sydney and their main spots.

The cabin is big, with plenty of space for two people, its own toilette and shower, and even a small living room where rest. 

The situation of the place was very good, with plenty of bus stops to the city and other spots of the city.

She was as kind to let us use her kitchen, and use some of her cooking stuff. 

She was really lovely, a perfect host, and we highly recommend staying with her."
2017-05-16T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Valerie,"Fantastic! Desireé made the entire stay flawless - sent detailed arrival info days before, had keys waiting for us at the front desk, a bottle of wine waiting upon arrival, and a spotless apartment with all possible amenities. Great home base for a vacation. Public transit just across the street, restaurants are within 10 minutes walk, and a taxi stand is available right next door. Highly recommend. "
2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,12256344,Franziska,"Wenn ihr nach Sydney reisen wollt und euch wirklich mal in der Fremde zu Hause fühlen wollt, dann wohnt bei Judith und Paul.
Unserer Meinung nach findet ihr hier eine echte AirBnB-Perle. Hier vermietet nicht ein größeres Unternehmen mit einem fingierten Besitzer, sondern hier wohnt ihr bei echten Sydneysidern und habt die Chance bei warmherzigen, wundervollen Menschen einen kleinen Einblick in das Leben in Sydney zu bekommen."
2014-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Werner,"Very lovely, sunny and clean apartment.
Very tastefully furnished.
All equipment available including washing machine and dryer.
Although we did not meet Louise she arranged everything perfectly!
It might be a little noisy because of nearby mainroad....."

2018-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Eva-Maria,"MissD's house is very central in Newtown with good access to public transportation, restaurants and cafes. The house has a lot of character and our room was beautifully decorated. Basic breakfast was provided and we enjoyed having access to a well-stocked kitchen where we could interact with the other guests. We were in the downstairs bedroom and you did hear a bit of noise from upstairs and the front door. But we knew that in advance so it wasn't a problem. 

Street parking is usually 2hrs, however there are some streets in the area with no restrictions.

Overall very good value, a great place to stay in Sydney and we recommend MissD's house."
2017-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Amanda,"Communication with Danny was great and we met his brother upon check in. Location is quite favourable to those like to walk everywhere. 20mins walk to fish market, sydney harbour or less than 10 mins walk to the Sydney tower, Westfield, QVB.... slightly outdated with the furnishing however since we only stayed for 2 nights so overall still acceptable."
2018-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,16549021,Sarah,"Robert was a great Host. Communication was great, check in easy. Spare bedding came in handy, and the accommodation was clean, tidy & as described. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend."

2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Corey,Desireé is a wonderful host. She's easy to contact and responds promptly when you send her an email. Her place is very comfortable and clean. She let us arrive early and we had no problem staying an extra night. We really appreciated that!! Transport to the city and surrounding areas are very close to her place. Great place to walk around lots to see and do. I would definitely stay again :)
2016-05-23T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Matthew,"Awesome host and place that is very clean, comfortable and in a fantastic location. MissD was a fantastic and friendly host, and I'd definitely recommend staying with her."

And she already replied with action on some minor suggestions for further improvement of the property such as trimming of trees/branches along driveway for easier parking of vehicle, etc. 

Overall, I will recommend this place to my friends/relatives especially for big families like us. 

Thanks Leena for being a nice and great host! God bless always"
2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,23510317,Caoimhe,"Jason and David were extremely helpful, attentive hosts however the apartment was a little below our expectations. Quite basic standard and very poor shower. Fine for a brief stay if you’re not spending a lot of time in the place."

Thoroughly enjoyed my stay."
2018-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,Armin,"Contact the host and make sure the air con and other amenities listed are ACTUALLY working and EXIST as I was fooled about the aircon which was broken and he knew it but didnt inform me. Its very similar to a hotel room structure and he is not leaving in the premises, therefore be aware of likely poor communication as for my time he was overseas and couldnt get to him by phone."

2016-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Marion,"Ich hatte das Zimmer bei David für eine Woche gebucht.
Alles war wie beschrieben bzw. auf den Fotos abgebildet, sehr schön und sauber. Die Lage ist optimal, um die Stadt zu erkunden, Bushaltestelle gleich ums Haus, dennoch ist das Zimmer selbst ruhig, so dass man gut schlafen kann.
Wer ein Zimmer im CBD sucht, ist hier richtig.
David war bemüht, mir zu helfen, wenn ich eine Frage hatte und sehr höflich.
Danke David!"

2016-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,6046461,Fiona,"A lovely host and lovely apartment - I would highly recommend at stay at Suzie's. The guest facilities are excellent - with a very comfortable bedroom with ample storage, and full bathroom facilities for your private use. Although being in an extremely central location, the noise of the city traffic did not bother me in the slightest (I slept sooo soundly!). The location is excellent, with numerous restaurants/cafes and the Darling Harbour ferry service just a 2 minute stroll away. The nearest train station is only a short walk too. Suzie herself was a very warm and helpful, but also unobtrusive, host - perfect for this fairly independent traveller.
I would certainly seek to stay again at Suzie's for any future visits to Sydney."
2018-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,25977467,Jake,"This place is in a very good location, the host helped us whenever we needed and it was a really nice stay for all of us. Would highly recommend and book there again :)"
2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Sophie,Lovely spot and Cathy was very accommodating and responsive. Nice and clean room with personal touches which made the stay more enjoyable.
2017-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Rafael,"Pro: Linda is a great host. Communicates well. Amenities in the apartment are good, she provides everything one needs. Plenty of space, two couples could stay comfortably. 

Con: No air conditioning. Most of the year this should be fine but I was here during a heat wave and it made the stay unbearable. Most of the time I wore only shorts and was still sweating like crazy, even with fans on and windows open."
2016-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,9098095,Steve,"Location, location, location. We are North American residents and stayed two weeks. From Minto Heights, the train station and local mall are only ten minutes away. The train ride to Sydney is only about an hour, the drive to the Blue Mountains about two hours, to Illawarra about an hour-and-a-half, and to Canberra, about two-and-a-half hours. It's a perfect location to see much of the Sydney-Canberra area. Staying in a converted railcar is a unique experience. It is not like a standard apartment and some of the spaces are a little quirky. John and Margaret are excellent hosts and we found nothing wanting. Our stay was both comfortable and pleasurable. We would return in a minute! "
2015-08-09T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Alan,"Clean, basic accommodation and a convenient base during our stay in the northern beaches district of Sydney. Loved waking up to the sound of the birds! I recommend the short walk down to Paradise beach. Cathy, David and Max were great, and made sure we had everything we needed without making a fuss. Thanks!"
2018-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,24916551,Illya,"Special thanks to Alice & Richard for being a nice host. Both are responsive. The house is near with Beverly Hills train station, located in a quite and beautiful neighbourhood. 

We found that the kitchen utensils were well provided and we got comfort bed and clean bedsheets. The living room was spacious & TV was provided. There was a washing machine, iron with iron board and a cloth hanger in laundry area but it would be great if there is a dryer as well.

Overall I had a nice stay in Alice's place because it is such a cozy and spacious house"
2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,30722343,Kyle,"Patty’s house was beautiful decorated, nice and close to famous Bondi, remarkably quiet being only meters to all the action. Patty always responded quick and answered all questions I had for her. She was very flexible with check out asking me first what time I would like...
I would recommend to anyone who wants to be amongst the action but can look forward to some peace and quiet

2014-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,David,"4 bee hives in the backyard when the host knew we were bringing children was not a good start. House needed a good airing out and kitchen a thorough wipe down. Also tv and dvd not working. Once we had come to terms with these drawbacks, the place was fine but not worth $500 a night in our opinion. "
2014-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Victoria,"We had a great week at Simone's place in Randwick. The home was very clean, well equipped with everything we needed and exactly as presented in the photos. Public transport and shops were very convenient and it was helpful to have a garage as street parking was a little difficult on some days. Simone was very responsive and we would love to stay here again when in Sydney. "
2018-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Sue,The room was very conveniently located near the airport with the ability to shower and crash into bed after a long flight.

We unfortunately had a rainy week but made the most of the spa. The multi levels made for a great way to get some privacy and shift people around for entertaining. We will definitely book again.

Das machte uns nichts aus also kamen wir an und er war noch da. Die Begrüßung war freundlich und zuvorkommend. Er hat uns alles wichtige gezeigt. Einzig komische Sachen, dass wir unser Bett selbst beziehen durften. naja. Darüber sieht man hinweg wenn man das tolle Apartment sieht mit der super Lage! "

2017-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,16549021,Kala,"Robert's place was absolutely amazing, it was everything that we imagined. It is in the perfect location for wondering into Cronulla for cafes and shopping, plus only a short walk to the beach. I would highly recommend Roberts home for your next stay."

The location and accomodation was exactly what I required for my visit to see my mother in Sydney. But Konrad was very organized. Thanks again and if your ever in Canada please don't hesitate to connect with us.  
Kind regards, Tracey and Bob Forster"
2017-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Janet,"Desiree is an amazing host and had the perfect space for us! It started from wonderful communication to easy early check in. It continued with an immaculate unit that provided us an oasis from our sight seeing. We use Airbnb quite a bit and especially enjoy being able to have a kitchen area for a quick breakfast or meal and morning coffee. The unit was close to grocery, public transport and amenities were as if I had lived there. We were there to celebrate my spouse's 50th birthday and were pleasantly surprised by the nice and thoughtful birthday card. Thank you again and we had a blast!"
2014-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Nicole,"While appreciative of last minute availability and sincere efforts of host in transit, my first ever airbnb stay wasn't particularly encouraging. A working key safe is a priority. I put my work colleague under inconvenience in the 3 trips to home it took to get access."
2018-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,27009904,Liqun,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2015-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,7439246,Rachel,This was our first time using airbnb and it was made so easy with the help of Nathan.  His responses were always so quick and helpful. This was an absolutely lovely property and was everything it said in the listing.  We felt so welcome in this home and thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Maroubra!
2018-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,Leslie,Location is second to none and the place is spotless and is equipped with everything you need and more

Linda was a fantastic host who was more than accommodating during my stay. Thanks a bunch!"
2016-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Libby,My partner and I stayed two nights recently and enjoyed our time in the beautiful Northern Beaches. I didn't get to meet Michy personally although my partner did. Communication through messages was always prompt and clear and we arrived late at night with the key left in the door and milk in the fridge for us. The cabin is cosy and had everything we needed. We couldn't get the wifi to connect but it didn't really bother us we were hardly there. I suggest you take your car as the bus only came out the front once an hour. Palm Beach close by is beautiful.
2019-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Helen,"If this Airbnb is available, YOU HAVE TO BOOK IT! There are no words to describe how beautiful and close the beach this apt is. You honestly feel like royalty when you are here. The view is breathtaking- you see Bondi Beach from your bed. At night, you hear the waves crashing against the shore. Perfect location- close to the Bondi strip where all of the cute cafes, shops, restaurants are located. (Also, there is bus stop a block from the apt so you can get to Sydney Harbor/inner city  in 20 min for $3).  Anita does an amazing job at making you feel welcome and accommodated. This Airbnb is spotless, comfortable,  and I would stay here a million more times if I could."

2018-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Mohd,"Thanks Fred and Bernadette for a very pleasant and comfortable stay! 

The first time we entered the house, it was all OMG-the-house-is-amazing! The inside was 100% as described and pictured in the photos. And the view was so EXTRA! We managed to enjoy beautiful sunrises before we headed out. We definitely made the right choice staying there! 

Not just that, we were welcomed with a pack of Tim Tam, milk and fresh juice on our first day! Talking about the facilities and amenities in the house, they’re all complete. From the shampoos, body wash, to clean towels and hangers. From the variety of cookwares and to coffee powders and a box of teabags. 

Fred and Bernadette were very accommodating too. There was a day where we run out of body wash and told them about it and when we reached home at night, there’s a new one in front of the door. 

We were out of the house early in the morning and only be home at 9/10pm. Sadly we couldnt manage to meet Fred and Bernadette to say how thankful we were for a very nice stay in their Airbnb house. Luckily we bumbed into Fred after his morning jog right before we left to airport! He was curious of whether we enjoyed our stay and asked if there is anything that is lacking. Worry not, it was all perfect. 

Thanks Fred and Bernadette. "
2013-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,794910,Lucia,"Gavin's place is very clean and well laid out and is ideally located close to Central Station. We stayed for four nights over New Years Eve and enjoyed our time immensely!

What we liked the most was the host! He is a very good person, respectful, cordial and polite at all times. He even made time to show us the tourist attractions as well as some of the local hotspots.

We shared some great evenings with Gavin and enjoyed the conversation on a range of interesting topics. During our stay, I also had the chance to introduce him to my favourite European drink ""the Hugo"" which went down a treat! ;)

We enjoyed staying in Surry Hills and can happily recommend the place and the host, and if given the chance would gladly stay there again.
"
2016-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,2711936,Lisa," Stayed with Karen for almost 2 weeks. Where do I begin?  To say she was a fabulous host is an understatement. She was very kind, helpful and took time to write places of interest  to visit. I was made to feel very much at home at put at ease. Couldn't have picked a better place to stay.  I have enjoyed doing yoga with her,going for walks,we even found time to go for dinner one evening. 
I would highly recommend this place to stay as it is so close to the beach and public transport. Would definitely come back!"
2018-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Joe,"Fantastic location only a few minutes walk to the beach, cafes and shops. Just note that the house is a little dusty and sandy in parts."

Easy access to bus routes (15-20 min ride to/from the airport via Uber), beautiful views from The Grade Parade (about one block away), plenty of food options AND such an easy going, welcoming and generous host! I highly recommend Hernan's Airbnb if you're staying in Sydney."
2015-06-30T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Sandy,All of our queries prior to arrival were happily replied to very promptly. Wayne and Kate emailed us a list of attractions / activities that may have interested us during our stay. On arrival we were presented with a nice bottle of champagne which we certainly appreciated.

Also close to shops, Food etc. Sarah is such a fantastic host who was always available if we needed anything and was always up for a chat. The room was nice and clean and the pool was the icing on the cake with most days being in the high 30’s low 40’s. We will book again next year and I can’t recommend her enough. Thanks Sarah for a fantastic stay."

The apartment itself is located near lots of restaurants and bars and it was very easy to get around the city with the train station being close by. I definitely recommend this place!"
2017-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Marie,"This is fine if you want a basic place, but it is not as private as the description. We had to walk through the whole house to get there, and then had to go back into the house to find basics like cups and tea bags and milk. There are a lot of mosquitos - we had brought our own mossie spray and I recommend it."

I found the cabin a convenient short drive to trendy Avalon village with cafes, restaurants, and local shops. It was also great to walk down to the Pittwater and swim in the local’s netted beach area. Can recommend booking with Michy who is a friendly, and easy going host."

Le cœur de la ville est accessible en 10 min à pied. L’appartement est spacieux et très confortable, très bien équipé. Tous les petits tracas ont été prévu : exemple, le 2 e jour une ampoule a grillé : il y avait dans un placard tout un stock pour en changer facilement. 
L’hote réponds rapidement, avec beaucoup de gentillesse.
Je conseille cet appartement pour découvrir Sydney sans avoir de véhicule"
2017-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,13193079,Tess,"Do not stay here.  EVER. 
The ""host"" is rude and invades on your privacy as and when she pleases.  The ""home"" is an ex-hotel room and is one of 40 apartments she owns that have never been lived in. Its dirty, almost everything is broken, the air-conditioning unit leaks, its loud as hell, it cuts out and it looks like it could fall off the ceiling at any point in time.  
This place is a cheap and nasty room used to circumnavigate the standards set by normal accommodations.  Still waiting for Airbnb to fix this problem, have been waiting for them to respond for a month!
STEER CLEAR"
2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Vinicius,"Since the moment we arrived at the place Duncan was so kind with us. He was ALWAYS attentive and ready to help us and answer our questions.

2019-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,17606304,Renae,"Had a great stay at Christine and Patrick's when visiting family that lives nearby. Plenty of room for the two of us. My son was lucky enough to score the main room while I was fine on the sofa bed. Easy check in. Secure place, very clean and had everything you need to stay. So grateful for the shampoo in the bathroom as mine had exploded in my suitcase during my flight. These little touches make a difference! Most appreciated the check out time of 12pm!  Very comfortable space we would stay again. I can definitely recommend. Thanks Christine and Patrick:)"

The large, modern kitchen with an elegant dining area attached was great for our family needs. Fei is a very helpful and generous host. An excellent stop-over destination if you find hotels sterile and expensive."

No problems checking in, the apartment is cozy and clean, and well-equipped. Also just 5 mins by bus across the ANZAC bridge into the city. We looked forward to coming 'home' each day after our explorations. Thanks again, Duncan and Ashlee for contributing to our  memorable stay in Sydney!"

2015-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Ken,"We stayed here for three nights as we travelled along the NSW coast.   Belinda and Chris were both helpful and hospitable. 

The studio was comfortable, well-equipped and clean, with a nice covered veranda in the secluded garden.  

It was also just a few minutes walk to the pretty and quiet Jibbon Beach and a short drive to the shops in Bundeena itself.  The more popular beaches at Wattamolla and Garrie are about 20-30 minutes drive away. 

Thanks for allowing us to stay in your place.  We would be very happy to stay there again if we make a return trip. 
Ken and Rosemary"

2018-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,22378312,John,"We really liked Lachlan's apartment. Lachlan was very helpful and responsive. The location is about half way between the Rocks and Bondi beach which was nice. The only complaint was we were there in winter and the nights were very cold and there was no central heating and we only had one small space heater to heat four rooms. Otherwise, highly recommended. "
2017-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Callan,"Yang and her husband were excellent hosts. Great communication and were well prepared for our checkin. Apartment was very clean, sunny and only a lovely stroll over the bridge to public transportation. "
2016-07-19T04:00:00.000Z,888107,Florence,The place was quiet and clean. I just wish  there  was a heating  in the  room as its winter  and the room is very  cold. Lucky i got thick  onesie to sleep on. Plus I suggest  atleast 1 clean towel to use for the  guest  on the duration  of their stay  would be good. I have to buy my own towel somewhere.

As a former local I can attest to the convenient location, it's a short walk to the heart of Newtown.

The place was very clean and Michele has thought of everything to ensure a comfortable stay. 

She's a very attentive host, friendly and helpful and respectful of privacy. 

Can highly recommend staying here if you're looking for the inner west experience. "

We strongly recommend this place - Craige & Leonie are fantastic hosts - they were answering all our questions and recommended great place to see in Sydney. Location of the place is very good - just next to Bondie Beach - very close to all restaurants and shops, but it is quiet at the same time. We really enjoyed our time there and we will recommend it to all our friends!"

Manly is a beautiful suburb, the unit is walking distance to everything and like the area has both charm and history. THe really surprise is inside. The renovation is elegant, tasteful and professional. The room itself has water views and is comfortable and functional.

It’s on my list to revisit next time I back bu the sea!"

The location was fantastic, a lovely walk to the beach and Simone was fantastic in all her correspondences. "
2016-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,13302796,Craig,"The apartment is well positioned right on Hyde Park and 300m from the train. There is a great view over King's Cross including sun and moon rises. Rooms are bright and spacious although only one has cupboard space. Gym, swimming pool, Jacuzzi and sauna are easily accessible. The single bathroom/toilet would make it difficult to accommodate 8 people, even though there are beds for 8."
2017-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,884057,George,"We had a very pleasant stay in Maree's property. It was clean and spacious. The cooking facilities were slightly limited, but it was very easy to work around!

Overall, Maree's Airbnb was amazing and I would happily stay there again! "

It is great for anyone wanting to feel immersed in nature but still have the beach and shops just a few minutes away. The design of the home is amazing - with huge windows and all natural materials throughout. Molly was lovely to deal with and made communication easy. Would definitely love to stay again!

Sorry for the late response but we have been busy. Jeremy responded promptly to our request and was helpful with suggestions by email. My wife, myself & my family all enjoyed our stay at this house.. Location could not have been better. We were within walking distance of all we came to do such as go to the theatre, walk in the Botanical Gardens, eat at good restaurants and for some,to visit the shops.We found it is in a great central location. Your accommodation provided for us what we (Website hidden by Airbnb) has a lovely spacious living area, a fully equiped kitchen, good laundry facilities and four (Website hidden by Airbnb) toilets and bathrooms were both more than adequate. We enjoyed the cafe nearby called "" The Rusty Rabbit"". We would not hesitate to rent your accommodation again. Thank you.
Mark"
2017-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Dylan,"Check in was very easy, the studio was well maintained (although ceiling heights are low, and the lights are fluorescent). The host was excellent with communication and the location is excellent."
2013-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Nick,"This garden studio is absolutely comfortable  and private but also very clever in the way it uses space. Cath is a generous host providing muesli, home made muffins and fresh eggs from her very own chooks..wow. I was only able to enjoy 2 nights but I hope to stay again soon. "
2017-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Sharon,"Nicole was an excellent host and the apartment is lovely and actually looks as nice as the photos! The only issues were with the internet not working one day (which should be fine now that NBN has been installed), loud music on the Friday and Saturday nights from neighbours and construction noise from the building works across the road from 7.30am 6 days a week. Overall a lovely apartment and I had a good stay but it may not work for you if you are a light sleeper wanting to sleep in on a holiday!"
2017-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,888107,Karen,Strongly recommend! Julie is very nice and friendly. The house is very pretty. Check in and out is easy. Some high quality local cafe nearby. Would definitely visit again next time in Sydney!
2016-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Kevin,"One of the best experiences I've had using AirBnB.  Natasa is a gem of a host.  Her place is very well organised and she is super friendly.  Location is right next to station too, which is convenient.  I would highly recommend staying here."
2015-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Emma,"Mags was prompt in communications and she was very flexible to check in and out times which we really appreciated.
The apartment is exactly as seen in the photos and had all the basics that we needed for a short stay in Mosman, it was clean, had a comfy bed and good shower. (though we did notice hot water seemed to run out quickly)
We didn't actually meet Mags and we missed the personal touch you often get when staying in airbnb accomodation. 
"
2017-09-20T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Libby,"We had 4 wonderful nights  at Vickie's apartment.  She met us there, showed us around the apartment and recommended several restaurants you can see on the street below.  The view and location is terrific.  It is an easy 5 minute walk to the train station.  The towels and bedding were top notch.  We made use of the chromecast for streaming tv shows.   The indoor plants are a great touch, very impressed to see a healthy fiddle leaf fig, I should have asked Vickie for tips.  There is nowhere to hang clothes up but when I travel I usually just live out of the suitcase anyway.  Definitely recommend staying here!"
2018-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,22323221,Yonglin,"这是我第一次在BNB上订房,对这次住宿体验十分满意,房间宽敞､明亮､干净,卧室里准备了我们所需的床上用品,卫生间有洗漱用具､毛巾､香薰等,厨房用品里一应俱全,房东考虑的十分周到｡我女儿到新南威尔士大学读书,这里离大学不到5分钟的车程,很方便｡一次愉快的经历｡"

2017-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Esther,Had the most restful 5 night’s sleep. Clean and tidy little granny flat set in scenic bush land. Loved being woken up by the Kookaburras every morning. Rhonda and Michael were very welcoming and caring. Home away from home for me. Would definitely recommend Rhonda’s if its a B&B you’re after.

2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,6785160,Xuewen,"Carole and Steve are really nice and often offer suggestions on our plan or when we have some questions. Their house is clean enough and we got surprised when we arrived that it is much better than the photos and is located in a quite convenient place. It took only half an hour to get to the city by train or bus, and so does the airport.  They provide us a living room, a bedroom and also a private bathroom, which made us feel like a home. By the way, their little Buddy is also very cute and always showed friendly to us."
2016-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,10213499,Christian,Perfect studio for a beachy getaway. Went away with the girlfriend and was well suited for a couple. The studio had everything you could need. Had foxtel with IQ which was was a supprise. Was close enough to walk to the beach or pub. Quick to respond to questions. Nothing to fault!

2018-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,16898275,Michelle,Trent was prompt and clear in his communications. We did a last minute booking and Trent organised the cleaners to ensure a clean apartment with our arrival. The apartment is located on a quiet residential area. One block away to the sea and a short walk to the ferry. It is a peaceful area and there is plenty of space in the apartment. We found it comfortable and homely with lots of plants and a beautiful kitchen. Would recommend!

2015-04-20T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Christin,"Lovely hosts, beautiful place, perfect stay!
We loved staying with Ashlee and Duncan and really enjoyed chatting with them! They we're so friendly, caring and we felt very welcome!
The guest room is perfectly equipped, the bed so comfortable and we could really feel that they're both experienced travellers and therefore know about travellers' needs: chocolate on the bed, maps and recommendations,  the cleanliness of the whole place and the warm atmosphere, everything just perfect!
The apartment is also located very good, it is quiet, perfect for a relaxing sleep, but at the same time very easy to get around from there and we felt very safe in the nice neighborhood!
Of course communication was very easy too! 
Highly recommended, if we return to Sydney we would love to stay with Ashlee and Duncan again! Thank you so much for everything!!"
2018-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,18082902,Salvia,"Had a great stay and will definitely be back. Close to shops, markets and public transport. Very convenient."
2017-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Kristin,"It was our first trip to Sydney and we weren't sure what area to stay in. Although due to the rain we ultimately ended up ubering the flat is very conveniently located near several bus stops. It's completely private as well and clean. It's got all the basics needed for a great get away. You can make breakfast in the main house and she's for oatmeas, cereals, teas and coffees to choose from. Although The weather was muggy if you keep the fan on and the windows cracked you can blow most of it out. Susan is also very down to earth and very helpful with directing us with travel! Would definitely recommend."
2017-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Kylie,Amazing location and every little detail in the house has been well thought out. Fantastic for extended families and groups. We can't wait to come back.

2014-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Lani,"Susan's Bronte cottage was fabulous! So beautiful, light-filled and comfortable. Susan has taken care to make the studio a real home away from home. When staying at an apartment while on a trip it's often the little things you remember the most that help make your trip a special one. There was muesli, milk, juice and fresh fruit waiting upon arrival. How lovely! And the location could not be better--a 10- minute walk to the beach (one of Sydney's most beautiful!), and an even shorter one to the charming main street with cafes and shops. Thanks so much, Susan. Can't wait for the next visit!"
2018-04-12T04:00:00.000Z,4919014,Michelle,The apartment is bright and modern and the views are amazing.  It was lovely to be met personally and taking up to the apartment and shown how everything works.  A very nice touch.
2019-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Sheila,"If you’re visiting Sydney, Paul’s place is a wonderful place to still be a tourist and play a local at the same time. It’s situated in a great location - availability to food options, walking distance to the train which was so great and neighborhood feels so safe. 


It’s comfortable for two, maybe three if your other guest is not picky with the sleeping arrangements and Paul covers everything that you’d need. If not, their cleaner Susan is available to help you should you need. Everything that Paul notes in his description is extremely accurate so we appreciated that. 

We definitely enjoyed our stay and trust you will too!"
2016-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Chloe,Vickie was a lovely host and did everything she could to help and make our stay enjoyable. The apartment is in an excellent position - close to restaurants and cafes as well as walking distance from the city. The apartment itself is great with a very comfortable bed and has everything you need.
2016-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Jeroen & Beatrijs,Great apartment in a nice neighborhood. The apartment is nicely maintained and everything was clean. It was the second time we stayed in one of the apartments of Simon & Nicole. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Sydney.
2015-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Eliana,"We had an amazing stay at Arnie's and Lorraine's home. The house is beautifully decorated, with a really interesting art collection. We also liked a lot the neighborhood, with charming architecture and close to public transport.
Our room was super comfortable, we had to work during our stay and everything work well, wifi connection is good and we enjoyed working by the pool or inside with a hot cup of coffee. 
We also got the chance to meet other guests and have a nice talk with them.

Definetly recommend this place , it's was our first time in Sydney and we loved it. Like other guests mentioned on her review, it makes you want to move there!

So Arnie and Lorraine, thank you! "

2018-05-14T04:00:00.000Z,6170899,Alethea,"My siblings and I stayed here for 10 nights. This is one of the best Airbnb places we ever stayed at! The house is just beautiful with a nice garden. It has 3 bedrooms and 2 full baths. Close to public transport and shops. The kitchen is well equipped to cook a full meal. We only cooked once just because there’s so many restaurants in Sydney. Lots of towels, the bed and pillows were comfortable, the bed sheets smelled fresh and there’s even bathrobes for us to use. Wifi was fast. Jennifer was a great host. Highly recommended. Will definitely stay here again!"
2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,1979960,Jennifer,"Great place to stay in a nice area. Our stay was completely hassle-free - something you don't always get with some places. Instructions were thorough and no need for a whole lot of communication throughout our stay, though Jeremy was easily contactable if needed. Overall we had an extremely pleasant stay."
2018-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,12098138,Travis & Melissa,"Lizzy's place was perfect for our family - it's open, airy, with a balcony, some toys for the kids, plenty of entertainment options and so close to the parks and beaches. Lizzy was an awesome host with great communication, some really nice touches (amenities and some food items) and we're really grateful that she was able to accommodate an earlier-than-normal checkin time which we appreciated after 30 hours of planes and airports. We could rave on for ages, but quite simply... we'd never stay anywhere else on a trip to Sydney. "
2015-10-16T04:00:00.000Z,8559496,Roland,"Everything perfect
I recommend this place to everyone
Very clean and comfortable"

Evelyn is a great host - very friendly and easy to talk to. The apartment is full of daylight and very clean. Pittwater paradise is the perfect getaway! We didn't want to leave...

2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,20865085,Ray,This is the best it can get on AirB&B
2014-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Alice,"We stayed in Simone's house for a week (two couples with two babies) and had a wonderful time! The house is lovely - beautiful linen and towels provided; well appointed kitchen & laundry, and even a lovely little courtyard with outdoor setting! We loved it and can't recommend it enough. Also so impressed by the professional cleaning service who left the house in pristine condition for us. "
2018-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Janet,"This was our first AirBNB experience, so have nothing to compare it to, however, Vickie was very accommodating and we appreciated all the thoughtful touches in the apartment.  The apartment was small (as stated it is a studio - one room and a bathroom), but perfectly suitable for a couple as a base to explore the immediate area. The Kings Cross underground is within a 5 minute walk for locations further afield.  There were a couple of minor things that needed to be fixed for future guests (towel rail and shower head in bathroom), but Vickie said she would get these arranged after we left.  They did not affect our experience in any way, which was very pleasurable."
2018-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,18130053,Nicholas,Good place to stay for a good value

2015-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Rhys,"Had an excellent stay at Hernan's, which is conveniently close to the airport. Lovely guy, ""check in"" was extremely easy and the room was lovely. Would definitely stay again if transiting through Sydney!"
2015-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Linda&Haisu,"Hernan was an awesome host - accommodating of my jet lagged early arrival and helpful in getting my luggage up the stairs. His place was clean, close to airport, beach and bus line. The bed was quite comfortable and the fast Internet made me smile after having recently dealt with the Great Firewall of China. So,if getting a straight shooter host who provides everything he said he would provide and even more appeals to you, Hernan is your guy!"
2014-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Kate,Thank you Belinda. Your studio was perfect. What a wonderful weekend!   We had every creature comfort and the location is close to everything yet felt so secluded. We will be back! :)
2017-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,James,"Perfect location for a stopover near the airport. Not much to choose from within walking distance, but Yan is a great little restaurant. Great find!"

2017-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Annette,"I genuinely enjoyed my one-week-stay at Susan's garden studio. It contains everything you need and if you want to cook your own meal, you can do so at the kitchen in the main house. Breakfast fast excellent, lots of variety. 
Susan herself was very helpful and always up for a nice chat. I received lots of good tips where to go and which busses or trains to use. 
You might consider bringing earplugs with you. Depending on the time of day, weather and/or logistics at the airport you could hear some airplanes. But this didn't bother me much. I would definitely stay at Susan's place again. "
2017-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Nick,"Supreme location, fantastic view!"

The place was very clean, beds were extremely comfortable and it was a Perfect location for anything you want to do in the city. All very close to wonderful bars and restaurants. Be warned though, there are many stairs! Very much recommended as long as you're fit!"
2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,15920870,Stew,"Great view of the racecourse and a good place to be away on business. Everything needed to cook a meal was there plus a stash of various sauces, herbs and spices. Mostly very quiet, but expect to hear the clip clop of horses passing by the window in the early morning."
2018-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,26829659,C,I was given the check in info one day before my stay though Airbnb officially said I would be given all the info three days before my stay. Host did not provide WIFI access though it was mentioned in the AD. Have been provided most of the kitchen ware. Location is very convenient if you got yourself a car. Secure parking space is a plus point. Close to DFO if you like shopping. All in all the whole apartment is fine and worth the money( nearly 300 for 3night).
2018-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Talia,"I booked this apartment for my father when he came to visit, he had a great stay! The location is amazing! It is about as close as you can  get to the beach and Icebergs pool. Great cafe and a convince store right across the road, bus stop to the city right out front, and only minutes to the main shops/cafes of Bondi. Beautiful view too! The whole apartment was spotless and the bathtub was brand new. Anita is helpful and super fast with communication. She has stocked the apartment with tons of amenities from an umbrella, to a beach chair, to sunscreen to a sewing kit, she really has tried to think of everything you need. I highly recommend staying here!"
2018-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,18338274,Lindsey,"My family and I had a great stay at Bill's Place. The house was roomy, with everything you need, and in  great central location to get around Sydney. Bill was also very responsive and detailed in his communication. Would highly recommend."
2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,23862155,Carla,Boudine’s apartment is perfect for a Bondi visit- Only a short walk to the beach! Also really nice and modern and super clean!
2015-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Hannah,Paul's place in Sydney was fantastic! Exactly like the pictures. Less than five min walk to king's cross train station. Just what we needed for a few days. The check in was a piece of cake and after traveling far that's always appreciated. We also (embarrassingly) locked our keys in the flat and Paul was very nice about it and accommodating about it.
2018-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Heather,Jared’s place was in the perfect location. About a 10-15 minute walk to the major sights and attractions. The apartment was a little more run down than I was expecting but overall we had a great experience.
2015-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Senta,"We had a lovely Stay!!! All comments, pictures etc. We're just right! This is the perfect place to stay. We found all we needed for the three off us.

The decor is lovely, the rooms are great and beds are all super comfy.  It has a great kitchen and living area as well as a large outdoor seating space where you can see the water.  Fast wifi, Bose Bluetooth, 2 smart TV's with Netflix and Spotify.  In all, it's a great apartment that you could easily feel at home living in for either a short or long stay."

2014-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Jody,"We spent two days at the Garden Studio and were impressed immediately on our arrival. Such warmth and sincere hospitality. Handed a loaf of baked bread straight from the oven within moments was an unexpected delight. The beautifully styled and thoughtfully prepared space is ideal. We felt that the attention to detail was the best we have experienced using AirBNB. From the generously stocked fridge and hamper, bathroom items, games, videos and books and even picnic gear it was clear the stylish owner is well travelled and knows how to make a space a temporary home. The kitchenette has everything you need. In fact the space and the lovely courtyard was so delightful we surprised ourselves by spending the first morning there enjoying a lazy breakfast reading the terrific range of wonderful magazines rather than head out. The location is great. At the end of the street is a lovely park where we were able to fit in a morning run. Very comfy bed, quality linen, a super quiet fan. Great information and maps were a welcome addition. We would love to return here and most likely will. Highly recommended. "
2017-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,17797004,Leah,Easy to communicate with and tidy place

The apartment was very quiet and we enjoyed our walk around the area as we toured Sydney. I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone visiting Sydney and would come back anytime! Thank You!"
2018-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Melanie,linda and linh were super accomodating and allowed an earlier check in as my flight landed early. overalk the place is comfortable and the shower has good pressure and hot water. the place was relatively close to the station and was easy to get around from.

2017-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Elson,"We booked Hugo' s apartment for the view and it certainly didn't disappoint. Fabulous views over Hyde Park and St Mary's Cathedral out to the Harbour.

The apartment is compact but well appointed and complete. It is clean and well maintained.

Communication with Hugo was excellent throughout and when our travel plans got thrown into disarray, he graciously helped us out."
2014-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Jenny,"I stayed here while exhibiting at a nearby trade show.  Arnie's house was just what I needed and it was a pity I didn't have time to 'put up my feet'.  Arnie was interststae for most of my stay so I didn't get much time to chat with him but I enjoyed chatting to the other guests in the evening.  They loved the house and were very interested in its history.
The lack of street parking was the only negative.  There is a small parking area leading to the house, but my parking skills were obviously lacking and I incurred a $1400 damage bill from the car rental firm due to scrapes on the vehicle.  Despite that I would certainly return because the house was well located and much more enjoyable than staying at a hotel."
2016-08-02T04:00:00.000Z,6170899,Christine,"This is a delightful gem cottage in Balmain with easy access to local cafes and walks, and near the city via bus or ferry. Jennifer had bus & ferry information, spare 'opal' transport cards, brochures and maps for us. Everything is beautifully presented, wonderful breakfast treats & welcome wine and chocolates. Perfect weekender when visiting Sydney."

The room was well appointed, very clean and comfortable with a gorgeous private marble bathroom located nearby. There are a few stairs but easily manageable with luggage. Elizabeth provided a concise list of all information making access to the Internet and building really easy. Would highly recommend this location for an awesome holiday experience. The hosts have gone above and beyond to make my holiday wonderful and I thank them again for it."

The furniture and fittings and kitchenware were all clean and new. The exterior of the building may seem rather run-down but once you enter the apartment, it truly feels like a home away from home. Louise was a great host and we would be happy to return again in the future. "

There were breakfast items in the refrigerator that worked very well for our mornings. She also provided fresh bagels that helped us make it through until lunch that day. The room was very very nice, secluded on the property and very quiet. It had everything that we needed and more. It is located close to a number of great restaurants and the beach! Just all around one of the best stays we had with fantastic hosts!"

The layout of the apartment it great and has been very well put together - fabulous interior style that is all very welcoming.

2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,16914825,Robin,"Me and my girlfriend stayed eleven nights at Andreas place and we were really sad to leave. Very good room with a nice own bathroom. Also a nice kitchen with a big living room. We really liked the gym, pool and the sauna because they are very clean and almost always empty. So you can relax really well because you are almost always alone. We used it almost every day!
The location is perfect as it is only 5 minutes by feet to many different bus stops, coles, restaurants and bars. The bus takes you within 10 minutes to the city but you can walk there aswell. 
Andrea is a very friendly person and answered always very fast when we had any questions and her roommates are also very friendly and helpful. 
I have nothing bad to say to the place of Andrea and we wish we stayed longer."

All one really needs to do is open the giant patio doors and sit back to enjoy the stunning views out over the swimming pool to the water and national park beyond - bliss. The apartment is finished to a very high standard and also has a sauna to relax you even further. We had a wonderful day following Evelyn's tips with a walk up to the Barrenjoey lighthouse for breathtaking views, a delicious brunch at The Boat House sat right on the water, a cocktail at Jonah's looking out on the ocean and a gourmet dinner at the Clareville kiosk (only minutes from the apartment). We will be telling all our friends and hopefully will certainly come again soon."
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,1321603,Luca,"Great host, stilish home in great location, water views . Highly recommended. Great food at brunch. Thank you Ann and Robert. See you again soon. Luca"
2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,23650892,Geon,Great stylish accommodation. Great location. The host was responsive to questions prior to our arrival. I have no hesitation to return to this suite again in the future.
2018-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,5581269,Jonathan,Michy and Paul were warm and welcoming hosts and made us feel right at home in their stylish cabin. It's in a great location with a secluded beach across the road with stunning views of Pittwater and beyond. We really enjoyed our early morning paddle on their two surf skis and some fishing from the nearby wharf. The perfect base for a relaxing getaway - I'm sure we will return.
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,16070079,David,"Lovely apartment, but could do with a little more wardrobe/drawer space."
2018-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Erin,Paul's place was wonderful! Perfect cosy sunny spot for a weekend winter getaway in Sydney! Location could not have been more central or convenient to everything in Manly!

2015-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Fiona,We had a fantastic time at Susan's place. She was there to greet us when we arrived and showed us to our room. The room was perfect. Extremely jeat and tidy and had absolutely everything we needed. It was quite private amd very close to the beach and shops so getting around was easy from her place. Will definitely be heading back again in the future!

The apartment has a fantastic view of the city skyline and bridge, as well as everything you out need for a comfortable stay."
2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Susan,Location is great. Hassle free check in and Millie responded quickly to our questions.
2017-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,17028088,Grace,Kathy’s place was such a good choice for a family. It was close to a convenient store and bus stop so getting to Coogee beach and cbd was easy and fast. It was also super close to the airport. This could be a perfect location for people who are doing lots of day trips outside the city and who like being central from all tourist attractions. We could tell Kathy thought about great hospitality. There are everything you need in the house. A huge and beautiful park is right in front of the house so you can run and exercise too. It’s great for longer stay too.
2018-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,19508741,Deen,Very nice and kind people

Everything in bondi is an easy walk from her place. Valentine and her boyfriend were both very lovely, generous, and helpful. It was wonderful to meet them both. "
2015-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,8277472,Anne & Daniel,Elizabeth and Simon were just terrific and greeted us at their beautiful appartment. They were always available if we had any questions during our stay. They cooked a delicious breakfast for us and during our stay they offer us a glass a champagne. The appartment was everything advertised and it was even better than we expected. The room was clean and very confortable with all amenities that you could need. Its easy to travel all around the city and the area is one of the best area in Sydney. Elizabeth and Simon we really enjoyed your kind hospitality.

Angela was so quick to reply to all my questions and she was very patient and flexible with check-in and check-out. Very very clean place and a cool vibe in the house! It was lovely to meet Angela and her son, as well as getting to know their travel history a little bit. Will definitely be coming back. "
2015-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Dani & Sarah-Jane,"Evelyn was a very welcoming and mindful host.  She greeted us with warm hospitality (and even a bottle of wine and some fresh fruit).   Evelyn was very prompt with her communications and flexible with our check-in and check-out times.  The space is the lower level of her home which is completely private with separate access, complete kitchen facilities, ensuite and sauna facilities.  The view of the pool and the water in the background was a beautiful sight to awaken to in the morning.  The surrounding beach areas and points of interest are easily accessible from the property.  Evelyn's place is definitely a piece of paradise - the perfect setting to unwind and relax, which is exactly what we needed. "

The room is high enough in the building that we slept comfortably with the window open without city noise.  The room is spacious, and the bed is very comfortable.  The bath and kitchen are small and dated, but perfectly functional and it was no problem for us.  I think this is a great deal for a fabulous location.  Don't miss the views from the roof."
2017-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Romina,El lugar se adecua a nuestras necesidades. La ubicación es excelente y no tuvimos ningún problema
2018-07-14T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Leilani,Very clean and comfortable. Great location. Host Ziggy was very accommodating. A must stay if staying in Manly
2017-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Tammy,"A wonderful home away from home. There was enough space to cater and allow for our family of seven couples with little ones in tow. Beautiful view and location. The kiddies loved having their own private beach and bird visitors of cockatoos, kookaburras and lorikeets every day. Just a note to make sure the fridges are cleared of food prior to the next visitors stay. "
2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Anna-Rose,Sam is beyond helpful with any questions you have or if you need anything. Extremely friendly and welcoming. We really enjoyed staying here

2014-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Sean & Summers,"BEAUTIFUL and very easy to use studio in a gorgeous garden!  Everything is done to a really high quality level, from the sheets on the perfectly made bed to the spotless interior and the fantastic breakfast box Cath left for me.  The garden is a wonderful and quiet place to hang out, although it is definitely shared between you and the host.  Privacy feels more private that a room in someone else's house, but probably less than a stand-alone apartment - reasonable since it's a studio in someone's back garden.  The neighborhood is quiet and pretty, with nice cafes and a farmer's market a 15-minute walk.  Getting into and out of other places in the city takes a while; you are not in the center of things, but in a nice neighborhood.  A car or a bike would be more flexible than using transit.  Overall a great place that I would use again!"
2016-08-04T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Benjamin,"We stayed just for a short night but enjoyed our stay.
Very clean, tidy and modern apartment. A few minutes from the airport, around 15$ by taxi.

2015-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Tanja,"Arnie's arty pad was as welcoming as the eclectic images on airbnb. He was very warm, happy to share stories about the unique residence and equally happy to give me complete space to do what I needed whilst I was there. The guest room I was in felt like I had gone completely back in time and the bath (as deep as the ocean), well, that will just have to wait til next time. Arnie's arty home in Paddington is a stones throw away from Oxford st which is super handy. Whether for work or play, in this pad, you must stay. I'll be back for sure! Thanks Arnie."

The house is really nice and on a 'quiet' leafy street.  I experienced a little noise in the evening but not too bad considering proximity to a major city, suburb.

I'd be happy to stay there again."

- Charles was very efficient in replying and accomodating our request of luggage drop off and early check in.
- Unit was spotlessly clean, strong shower, good quiet AC and has basic utensils needed in the kitchen. 
- Location is perfect for going around as it’s approx 3minutes to the closest bus stop and 20mins to central cbd; woolworths is around the corner for your grocery needs; cafes and pubs within the vicinity.
- The check in was smooth and secure. Even though the house seems fully booked, we can hardly hear any noise in our unit. It’s also secured as CCTV cameras are around the exterior of the apartment."

Awesome property! Our family had a lovely time. We had a gorgeous family bbq on sunday where my children and nephew ran around in the 'park' as my nephew called it. We all enjoyed the pool & spa - even our bubbly black lab! Beds super comfy & delightfully decorated. To top it all off - very quite neighbourhood close to all amenities. Thanks Heidi & family for sharing your fab home."
2017-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,10091713,Lucy,"Ben's apartment was perfect for a few days in Sydney - well located, clean, bright and spacious. 
It is quite big for a studio, and the floorplan gives the feel of a separate kitchen, bedroom and living area. 
A great view, well ventilated and bright. 
Ben was a great host, with really good communication. He was very accommodating with check-in and check out times. 
Only downside is that the apartment doesn't have wifi, so perhaps not ideal for business travellers or longer stays. "
2018-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Paul,Amazing location just above the icebergers - 2 minute walk to the pool and beach .  Views out over Bondi beach . Clean and nice apartment in an older style block .

Imogen is a wonderful host, she’s incredibly friendly, accommodating and laid back. The apartment itself is beautifully decorated and has such a good vibe. The room is spacious including a desk and large closet. The bed was super comfy with top quality linen. The bedroom was away from the common areas but next to the bathroom which was convenient. Overall the apartment was amazing and clean - highly recommended."
2015-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Phoebe,"This is a very beautiful home and we felt very comfortable staying here. We met Naveen and Tristan as our paths crossed briefly during our stay, yet this was no hindrance and it was lovely to come and go as we pleased and still feel so welcome. 

Felix is a massive draw card (if you like dogs/animals) and was a delight to come home to each time!

The room is lovely, the bed very comfortable and the amenities well maintained. Overall it is a great example of quality Airbnb accommodation.

Location-wise it is fabulous. Wonderfully close to many of Sydney's highlights and with instant access to great coffee, food and bars. 
It is on a main road and a stone's throw from Kings Cross, so be aware that if you are a light sleeper you will need earplugs to help reduce the noise. However, this doesn't diminish the appeal of the place but rather just something to be prepared for.

We would happily stay here again whenever we are in Sydney and highly recommend it to all fellow Airbnb-ers.

Upon my arrival, David showed me around and he had even put together a scrapbook with recommendations on places to eat! The apartment is exactly like what you see in the pictures. It was very clean and everything that you could possibly need to make your stay as comfortable is provided! There are a couple of nice cafés near surry hills and oxford street. It takes just a straight bus to the cbd or to the beach! David is a very nice person and it is safe to stay there for solo travelers. I highly recommend his place!

Very friendly and helpful hosts who were great at communicating and made us feel very welcome. We would definitely stay there again! "
2016-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Rebecca,"Susan provided us with specific information and demonstrated a caring, sharing attitude. The room itself was cosy with a private ensuite. We are familiar with Leichhardt and knew of the plane noise but apart from that, the area was relatively quiet. Thank you Susan! "
2018-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Sandra,"Tracey’s place was stylishly decorated with lots of thoughtful touches. It was perfect for a special night away for a couple. Close to some great cafes and restaurants and train was a short walk away. Tracey provides lots of info on the local area including maps which was helpful. 
Thanks for having us. It was a perfect weekend."

The kitchen is stock up with all sort of food and seasoning. 
Thank you, Linda."

Margaret is a generous host who respects your privacy yet unobtrusively ensures that you have everything that is needed, including generous breakfast provisions.
We stayed several weeks whilst waiting to move into our new home and although the bathroom and kitchen are compact they are functional and we soon adapted to cooking and boiling water for washing up in the indoor/ outdoor kitchen. The shower has plenty of hot water but once again is compact. The bed is comfortable and the living area quite spacious. Train enthusiasts will particularly enjoy checking out the many original artifacts that decorate the spaces. 
The accommodation is located a few kilometres from the train station so a car is recommended. There are some beautiful bushland walks leading to the George's River that are well worth exploring and Sydney is about 50 minutes by train.
We would highly recommend Margaret's place, especially for short stays. We loved the convenience of being close to everything yet being on the edge of bushland and the river. We also enjoyed interacting with Margaret's three dogs that live on the property and look forward to returning when we return to the area."
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Theo,This is THE garden oasis if you want to stay anywhere near marrickville. Really comfy bed delightful space easy parking plus breakfast. You do need to climb the ladder to bed (and down in the morning) but the space and facilities are superb. A real treasure.

We loved the ginger biscuits, & freshly baked bread, that Cath handed to us in the morning, still warm from the oven. Cath was approachable & helpful when we needed info on how to get around, but at the same time, gave us the space we needed. Her chickens too, were rather welcoming! A joy to talk to; we appreciated the short exchanges & enjoyed listening to her share bits about herself :) 

A gem of a place!

2017-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Bao,Susan and Greg were excellent and inviting hosts.  My stay here was wonderful and over & beyond what I had expected.  Staying at this studio bed and breakfast was a 10/10.  Here you will have peace and quiet with a lush & scenic backdrop.  You will have all the amenities to live comfortably as well as all the amenities needed going to the beach.  They've thought of everything!
2017-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Adriano,It was an absolutely lovely stay with my family at Fred&Bernadette fantastic place. We were so lucky because we've booked at the same morning when we arrived and everything was just perfect even they had guests before.Location is fantastic the bus to the city in front of the door and the flat and Fred&Bernadette are just beautiful.A beach in front of the door what else do u need for an unforgettable stay in Sydney!! You can see the love to the details and will not regret to stay with them.Thanks for that and the tasty welcome gifts.
2017-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,15889399,Lee,Such a lovely space that felt very cosy and private. Location is amazing as there are a couple cafes to choose from and a train station 5 min walk away. Steven and his family are beautiful and were very easy to get along with. They keep everything in perfect condition.

2014-09-03T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Farmer,"I had an excellent experience staying at Hernan's place. He was very welcoming and friendly, and helped me making taxi arrangements, and made sure I was up early for my taxi to the airport. His apartment was comfortable and clean. Just up the road is a good place to find something to eat. I didn't have time to check out the nearby beach. The place is close to Sydney airport. A taxi ride during peak hour, from the airport to Hernan's, was around $41. It was significantly cheaper in the early morning, going to the airport."

2017-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Simon,"The flat location is good in central Sydney and convenient for walking. The flat facilities are basically in ok condition, but more care needs to be taken over plumbing in the bathroom sink and muffling of noise from the street outside, as the bedroom windows look upon the street and one of the windows' latch handles was missing, so it could not be closed (this meant more noise but also a lot of the summer heat entering the flat)."
2016-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Sue,"A lovely, modern, beautifully decorated apartment within easy walking distance of North Avalon Beach. Very comfortable bed and gorgeous bathroom(s)."

2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,16654584,Linda,This cosy little cottage is in a fabulous location with so many dining options near by and a short walk to the ferry.

The room is very cosy and just 5 minutes from the ferry wharf to get you to the city center. 
We had a lovely stay there and would definitely go back :)"
2016-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Chad,Shuang's place was great. It had everything I needed for the Stay and was very clean. I had a small problem with the iron but Shuang had it fixed within minutes! Would definitely recommend.

2017-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Brenda,"David's place in wonderful in all aspects. A real oasis in the middle of a busy, beautiful city.

2016-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Shen Leng,Love the space and privacy of the cabin. It was so comfortable and cosy I took my time to get ready every morning and never left the cabin until 11am. Great for a solo retreat! Susan was a great hostess and I enjoyed my conversation with her.
2014-04-21T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Rudyard,"Once I mastered the bus system, I realized how easy it was to get to Arnie's Victorian home. 
The room assigned to me was spacious; however the bedsprings of the antique bed creaked, and made me paranoid about disturbing the rest of the occupants of the house (and other guests). After a long day exploring the city, the creaking bedsprings did not bother me as much on the second night.
The bathroom is up another set of stairs, but clean and spacious too.
Arnie was very helpful when I discovered I had lost the key to my luggage, and I really appreciated that.
The house itself is filled with Victoriana and of Arnie's large paintings.
The neighborhood of Paddington is very boutiquey and fun to wander through.  There are a number of bookshops (which I love) and many furniture and clothes stores. Went to a couple of cafes for breakfast in the neighborhood; the food was reasonably priced and the coffee was great.
All in all, a different and attractive face to Sydney, than what I was used to. I'm glad I chose this home on this Sydney visit."
2017-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Gustavo,Great location in a very old building. The apartment has been renovated but has some problems... The building itself is very old and not nice. And the shower is a bit disappointing... Overall a good stay.

Clean bedding (like a hotel), towels and clean bathroom.
Photos aren't quite the same as the property. It's quite aged and in need of a good clean or complete renovation."
2016-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Andrew,"Where do we begin? Desireé is a wonderfully thoughtful host that made our stay so special. The apartment looks exactly as pictured - modern, comfortable and clean. The location is fabulous and central to everything! This apartment does not disappoint! Our only regret is that we didn't stay for longer. We will certainly be back the next time we are in Sydney! Thank you Desireé!"

Seriously Cath has provided the most thoughtful services, she even personally got us fresh Bread in the morning and Jam donuts too! The place is filled with everything that we need, more than we even expected.
She has done such amazing work with a small space, it's functional and we just love the layout and modern design aesthetics! Cutest Studio we've ever stayed in!
Thanks Cath!"
2017-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,8106459,Anders,"My parents stayed in this apartment and here is what they had to say: ""Our stay in Brendas apartment was terrific! Brenda herself greeted us and gave us helpful hints and a tour of her stylish home. We were impressed by the lovely white towels,  lovely bedlinen and even beachtowels for us to use, very thoughtful as we came all the way from Sweden! We loved the very nice and spacious home, which we quickly felt was cozy and easy to relax in. The apartment is tastefully furnished and decorated with Art Deco from the smallest items, furniture and lamps as well as interesting art. We had breakfast, lunch and dinners on the fantastic green and shaded terrace where we even could catch a glimps of Coogee Beach!
 
Our stay in Sydney after Christmas was terrific, including precious family time with our two sons and their partners, as well as friends who also could stay in the extra bedroom. New Years Eve was celebrated on the terrace where we had a great view of the fireworks in Coogee. We could easily find the shops closeby and nice walks in the surroundings. Buses and subway took us around in Sydney in no time!
 
We are happy to recommend Brenda as a friendly and trusting host and who knows, we might be back again soon!?"""
2019-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Lora,Phillip’s place is beautiful and in the perfect location. It is walking distance to bus and train stations. It location near the grocery store and bottle store. This place is perfect for couples or a group of friends.  We enjoyed cooking a couple of nights and a few night lounging on the large couch and watching local tv shows. If you don’t mind a few stairs... this is the place to stay.
2018-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,23106836,Abinaja,"Judy's place is very accurate to the listing. It was sparkling clean and the check-in process was so easy. Very nice location if you want to get away from the city a bit, but still very close to the train station. There are quite a few guests at the place, but they are not intrusive at all. 

Overall, would definitely recommend! "
2018-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Cheng Yue,Duncan and Ashlee were excellent hosts. My daughter and I enjoyed staying in their super clean and tasteful home. It is our home away from home! Highly recommended!

All of Sydney’s attractions are within walking distance but public transport is good, we got buses into town and got the train and bus to Bondi Beach. We loved having breakfast looking out of the window at the passers by in the street. Great place!"

Quick walk to a local off leash dog park too!  The beach, bars and restaurants are all on your doorstep and the bus stops right out front!  Cannot be beaten for the location!

2016-07-19T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Madeleine,"Thank you Belinda and Chris for making your beautiful garden studio available for stays. Divine! We had a fabulous time. The studio had everything we needed, great kitchen set up so we could prepare two yummy simple meals, and a lovely little verandah into the garden to enjoy our leisurely breakfasts. Your studio in located only a minutes walk to the best little beach and so close to stunning cliff tops walks in the Royal Nat Park. We had absolute privacy for out stay - which was lovely. Thank you for such a welcoming, private and cosy sanctuary."
2017-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Ian,"This place was bigger than expected, had plenty of hot water, fully functional kitchen, and close to 3 grocery stores, lots of places to eat, and transit stops.  David is a great host, left tea, coffee, cereal, dish soap, etc. to use. There is one portable heater so rooms got chilly without the heater but there are extra blankets. Bring slippers. Definitely noisy in the living room at night from people in the corridor downstairs and the queen bed was quite bouncy. However, it was the perfect spot for our stay, we were quite happy."

2018-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,23510317,Robert,"This apartment has so much potential but as it is now just didn’t work for us. We visited during a time where the weather was 90F degrees and the “air conditioning” isn’t air conditioning at all. It is a standing unit where you must keep the sliding door open 8-10 inches all day/night if you want to use it, thus defeating the purpose and letting all the hot air in. It made the loft unbearable. So much so that we had to sleep downstairs on the couch and air mattress. The bathroom was nice and it has a full kitchen and washer. Those are the nice things I can say. Check in was easy and he accommodated us early which we appreciated. David (who we were in contact with) did try to help us but there were just too many problems. The WiFi worked 20% of the time we were present - he blamed it on us using too much bandwidth - we were simply trying to connect an iPhone to the internet and to text - not stream movies or download anything. The beds were uncomfortable but the place would be a good value if the WiFi worked and if it had actual air conditioning as advertised and how the pictures lead you to believe. Because we had to keep the door open (security risk) so many bugs, spiders, etc. came in too. Also the smoke detectors are covered in aluminum foil which is a safety risk. I would not recommend this Airbnb to anyone at its present state but it could be great for the cost and for bigger groups as it sleeps 5-6 somewhat comfortably. Our stay, however, was not pleasant at all and we could not wait to leave."
2017-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Michelle,"Simon & Nicole's Airbnb was great! 

Apartment was clean, had an awesome shower, comfy bed, fully equipped kitchen, even had a few little chocolates & snacks scattered thru the house. 

Location was close to shops, cafes restaurants and central station. 

Thanks so much Simon & Nicole for an fab stay in Surry Hills! "
2016-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Christopher,"Both the host and the apartment were wonderful. The apartment is very clean and well organised, with paintings and decorations around the apartment providing a soothe homely feeling. Inside the room was a wooden stand with towels, books and dvds which added a lot of personality to the apartment. The room had a nice balcony attached to it which provided a nice place to eat and relax. As well as this, the room had 2 powerboards next to the bed so everything can be plugged in and a mini-fridge next to the bed.

The host provided most of the items that you might not remember to bring with you including plates, cups, cutlery, shampoo/body wash and more. The apartment was less than a 2 minute walk from the Redfern Train Station which is just 1 stop away from central, so this was in the perfect location to do sight seeing. 

I would recommend staying at this apartment."

2018-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,24608152,Debbie,Our employees enjoyed staying at this property.  It was close to where they were working in the area and we would definitely look at booking again if the need arose.  Both Godelieve and Tam were very accommodating when we needed to extend our booking on a couple of occasions so that was very helpful to us.
2018-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,22343897,Hari,Great location close to the station and the city center. Quick response and great housemates. The cleanliness of the house was a little relaxed definitively encountered some roaches. But I would come back without a second thought

2018-03-27T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Catherine,My friend and I loved staying at MissD’s townhouse for a few nights!

House was very clean, spacious, had everything you could possibly need on a trip away and the kitchen was even stocked with extra supplies which was a real bonus!!  Beds were comfortable too.!

The apartment is just stunning. It is beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The beds were really comfortable. The apartment was so well equipped with more than we could possibly need. We really appreciated the fresh bread, fruit and variety of tea available. Angela and Geoff even organised a cot and high chair for my son so I didn't have to bring the portacot or worry about chasing him around to feed him. I wish we needed to stay longer! Highly recommended."

Regarding the location, it is not far away fron CBD. You have to take a bus or the train. During this period, it has some construction. So, you may use the replacement bus or taxi to Naveen' home.

Last but not least, I am really impress the view of Darlinghurst from our room."

Their apartment is clean, tidy and has all of those little bits and pieces that you need for a nice weekend away.
Thanks again guys!"
2018-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Julia,High recommend Jeremy's Airbnb for groups of friends who'd like to explore Sydney! Location was amazing as we were a 10 minute walk away from the city :) The space was clean and larger than I had initially expected with 4 bedrooms with some individual balconies in the terrace house. Would definitely book again for my next Sydney trip!
2015-05-16T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Patrick,"Our stay with Arnie was a pleasure. He was responsive to our messages before and during our stay. He was home when we arrived and provided great recommendations on places to visit.

The house is very well-located. Paddington is an absolutely delightful neighborhood. We enjoyed exploring the wide-range of cafes, restaurants, and stores (we definitely recommend dinner at Eat Thai). Likewise, we enjoyed having the option of a leisurely stroll down Oxford to the CBD or choosing one of at least three bus lines to whisk us quickly to our destination.

With regards to the house itself, this is certainly a property for anyone with an appreciation for art. Arnie has a well-curated collection, including many of his own works. During our stay, there was a guest in the second bedroom, but we didn't have any issues with the shared bathroom."
2017-07-01T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Kirstin,"Rachel's house is perfectly located in Mosman - close to shops, restaurants and transport. The house was exactly as in the pictures - very stylish, clean, light and airy. The beds were all very comfortable and all mod cons were available for use. Rachel was easy to communicate with and we would highly recommend staying here. "
2017-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Neil,"A lovely old house situated in a lovely part of Sydney.  Paul, Judith their dogs and their grownup kids are all wonderful people who were a real pleasure to chat with every morning over breakfast and every evening after a long day of sightseeing.  This is one of the nicest experiences I've ever had with Airbnb, keep up the great work, guys, and continue to be awesome smart classy people."
2015-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Rabea,"I really enjoyed my stay at Hernans place. I felt very welcomed and was happy about the relaxed and easy going atmosphere.
The transport was okay, easy to reach with bus or half and hour walk to the next train station. Shoping and eating was near by.
Altogether thanx so much for the wonderful stay Hernan."
2017-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Matthew,"Very comfortable home. The best mattress we have had through Airbnb! Great a/c, good kitchen and quality appliances. 
Lina and her family was very friendly. The photos don’t give the apartment justice, it’s actually quite large. Can recommend for short or long stays!"

2017-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Jacquie,"Paul is a charming and thoughtful host. He was incredibly kind and helpful and I really enjoyed our little chats. The house is in a great location in Bourke Street so really close to Surrey Hills, Centennial Park and for getting in and out the city. The room is very nice and a little away so you have your own privacy.  I would highly recommend this airbnb."
2016-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Lyn,"Location of apartment was fantastic. Walking distance to The Star, Fish Market and Darling Harbour. The apartment was also very organised and clean. Loved that there was ample sunlight that passed through the apartment. Parking space was a little tight. Recommend to get a smaller car if you intend to rent one. There are certain things to take note, response from host was not very prompt. Asked for late check out several times and only managed to receive a reply after 3 texts and emails. Parking garage was renovating the day I arrived but was not informed earlier and had to pay for parking several hours. Overall, a good experience."
2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Suzie,Cat was more than accommodating and an excellent communicator. Her house is brilliant with lovely private spaces and a quick walk to Bondi. Highly recommend :)

2016-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Vivian,"The location of the house is excellent due to its vicinity to the Maroubra beach and downtown city.  The house is spacious, good enough for a big family or a group of friends.  It's also nice that the house has lots of cooking utensils that allow you to prepare food so we can make our own food sometimes.  The host is also very nice to let us use the seasoning in the kitchen.  

The only comment of the house is a bit older than we expected and we encountered small insects inside.  The repellent that was provided in the house was useful in that case.

Overall speaking, it's a nice stay for my family."
2018-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,24460964,Gary,"Would use again if we return to Sydney and want that side of town.
Quieter than expected given right on Elizabeth St."
2018-12-23T05:00:00.000Z,30056291,Jennifer,"Such a beautiful and cosy apartment with views from the lounge/kitchen that pictures would definitely do no justice. I felt like I was at home. Nick stayed in the front bedroom but it felt like he wasn’t there at all, not until we needed his help with a hiccup trying to get the bathroom door unlocked haha. He is such a beautiful person, and I would without a doubt be recommending his beautiful place to any friends that wish to stay in the city in the future!"

The accommodation is quite good value for the money and all the amenities are available. Also one very positive thing was not mentioned in the listing that, the apartment have a small, well decorated veranda to spend time smoking, drinking and having fun or enjoying solitary time.

Naby is really warm and welcoming. She is very helpful and spent significant amount of her free time with me (she is a very busy lady with her career). I would like to visit her place again.

Thank you Naby !!! Hope to see you again. "

We had a little issue the first day when the electric tripped (the fuse box is in the wardrobe) but Millie’s friend Shelly and Millie were both so helpful and attentive it didn’t matter! The bed is super comfy and she has everything you could possibly need.
The view from the balcony really is the same as the pictures- it’s incredible! 
I would highly recommend this apartment and wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again!

Vi fick inte information om det inte fanns 5 sängar.
Nödlösningen med en luftmadrass var inte acceptabelt.
Lägenhetens läge var utmärkt 
Heltäckningsmatta i lägenheten är inte bra då den kräver en extremt god städning vilket kan ifrågasättas eftersom det låg så mycket med damm på kylskåpet i köket och köket är helt integrerat med vardagsrummet. De 2 sovrummen var helt ok men det var nästan omöjligt att få utrymme i vardagsrummet med den uppblåsbara luftmadrassen, som inte kan sägas vara en säng utan en NÖDLÖSNING. Lägenheten skall inte hyras ut till 5 personer, för 4 personer är den OK"

When we arrived the place was a bit dirty but that wasn't Trents fault because he had been awayand his apartment had been out for lease.
And he made a really good job with fixing everything so we could have a happy stay!
And we did:)

The location is great and the apartment is lovely:)
The room is pretty small but it didn't bother us at all.

Can recommend this place to anyone, close to Bondi and to small hidden beautiful beaches around the coastline."

We really enjoyed days and never forget our memory in here. Room is very clean and all stuff we need are prepared in a room. I think it is ok to bring your personal things like a clothes.

And this room has a very nice view of Bondi beach.

If you want to have a good memory in Bondi beach, I strongly recommend Anita's room. 

Thank you so much for your help, Anita! :)"
2015-08-07T04:00:00.000Z,1131054,Wendy,"I loved the apartment from the minute I parked the car in the car park. The entrance has been decorated beautifully and it takes your breath away. The apartment is upstairs and above a retail shop although you wouldn't know it. 
It is incredibly spacious, but cosy at the same time. 
The interior decoration is gorgeous and inviting plus it makes you feel like you are at home. The location is just fabulous and caters for everything. Local cafes for coffee in the morning, restaurants for dinner are walking distance, great retail shopping and local delicatessens. 
Centennial Park which is a great place to relax. 
and finally, when I arrived I found that Louise had left me fresh bread, a bottle of wine and some beautiful flowers. 
I would definitely recommend this property and would stay there again."

2016-06-21T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Emma,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was absolutely perfect! 

A huge thank you to Diana and Jared, who are were excellent hosts - communicative, thoughtful and warm.  I was made to feel incredibly comfortable in their home and I loved every bit of my stay.  Diana gave me clear instructions on how to find the place and communicated really well in the lead up to my arrival, making the transition smooth and stress free. 

I loved the little touches.  There were chocolates and water left out on the bed, milk and juice in the fridge and beautiful candles lit for my arrival.  I immediately felt right at home.  

The unit is modern, comfortable and in a truly amazing location.  The Rouse Hill shopping precinct has every shop you would need and you literally step out the door and you are right in the thick of it.  

The furnishings are modern yet comfortable, and the property is equipped with all the little things that you need for a week away (everything from laundry powder to salt & pepper shakers).  

Thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality guys!

Room is as you see in the photo and very tastefully done. quality bedding, loved the floor tiles in the bathroom, leafy garden to enjoy quiet time and reading. Friendly cat sits on your lap. Beware of mozzies though. I am usually the last person to get bitten, but I attracted plenty in the garden. The suburb,shops and Tamarama beach has ""local"" feel and lot less commercial than places like Bondi and Coogee. Easy bus ride to Bondi junction and city. Very nice coastal walk we enjoyed.

2017-05-16T04:00:00.000Z,18082902,Wendy,"My guest Nick said:
My stay in Forest Lodge was all smooth sailing. The apartment was clean and had everything you needed. Cedric was quick to respond to messages and happy to help. It was easy walking distance to Suburbs like Chippendale, Glebe and Broadway. And the chocolate croissant from Goose Bakery down the street was worth writing about too. "
2018-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,8392955,Joel,"The house was amazing, even better than the photos make it look. In particular the backyard was very nice and private. The location was also great -  within walking distance of Manly beach and the wharf, making it easy to get into the city via the ferry. The three bathrooms was good to have. It should be noted that as the house has four levels there are quite a few stairs. Helen was very friendly and responsive."
2017-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Christopher,"Everything was just great! It is a cozy little apartment near the Sydney center. Clean and you got everything you need for your stay. Public transport is basically in front of your door. Next time we are in Sydney, we would love to come back! Thank you for letting us stay in your home! "

Thank you!"
2018-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,22378312,Jeroen,Lachlan is a great host! Easy to contact and quick responses. The apartment is amazing to stay in. Close to all you need and far away to have a peaceful stay. Definitely a recommendation to enjoy your stay in Sydney!
2016-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Ayya,"Beautiful townhouse located in the quieter and residential side of Darlinghurst, with walking distance to many resources and tourist destinations. We were wowed the moment we walked in the stylish  and space-savvy apartment, and welcomed warmly by Philip's very kind friends, Trevor and Sally, who also kindly bid us farewell. 

The apartment were well equipped, with everything you need to feel at home. As there was six of us staying here, the bonus were the three showers and bathrooms.

We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Philip's apartment."
2018-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,16261574,Jazzmine,"Loved this place! Although a little far from the main city area the view was absolutely amazing! The place is extremely quiet, and it has everything you need for a short stay. There is a convenient store downstairs that stays open pretty late, and there is everything in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) include laundry detergent. Jennifer made the check in process super easy, and explained the directions in detail, so I knew where to go! Whenever I had a question she also replied extremely fast!!"
2017-06-14T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Linda,"My family had a wonderful stay in Vanessa’s house – it was the most charming houses we have ever stayed in! Everything is as depicted in the description and photos – large house with lots of roaming spaces and a well-equipped kitchen. We spent most of our time at home admiring her decoration and her books collection. It’s a lovely, quiet neighbourhood with everything nearby – cafes, restaurants, grocers, liquor shops, pharmacy etc. Short walk to the North Sydney train station, or you can also take the ferry from CBD/Darling Harbour to McMahons Point (then either a short uphill walk to the house, or a 2-min bus ride up to street if you manage to catch the half-hourly bus). Totally fuss-free check-in and check-out. As mentioned by other guests, don’t get too alarmed by the list of instructions – just take your garbage out on time and you should be fine (no pun intended lol). I would highly recommend Vanessa’s home!"
2017-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Louis,Anita's place was great for a short business stay. Would absolutely book again.
2017-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,18793287,Peter,"This is a great space in Marrickville, I was working in the area and it really suited my needs. I would not hesitate to stay again."
2016-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Cuifeng,"房间跟图片一样,离悉尼机场很近,打的10分钟不用,大约15澳元｡房间整洁干净｡到入住前shuang都给了很多指引｡到达当晚是悉尼时间10点左右,因为不熟悉路,我们是在房子对面下了车｡shuang的妈妈fen来接我们｡如果你需要在悉尼转机,这里是很不错的选择"
2014-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,781631,Victoria,"I had a great stay with Mike! He's very friendly and a wonderful host. Truly a local around Potts Point/Kings Cross neighborhoods and have great recos for food and nightlife - even knows a great $5 pizza spot! 

The apartment is clean and spacious, and the location can't be beat! Super convenient to walk into CBD or up to shops in Paddington. 

I would recommend Mike's place to anyone visiting Sydney!"
2018-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,18315277,Nick,"Convenient location on Curlewis St near the corner with Glenayr Ave.  Close to shops,  restaurants and public transport.  Apartment is located at the rear of the property so relatively quiet.  Easy check-in process.  Did not deal directly with the owner but rather through Airsorted.  A few broken light globes were replaced promptly.  TV reception was inconsistent and needs improving.   Notwithstanding this, this is a nice apartment and we would stay there again."
2014-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Gemma,"I recently stayed at Beach House, Great Mackeral with a few friends for a nice chilled out long weekend. The house exceeded all expectations. In an amazing location with a stunning view its was so nice to chill out and enjoy the peace and quiet in such a perfect setting. Clean, tidy and very homely, the house comes with everything you need (and more). Lots of outdoor space to have a bbq and eat with friends which was great. The beds were really comfortable and the tree house is very cool! To open up the doors each morning from there and see the ocean and boats was just lovely. I loved the fact that you had to get a little ferry over and use a wheelbarrow to get your shopping to the house - it all added to a little adventure away for a few days! Would highly recommend a holiday here! I cant wait to go back!"
2017-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,13320545,Emmanuel,Lots of stairs. No windows but has ample natural skylights.  The neighborhood is trendy with great transportation access.
2016-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,501382,Molly,The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2019-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,Phoebe,"Perfect location and perfectly furnished, keypad was so handy rather than having a key, quick responses from ken if I ever needed help, very nice and modern would stay here again"
2018-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,Chris,"We had a long weekend at Bundeena and thoroughly enjoyed it. Hilde went out of her way to make sure that we had everything we needed both for the 6 adults and a young baby.  Very comfortable, well designed and only a short walk to the beach, shops and club. Swimming pool was a great 30 degrees in spite of the unseasonably cold weather.  All in all would recommend it and would love to return."
2018-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,27814857,Rob & Amy,"The White House is a fabulous, chic terrace within walking distance to great restaurants, exclusive shopping as well as so many other culturally enriched experiences. 

Kerry and Adam were the perfect hosts. They met us upon arrival - which made the entry etc effortless. 

The kids loved the outside area - the backyard was a heaven-send considering you’re only 5 mins to the CBD. 

I would recommend to anyone travelling with a family - or who needs to be located close to the CBD for work or an event. 

We will be back soon!! "

2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,30412858,Sarah,"As the many attractions of Australia open, this vast apartment will give you a lifetime experience. The building is next door to the harbour and many exquisite restaurants that will light up your visit! If the hot sun bothers you too much, you can easily go to the pool that also gives you a beautiful view of the city. I recommend this homely apartment to everyone and anyone!"

2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,17624702,Keith,Perfect place for a small group. The house was very comfortable and the balcony was awesome for sunsets - you can see the Opera House and Harbour bridge. You can walk to Bondi beach in 15 and about 20-25 minutes to the heart of area on Hall Street; the walk back is uphill! Communication was great and made for an easy check-in and check-out process.
2017-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,20865085,Tina,"All goes for show when you read the tittle 'blissful bronte'! Could see the beach from our front door, such a immaculate stylish home cosy feel. Close to all the amazing cafes, 5 min walk to the beach... no worries! Jenny was helpful sweet host and answered questions we had and followed our requests. This is my first airbnb experience also and was def a great one! Would def stay here again if I return to Sydney :)"

We were lucky enough to have wonderful weather for our stay and to sit out on the gorgeous balcony and people watch whilst drinking wine and eating seafood -- well you can't get much better than that! The apartment was very spacious and the kitchen was packed with great cooking materials/utensils etc. It was a comfortable stay and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

Plenty of living area options so that everyone can find their own space. Great kitchen facilities and dining area to feed the whole family. Teenage children and young children are all well catered for with a wonderful secure private outdoor space - all safety concerns taken care of! Local shops, takeaway, wonderful sports grounds, playgrounds and beautiful bush walks just a minute’s drive away. Close to major shopping centres and public transport. An easy commute to the city yet you can wake up in the tree tops with bird song!!! 
Lucy has thought of everything to make your stay a pleasure. We will be back for sure."

The apartment presented as described, and did not disappoint.

Highly recommend."

2015-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,1321603,Kate,"We had a lovely time at Ann's place. Ann and her husband are very interesting and considerate hosts. Lots of lively conversation. A lovely brunch.  Both rooms made up for us nicely. Great communication through the booking process.

Ann and her husband met us at the ferry and upon arrival I was presented with a surprise birthday cake! How fabulous. Gluten free too for me - very thoughtful indeed. A lovely birthday card too left on the dresser. It's personal touches like this that make for a great stay.

So nice to know a bit about the history of where you're staying. Ann does a great talk on the history of the island.

If you think you'll need a little sleep in, take earplugs as the local birds get excited in the morning. A wonderful symphony to wake up to, but if you're trying to sleep...  

Dangar Island is just wonderful - we keep coming back. It is a truly special place.

We'll  come again - both to the island and would happily stay here again."

The apartment is excellent.  Spacious, stylish, nice quiet residential block, good location.  A few minutes walk to Macleay Street, pleasant 20 minute walk to the Botanic Gardens and CBD.

2017-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,16827551,Chris,A very well kept house in birchgrove and only a few minutes walk to buses into the city or a slightly longer walk to the ferry. The check in and out process was managed really well. Good size with a nice courtyard space. A pleasure to stay there.
2018-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,15923846,Julie,"The location for this property is ideal for enjoying many of Sydney's popular attractions.   You can easily walk to the harbor bridge, opera house, and circular quay.  The Rocks area where the unit is located has a vibrant community and lots of cute shops, cafes, and restaurants.  

This property would be well suited for a group of adults who are comfortable sharing space.  Two of the bedrooms must access their room by walking through an adjoining bedroom.   The common sitting area and the upstairs bath are quite small.   The bedrooms are all a nice size as is the dining area, kitchen, and downstairs bath.

Suzanna was very kind and responsive to all of our inquiries and booking was easy.  We required an early check-in and it was not a problem.  Check out was also very easy.  "

Thanks Nicole, see you in a couple of months!"

2018-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Akiko,"Great location and communication was great! I appreciate that they let us check-in early, and it was nice of them to offer to make the sofabed ready prior to our arrival. I was never offered that at other places before. Maybe a bit pricey considering space, but probably it's partially due to the sofabed being open. Many restaurants and stores nearby. We didn't cook, but wish there was a coffee maker. Overall, a great stay!"
2016-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,10213499,Natalia,"We enjoyed our stay at Tracy's house. It was spotlessly clean, and we loved swimming in her lovely pool.

We also made a new friend with her Hungarian Vizsla dog.

2017-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Shaun,Nice place with lots of sleeping arrangements. Also big TV with Netflix and Xbox. Not having a sink in the main room can be a little inconvenient for cooking. Cats were a bonus too one of whom is friendly. Nice neighborhood convenient for Norwest Business Park.
2018-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,20374683,April,"The apartment was in a great location, cheap parking only a 5 minute walk away, close to broadway shopping centre and central train station. The whole apartment was clean, tidy and had everything you needed including the little extras such as shampoo, body wash, linens etc. I couldn’t fault this apartment at all and the host was extremely good at communicating and ensuring that you were having a good experience. "
2018-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Szymon,"Great location, right in the middle of Surry Hills with cafes and restaurants within walking distance. Parking spot in the garage was great and seems to be a rarity in this location."
2017-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Amy,"Paul’s apartment is in a fantastic  location if you’re wanting easy access to everything Manly has to offer, as well as public transport to other areas of Sydney whilst still being far enough away from the hustle and bustle to enjoy some peace.

Apartment suitable for a family or two couples with two separate bedrooms.

An older style apartment but very clean and comfortable. Great value for money."

2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,22124796,Mark,"Great apartment in Central Sydney. We stayed in the apartment for almost all of July. We were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go (although we did make use of our Opal card ... Wynyard station is 2 blocks away).  Both Darling Harbour and Circular Quay are within easy walking distance. We very much enjoyed the gym, pool, and spa pool. Tam was the most responsive host we have encountered in our Airbnb stays: she usually responded within 5 minutes to any questions we had. We had one minor issue which Tam immediately resolved. The huge balcony has partial views of Darling Harbour. We will undoubtedly work  with Tam when we return to Sydney and highly recommend this apartment."
2013-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Grace & Eric,"We've stayed at a few AirBNB places now and this has been the best so far. Everything was as promised and more. The cabin is a renovated artist's studio at the back of the garden, secluded and private behind trees. Belinda, the host, was lovely and welcoming and gave us some advice for how to best take advantage of the natural surrounds and events that were on in town.

The amenities were clean and exactly like the photos. We were impressed with the host's taste in DVDs and books provided for our use. 

We caught the ferry to Cronulla for the day ($12.60 return for an adult, must have cash to pay on the boat - a bit steep but worth it) and had a wonderful time enjoying the spring fair.

All in all, the host's made our stay extremely comfortable and gave us the privacy we needed to fully enjoy our stay.

Thank you Belinda and Chris!"
2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,21612973,Angela,What a wonderful place to stay. Jackie and Martin’s hospitality was definitely a highlight and their cosy fireplace a pure delight. Highly recommended.

Gavin was very friendly, and let us come and go whenever we wanted. We didn't see him a lot, but when we did he always had time for a chat. There was some confusion about the dishes, unfortunately, but this was our first AirBnB experience and we weren't sure about the house rules."
2017-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,16549021,Amber,"Rob was friendly and so welcoming when we arrived! He gave us tips about the local places to eat and explained everything well.

His place was immaculate and spacious for our family. It's central to a lot of good spots in Cronulla and easily found. No problem getting meals delivered there. 

We'd happily stay again!"

2017-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Jenny,"We found this apartment to be really wonderful to stay in! The view is amazing (although not the water view shown in the photo, which must have been taken from the south side of the building). But wonderful all the same. The apartment faces north You can see a little bit of ocean in the distance ,beyond Manly I guess.  We looked forward to coming home to the apartment every day. So comfortable. It helps to pull the curtains a bit going out for the day so it doesn’t get too hot. There is a great cafe with friendly staff, and good coffee and food in the courtyard below.  It’s called Springtime. There is a bus-stop to shoot into town in about 7 minutes almost directly across the road. Lots of restaurants nearby including a very colourful Mexican one. 
The directions  to get in if   you are driving, need to be clearer. And it helps to know that it is on level 11  and that the attachment on the key needs to be held near a small box to make the lift go to your level. 
All in all a magnificent and thoroughly enjoyable stay, and really comfortable beds. "
2017-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Melinda,"Amazing Apartment!

2018-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,27716426,Hansel,"I would definitely recommend this to everyone who still has doubts and is looking through the reviews. There are so many good experiences that I don’t even know where to start. But let’s start with Charles, he is super accommodating and friendly. The communication with Charles is very warm and efficient, and he is also a responsible host who really cares. And the location of the house is very convenient. It’s close to everything I need plus, so many good restaurants and pubs  which I don’t really need during weekdays, but if you are a foodie, then......The house itself is clean, tidy and comfortable to stay at. I would say it feels like home, apart from my home is never this clean... All in all, I would come back again if I have the opportunity. "
2019-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,周,"The apartment is located in a great area that’s quite during the night but very convenient for us to explore Sydney. However, as we were three people we used the air mattress but it got flat quite easily and wasn’t so comfortable. Would highly recommend this apartment for two or single travelers!"

Thank you again 
Hope to see you again soon!"
2017-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Brenda,"When I go back to Sydney, I will definitely stay at 41 Roscoe Street, Bondi again. It is an inviting and warm environment, and my hosts, Craige & Leonie were absolutely respectful of my privacy but on hand for anything I needed. It was a really a beautiful experience to be so far from home (Italy), and yet to feel so safely contained in this quiet, convenient, and beautiful house. The amenities in both room and kitchen were outstanding.  There’s an overall feeling of soft and peaceful accommodation. Just around the corner there are plenty of great places to eat or have a coffee. Bondi Beach is less than 5 minutes walk away and the scenery is hard to beat.
I can’t really find any flaws at all!  Adriano, Italy"

2018-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,2820832,Patricia,"Joanne and Sean are so welcoming and we had a truly wonderful stay in their lovely home.  

It was well located for visits to Cronulla and the lovely beaches all around and also not far from the station to make travelling into Sydney city centre easy and convenient.  Not to mention the free bus service from Woolooware station to the local rugby games at Cronulla Sharks!

The house is modern, light and airy and so very spacious - that even with 3 grandchildren and their 2 cousins who live in Caringbah  - we all enjoyed the space without falling over each other.  The pool, trampoline and play room were a big hit with the children.

It was spotless, tastefully decorated and with all amenities including a barbecue and downstairs shower room and utility room. The kitchen was well equipped - which made mealtimes a pleasure.  There were also lots of personal towels and beach towels.

A great place to stay in a quiet residential area - highly recommended."
2017-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Julieta,The place was very nice and clean. I recommend this place if you have an early start to the airport.

2016-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Charissa,Great location in Darlinghurst. Super close to Kings Cross station. Didn't get a chance to meet Naveen as we were hardly around but she was really helpful via message beforehand. Everything was in place for us. Felix is a total sweetheart and we miss him already! Will definitely stay again when in Sydney.
2016-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Peter,Cath was fantastic and the accommodation was exactly as described. Great location in a quiet street. Breaky pack was great and fresh eggs from the chickens. Thanks Cath

2016-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Roy,"Jeremy is one of the most helpful and responsive host you can have. One of our heaters was down and he brought a new one to replace the very evening after we left a message! Apart from the low water pressure on 2nd floor, everything else plus the convenient location makes the trip a notch better than it already is:) "
2018-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,22124796,Ellie,"Cute apartment, exactly like the pictures. The location was great - close to Circular Quay but also had a few cafes and a convenience store right on the same street. Very clean and convenient for anyone who wants to be in The Rocks/Circular Quay area."

Freat host and Room "
2018-06-10T04:00:00.000Z,25684995,Alex,"Super great location, very close to a range of great restaurants and bars. The apartment is quiet and old worldly but with character and modern comforts. It was the perfect combination of peace and privacy in amongst a bustling area with great nightlife "
2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Frances,"Our host made us feel very welcome. There was a bottle of wine in the fridge and a carton of milk, to get us started. The apartment located in a fabulous area...2 minute walk to a street full of great restaurants, short walk to Coogee Beach and to UNSW. The apartment is on the older side...very funky and extremely clean! Beds were comfortable and kitchen had everything we needed. There are laundry facilities as well which was very helpful for us. Only negative is that only one window had a screen on it so it didn't feel comfortable to us to sleep with them open, both from a bug angle and a safety angle since the front bedroom is right on the street. There is an air conditioner in the living room but it does not work well so it was a bit warm in the apartment. Other than that, a great experience!!"
2018-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,19574869,Jacob,This place is beautiful. The deck’s view is breathtaking and it’s a short walk to the beach. Great value for money
2017-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,18316061,Carrie,"I'll be back here again and again! It's an awesome retreat or gorgoeus alternative to another boring work hotel! Louise goes out of her way to Ensure a beautifully decorate, luxury oasis awaits all her guests with scrumptious snacks, breakfast, and all the mod cons you could want. Don't miss your chance to stay!"
2016-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Tony,This is the second time I've stayed at Kerri's place.  Kerri is a friendly and generous host who takes great care with the appearance of her beautiful home.  Easy to organise a check-in time.  Handy location only a 5 minute walk to Petersham station.   Good value.
2017-03-07T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Heike,"Great location, nice and clean, looks exactly like the pictures. "

2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,17797004,Lucy,Super convenient and comfortable place for solo travellers or couples. Easy walking distance to Redfern and Surry Hills.
2018-09-12T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Valentina,"If you’re looking for a great accomodation with spectacular service, look no further. This place is amazing for a short and long stay. I highly recommend it to everyone including pregnant women (as I am) who may feel starving in the middle of the night as there is a private kitchen that you can use at any time."
2017-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,18616850,Justine,"The house is in a great location, central to exploring many parts of Sydney. The house has everything you need to feel at home while away from home. There is plenty of equipment to cook up a meal and even laundry machines for your use. There are many great places within walking distance including eateries, shops and a great wine store. Its easy to get to the beach and to the city within a short period of time from the cottage. The cottage is cosy, and I think its notable that only one of the three bedrooms, has a door that closes. Lastly, as mentioned in another review the stairs are very narrow to get to the second and third floor, so be aware of you physical capabilities when staying here. We enjoyed our trip to Sydney very much."
2018-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,17027421,Alexandra,"This was my first experience of staying in an Airbnb & Yvonne has certainly set the bar extremely high!
We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful  house which was situated in a great location (10 min walk to Bondi) with friendly & attentive hosts who went out of their way to make us feel welcome (including driving us to our friends wedding to save us getting a taxi!) 
We had initial reservations of sharing a house rather than get an Airbnb to ourselves but these were diminished as soon as we walked in, with the hosts giving us the right balance of privacy whilst also being able to have some lovely chats (mostly when gathered around the amazing coffee machine!) 
Would thoroughly recommend to everyone & look forward to returning again soon."
2017-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Ludivine,The accommodation of Michele is very clean and very practical! The bedding is really very comfortable. Michele is an attentive host and very attentive. I highly recommend this accommodation. Also the area is great close to everything but very quiet.
2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,501382,James,Excellent host! Very responsive and helpful prior to booking. Also available to assist during stay if required (though in our case not required). Apartment very well presented and clean. Excellent location for the Kensington area and also for commuting to city; public transport very easy to manage and close by. Thank you very much. Would definitely book again.
2017-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,16087198,Micheal,"15 mins from train, good size room for someone looking for a single or few days rest.  

Host is easy to get along with and very helpful."
2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,21612973,Debra,"A very bright, modern and exceptionally clean home. Fabulous views of Manly and the Heads from your room and the living room.  The walk up from Manly Ferry is scenic but steep. ....great exercise.. the hosts Jackie and Martin are very helpful and considerate.  It is a shared bathroom and all other facilities with the hosts but wasnt a problem for us for the two nights. Would recommend this little Gem of quiet and handy location."
2012-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Bennie,"We had a fantastic stay with the mysterious DJ Walker, who is always impeccable with his sense of timing!  He is well organized, well groomed, clean and tidy with a readiness to be available over the mobile.  The place is clean, minimalist yet spacious with a splendid layout of equipment tucked away in mystical drawers and doors in neat little compartments. The design of the place is quite enchanting, and we are tempted to ask if the man himself had designed the place?!

Lovely neighborhood that is easy with get around, strong WiFi signal, with nice brekkie eateries and convenient access to public transport.  Suitably enchanted for our 8 days stay here, and proud to say that we love to call it our home, albeit a short while.  Will definitely ask to come back again if we were to visit Sydney!  GOD bless!"

2018-08-02T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Faye,"This is a beautiful 2 bedroom granny flat, really well presented, amazing view of the sunset.  Hosts were great communicators.  Everything was documented and really easy. Location perfect for castle hill, norwest or seven hills.  A steep driveway and a few steps to navigate but this was also made clear.  Thanks Ali and Maryam."
2018-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Olivia,My partner and I loved our stay. Check in and out was easy and Paul got back to us straight away when we had questions. Great location. We would definitely stay here again :)

2016-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,9849915,Ottilie,"Val & Jack's place is awesome. The location couldn't be better with the most incredible views of Bondi and beyond, and they were always very generous, kind and accomodating. It's a lovely apartment with a comfy bed, decent sized room and lovely bathroom – plus a balcony made for whale & dolphin watching. Very sweet folk in a top-drawer place."
2016-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Dalia,"Couldn't recommend this property more highly. Hosts were attentive, lovely and on the ball. Apartment was light, spacious even for two adults and three big boys! The absolute highlight though was the view of breathtaking Tamarama and being able to step across the road and into Sydneys' incredible beach culture. We felt like locals and will be back for sure.

2018-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Katrina,Great little apartment for our family. Close to public transport and funky cafes. We also loved the swimming pool facilities. Wendy replies to all messages so incredibly fast as well. We loved Sydney - thank you
2017-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Laurie,Belinda did not disappoint...Bundeena a snails pace away from the more raving Cronulla. Stay and renergise as you explore Jibbon and the National Park. It is  a secluded little garden paradise and as restful as you wish to make it. Perfect for a getaway.
2016-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Grace,"Marcella was a wonderful host who was very accommodating to our needs and always tried to be flexible with check-in and check-out. The place is lovely, it was perfect for our big group and we all had a wonderful time there. And so close to the beach! We felt very welcome during our stay and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place for a group in Sydney. "
2019-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Trudy,"Perfect location very close to the beach. House & bathroom was spotlessly clean. Coming from Cairns I didn't think I would need an air conditioned room. Unfortunately my week of stay was during a heatwave in Sydney so the room was very hot to sleep in, but comfortable nevertheless"
2017-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Lai Yi,"Danny's place is very close to Darling Harbour and about 10-15 minutes walk to China town. There are a few convenience shops nearby and supermarkets are within 5-10 minutes walk. Food is not a problem at all as Nando's is right opposite of the road and there are cafes within 1-2 minutes walk. Despite being in a prime location, this apartment is located on a quiet street so sleep is not much of a problem. We are a family of 6 adults and 1 toddler and everyone enjoyed the stay."
2019-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,17944310,Siddharth,We found the place very clean and communication was very prompt for us to take quick decisions on the last moment.

Highly recommended."
2014-12-12T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Kevin,Stylish apartment with a lovely dog. This place is awesome and it is super clean and convenient. Highly recommend everyone to consider this place when browsing in Airbnb.
2017-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Cheryl,"The place is well located, close to food and amenities, and within a short walking distance to the quay.  Jared responded very quickly and key collection was easy and efficient. 

Only issue we had was noise.  The pub opposite was blasting loud music, especially on Saturday night, till 12:30am.  Street noise starts in the mornings.  

The facilities in the apartment are complete and comfortable."
2016-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Laura,"This is the second time I've booked Jeremy's place. He is punctual in responding to queries and always so helpful and polite.
The area is perfect and the house clean, spacious and has pretty much everything you need. My family loved staying here. Great coffees at the Rusty Rabbit on the corner too!
Id book again in a heart beat.
Thanks again Jeremy. "

2018-11-07T05:00:00.000Z,20906161,Alyssa,Cozy little place literally right next to Central Station.  Alexey was quick at responding and the early check in was also so helpful. Loved the balcony!

The check in is easy, and Lucy and David are great responsive host.

2018-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Grant,"I would firstly recommend all future guest to contact Jennifer 24hrs prior to discuss your arrival time and access. We contacted host 2hrs prior without response (all available forms) until we contacted Airbnb (1hr) to support. This left is suspecting we may need an alternate location, which I’m sure was never the case (got hold 20 minutes before checkin). It would have been the hosts normal style (my perception). The access to the apartment using the instructions we were provided which were on a weekend, meant we needed to follow someone else in to gain access to the security building (hint you can walk through the Vietnamese restaurant if it is open). Also the instruction to get the key were insufficient as there was no information about where the letterboxes are (hint they are located in the middle of the entire building hint which is outside the gym) also to find the key once you locate the letterboxes (hint the key was attached to sticky tape inside the locked letterbox). This treasure hunt is fun if you enjoy puzzles. However If it is raining and you’re in a rush, this is not desirable. The place is in a great location and proximity to events and the views are certainly amazing. The pictures of the spaces are not current and some wear and tear (expected from time to time) is evident (texta marks on tv cabinet which sadly I suspect are from previous guests with kids). The couch has been torn (again sadly for host, probably from a prior guest). The shower required more effort cleaning (visible module in grout) and the drainage is poor as it filled the shower area which overflows into the main bathroom area. For any future guests who choose to stay here for any length of stay, I would recommend that you bring your own things like dishwasher tablets etc. I am confident if these few things are reviewed by the host, this place would receive more favourable reviews and increase its utilisation / price. "
2018-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Kelsey,Great spot if you have an early plane ride to catch! 10/10 would stay there again

Fresh orange and complementary tea, coffee and breakfast cereal, little touches like this make such a difference! Fantastic little beach cafe minutes from apartment is a must! Great find and if we are lucky enough to visit Australia again would definately book in future as we ran out of time to see all that Sydney has to offer!!!

2018-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,19641701,Justin,Location was perfect for what we needed.  Nice neighborhood away from the main city.  Walking distance from the harbor which took us to and from Circular Quay.

The apartment was very quiet, rarely heard any traffic or other people.  As per pics it was nicely decorated.  There is a small but nice rooftop pool which got a little busy with children (ours included) in the afternoon.  There was also a rooftop BBQ together with stunning views would be a nice way to spend the evening if desired. It was extremely convenient to all modes of transport and many Sydney sights. All in all, I would highly recommend this apartment and Chloe as a host and we look forward to returning to Chloe's apartment next year."
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,Scott,"Rooms are extremely small, the photos on the listing are a little deceiving. The place is fairly close to a few little shops. It is newly renovated and modern but overall the stay was fairly average."

2015-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Jessica,"A great stay, in a beautiful part of the world! Thanks so much for your hospitality Belinda. The studio was perfect, fitted with all the mod-cons to make for a comfortable stay. "
2018-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Pam,"Comfortable, sparkling clean, thoughtfully decorated, small but perfectly formed with lots of appreciated added touches."
2015-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Pasha,"Very easy to find house with easy access to beach and nearby amenities. 
Keys provided so we were able to  move in without any hassle. all bedding was clean. 
i was concerned about 10 adults all staying on one place, the bedroom space was excellent with everyone having enough room at night, however the living space is small and we were not able to sit together anywhere in one room which was a shame as it was a special family get together - i recommend not too many adults because of this. - dining space max 6 people. limited outdoor space to sit and eat. 
besides this, it was a great opportunity to have time with people we hadn't seen for a very long time and this made up for it all
thanks"
2013-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Amy,"Belinda and her husband were warm and friendly hosts during our stay and the clean, beautifully designed and cosey but spacious studio was everything we could have wanted for a quiet weekend away. We enjoyed watching the sunset at Port Hacking, a lovely dock across the road from Belinda's home and driving further south through the National Park. Highly Recommended for a relaxing weekend trip just an hour away from Sydney."
2017-01-31T05:00:00.000Z,7920463,Albert,"I had a great stay at Konrad and Mish places. They're lovely and friendly people and gave me plenty of advice on what to see and do in and around Sydney. The place is like advertised, so comfy room , nice bathroom and great kitchen.

I would suggest to have a car , as the transit system in this particular area is not great. Also be aware that the room can be really hot on warm days!

But it's still a great place to stay ;)"
2015-10-16T04:00:00.000Z,5116907,Danielle,"A lovely apartment in a great location, Anthony's place was perfect for me. Tucked away in a lovely quiet part of Bondi, it's a 15-minute walk to the beach and seconds to the bus stop to head into the city. The apartment is clean, modern and well maintained. I had a fantastic stay at Anthony's place in Bondi. "
2014-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Lisa,"Everything was very nice. Its super easy to get to the airport and the beach is very close. There is also a kiosk nearby.
I would definetly stay here again, when Im in Sydney. Cause Hernan was a great host."

2017-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,9848595,Lucien,"We had a wonderful stay in Charles & Gioia´s very nice and convenient apartment. Cleanness at arrival and equipment as described made life easy, also in respect of near shops, restaurants and bus stops to reach Manly. Communication with Charles was easy too and we would highly recommend that flat, even if its actualized daily rates may appear to be slightly too high for Fairlight. "
2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Tobi,"Great as always, it was our second time stay at Shuang’s place. Close to Sydney Airport. We will be back"

George and Lucia were very helpful with any questions and made it a wonderful experience.
They were wonderful hosts, easy to communicate with and always happy to offer help or assistance!
Their granny flat is very private and a little oasis in Sydney, with shops, trains and facilities a quick walk away! Perfect for any travellers needs! 

We really enjoyed staying there!"

2017-11-05T04:00:00.000Z,13595339,Rebecca,Our stay was fantastic! Great and fun neighbourhood with a grocery store just one block away (great for when you want to cook your own food) but also lots of restaurants to choose from (even farmers market on the weekend). The accommodation was spotless and perfect for two people!
2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,22362742,Kelsey,I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this property. It is close to many excellent places to eat and walking distance to do many landmarks meant that it was perfect for us. Thanks Eleni!
2018-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Vicky,"Gorgeous little studio set in amazing gardens. Bronte beach and some lovely cafes are only a short walk away. Susan and her husband were great hosts, making us feel very at home!"

2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Rebecca,We loved our stay in Paul's apartment and found it a great base to explore the galleries of Sydney. The apartment is just as described and the neighbourhood is perfect if u enjoy great food and interesting people. We would definitely book in again!
2018-04-30T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,John,"I had my family stay here for 4 days due to my wedding. Location is great and the place is a good size for a large group.

When we arrived the place smelled of mould/mildew and very stuffy. It needed to be aired out for 2 days to be acceptable. There were dehumidifiers (3) in the rooms running when we arrived to remove moisture I assume. 

I opted not to stay there on the eve of my wedding (which I planned to) due to the mildew smell but they coped with it (being  from interstate ) and it was ok half way through their stay after they left the doors and windows open for 2 days. 

The host was very understanding, sent a property manager to inspect and offered me a partial refund however this ultimately isn’t a solution and it was too hard to move everyone."
2016-05-22T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Steve,"Rachel's home was certainly ""Idyllic"". 4 of us were accommodated most comfortably across the two large bedrooms upstairs and one single downstairs. The walking proximity to Military Road shops and laneway cafe's was very convenient. We even popped in to the free public Mosman Art Gallery at the end of the street. We chose Rachel's home for its location - close to the Georges Head venue of a family wedding, accessible to the City and easy driving to and from the airport. We had a car, so the off street parking was welcome - parking on the street was at a premium. The home was represented accurately in all photo's and the description. I also enjoyed tickling the ivories of the baby grand! Although we didn't meet Rachel, she was a great communicator and all the arrangements she made for our arrival and during the stay went off without a hitch. Thanks. We would choose this place again if we find ourselves on the North side of Sydney."
2018-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,10213499,Joel,Great space and host. Loved our greeting from Sari on arrival. Will definitely stay again
2017-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Fiona,Very interesting home. Lots of books. Bedding was excellent. Great value and convenient. Great communication and patience from host as I had a few issues setting up with Airbnb. Once that was sorted everything went smoothly and Marcella was very accommodating with any requests I had. Thanks heaps Marcella.
2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,4502957,Denise,"This is the most perfect Bondi location. A great spacious home with a garden and exceptional kitchen space.  Great feel and so close to shops, restaurants and the beach."
2015-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Min-Kyoo,Beautifully decorated and trendy designed house. The royal botanic garden located in walking distance. Everything is okay and convenient. Thanks Paul.

2015-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,1229797,John,The reservation was canceled 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2016-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Ruth,"Margaret had the carriage warm and ready for us with lovely supplies for breakfast and more. Although it took some juggling to prepare our meal the first evening we got into the swing of it and indoor-outdoor was part of its charm. We loved the bush surrounds (how could it be near suburbia?), the fire pit on our last night and the warmth of hospitality and conversations. Margaret went out of her way to care for our needs while respecting our privacy and space. We definitely recommend the Carriage and all the location has to offer. "
2016-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Bert,My colleagues Stefan and Mandie enjoyed the abundance space and location of this place. They assured me they will definitely be back.

2017-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Rebecca,Beautiful home set in a wonderful location. Everything that you could ask for and so much more. Thank you Rachel for being a tremendous host.
2016-03-12T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Steve,"Host was very accomodating, meeting us early to let us into the apartment after arriving from the airport. The photos don't do the apartments justice, it was very clean and the dining area over looking the street and fountain was great. The area itself has good local ammenities and some nice restraunts near by. We read on other reviews the area was quite noisy at night but we didn't find a problem with the noise, even on a friday night. Within reasonable walking distance to the botanical gardens, from which you can cut through to the opera house. All in all a great stay and would recommend to anybody looking to visit the city."
2017-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Claudio,Very nice room..clean and furnished! In a good queiet position!..and Cathy is a very good person! Recommended!!

The apartment was as described and provided every comfort we needed.
We loved the local area, lots going on in Avalon which was an easy walk away. 
The beaches are stunning and we enjoyed visits to Cottage Point and Palm Beach.
A thoroughly enjoyable holiday. Thank you."

2017-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Leonora,"Having travelled from the UK the house was a major disappointment in so many ways.  The cleanliness for a start particularly in the kitchen was quite disgusting, which probably is why we had visitors from lots of cockroaches each night!  The house had defiantly not been fumigated!  The third bedroom and ensuite bathroom should not be described as a third bedroom and the bathroom is very much a utility room with a sink and toilet.  The linen was put on the beds un-ironed and the towels were even presented to us with stains on.  The threadbare furniture in the lounge was a disgrace as was the debris in the garden.  Not an enjoyable experience at all, we couldn't wait to leave and it has defiantly put me off renting on Air B & B again."
2018-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,9701620,璐,Bryan is very hospitable.The house is very clean.The location is near Glebe tram station about 5minutes by walk.
2017-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,16408272,Angie,Chloe was a great host and the location is fabulous. We loved our weekend in the city - close to public transport and easy walking distance to circular quay. We were 3 adults and it was just enough room for us.

Having my own bathroom was fantastic, it's pretty new, with a bathtub. 
Very good WiFi in the entire house. 

Leonie and Craige are wonderful hosts. Prompt communication, easygoing, helpful and also very open! I'm happy I got to know them. 

Thank you very much!"

2016-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Melani,"Michele immediately responded to our request to stay at her place. Her place is very clean, comfortable and safe. The location is quite and relaxing, but also a few streets away busy with restaurants and plenty of coffee shops. Michele made us feel welcome. Thank you, Michele."
2018-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Regina,"The apartment is in a good location, close to the airport ($15.00 Uber) and within walking distance to eateries.  Breakfast at Grandmas 5 minutes down the road was excellent.  The Cannery is also within walking distance where you can get a bite to eat or coffee.  
I found the bed too hard but that may be personal preference whereas my husband likes hard beds.
We were unable to get the TV to work at all as there two remotes to the TV set up and looked everywhere for instructions but there wasn't any.  Eventually I called Wendy for instructions which we followed and still nothing so contacted her again, same thing, so I contacted her again and eventually she said she would send someone the next day as she thought it was too late but we said it was okay and someone came within 25 minutes.  Wendy's communication was good however she should have known about the new TV set up.  The only access to the TV was through UTube.   We were disappointed with the lack of utensils.  There was a wok to cook in and no saucepans or frypan. There no salad servers or spatula, basically just basic.  I looked in the drawers for clean tea towels and found two small cloth placemats which I used as a tea towel.  There were no sponges or dishwasher tablets.  I did find a used tea towel in the laundry but did not want to use it.  The only thing in the apartment was some tea bags which I am sure was left by the previous tenants. Every Airbnb we have stayed at has been great and provided basic cooking provisions such as oil, salt and pepper, coffee, tea, condiments etc and some hosts have been very generous and left fresh bread, fruit and other lovely delights. Not that we expect that this is what every host should provide but the basics I think is not asking too much Every Airbnb we have stayed at has provided either a Nespresso machine/ plunger or both. 2 bath towels and hand towels were provided but there was no bath mat.  It would have been nice to be provided with pool towels as we did use the pool and luckily it was hot enough on the balcony for the bath towels to dry.  Be prepared for loud bangs as tenants in the building would often let their doors bang.  It is a lovely apartment and I would stay again provided essentials etc as mentioned above were provided."
2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Nicolaus,"Super Zimmer und Haus, nur 1 Minute von der U-Bahn entfernt. Sehr freundliche Kommunikation mit Natasa. Alles sauber und angenehm. Würde wieder hier wohnen wollen! Danke! "

Nice touch with the provision of good coffee and breakfast as well"
2018-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,16885508,Janet,"Staying in this house is like staying at a private resort. The location in the quiet street with the bush right behind the house is wonderful as is the huge private deck with dining table and two beach umbrellas which protect you from the sun at any time of day. We had a lot of fun and relaxation in the lovely pool and spa. Having 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms was perfect for 2 married couples. The zoned air conditioning was very much appreciated. We also appreciated the  well-stocked kitchen which had lots of crockery, cutlery and food-prep equipment. The lounge room chairs were ultra-comfortable. Ruth left useful notes  e.g. how to work the spa. Would love to stay here again."
2016-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Puneeth,Stayed with Linda's for 2 days. Location is brilliant and the house is equipped with all required amenities. Would recommend it for both short and long term stays.
2019-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,21637487,Jennifer,Kasey was quick and helpful with all our communications. Her place is just as lovely as the photos and in a perfect location for a beach holiday. Would definitely love to stay again.

It is also very strategically located for travelling around by train, bus & on foot. 
Just relax and enjoy ~~"
2019-01-23T05:00:00.000Z,20865085,Raegan,"I loved my stay at Jenny's. In addition to the flat being as shown in the pictures and lovely, it is a short walk to the beach - a bit uphill on the way back. Jenny has thought of everything you could need to stay there and extra touches like sunscreen were much appreciated. 

Jenny always responded quickly to any messages I sent. She was flexible with my check in time as I arrived early after a long flight. 

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a place to stay in Sydney."

Highly recommend !!"
2019-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,24360345,Lisa,Everything is what you expect and satisfactory but the tv was not working for my whole stay of four nights. I’m sure they will resolve it but it did have a negative impact on my stay.

2018-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,21637487,Clare,"Kasey's apartment is beautiful! Right on the beach (yet away from the road so less noisy), and beautifully finished. Our stay was like staying in a hotel. Highly recommended."

2018-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,5224098,Rhian,"Tam’s apartment has everything you could possibly need to make your stay in Sydney feel like you’re staying in your own home. All aspects of the apartment are clean and functional, and there are special touches all over the place that elevate the experience. The location is amazing, so make sure you wander down Stanley street and check out the bars and restaurants while you’re there! 5 stars all the way ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

2017-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Rika,"Shuang's place is very clean and organized. We didnt meet him during the stay, but he responded our inquiry in time. The place is walkable to train station where you can find a shopping centre with lots of restaurants and shops. We only need 10 min to reach international airport by car."
2015-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,4499095,Isabel,"We had a lovely time during our stay in Sydney in Dino's apartment. It's a great location with a view through the trees on the harbour from the 5th floor. The area is superb with restaurants, bars and a grocery store in walking distance. The apartment itself was super modern and stylish - just what you expect from an architect - and looks just like in the pictures. We were welcomed by Rick, a friend of Dino, who is taken care of the apartment when he is away. Communication was great from both of them and we felt well taken care of. Definitely would recommend the place :)"
2015-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Ben,"Great time here, very nice self contained flat out the back, clean etc."
2015-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Serene,"Hernan's house is real close to the airport and beach. I have stay there for 1 night with my boy friend and we find the house is very nice looking and clean. Hernan also very kind and help us to book the taxi for next day, we enjoy to chit chat with him and he willing to share information with us. 
Just a little inconvenient at night because there are noises from the road traffic."
2019-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,31344231,Silke,"A tidy, modern apartment in a very convenient spot in Neutral Bay, close to shops, banks, a post office and several restaurants and cafes. We enjoyed our stay very much and would have loved to stay longer."
2018-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,Wayne,Beautiful apartment in excellent location. Faultless presentation. Anita is an excellent host & very quick to communicate when required. We had a    great weekend & would be happy to return. Can highly recommend.

2017-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Marilyn,"Stayed 2 nights in July 2017.  This lovely 1 bedder is handy to everything and was extremely neat, clean and presented beautifully.  Bedding, linen etc were beautiful and everything you could possible need in the kitchen.  Will definitely book again next time I'm in Sydney.  The hosts were great communicators and obtaining access to the accommodation was no trouble.  Parking in side street only a few meters away."

2016-11-06T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Lynn,Cozy place to stay for a few days. We had a minor issue in the apartment and Victoria was quick to respond and provided a quick fix. The location is  walking distance to the botanical garden with access to grocery store across the street and good restaurants along the street.  Would stay again if we return for a visit in the future.
2015-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,6046461,Karen,"Quedarme en el departamento de Suzie, durante mi primer fin de semana en Sydney, fue perfecto! 

Suzie me mandó con tiempo las indicaciones adecuadas para llegar a su departamento y estuvo atenta a mi llegada. Me enseñó todo lo necesario para sentirme cómoda en el edificio y me ayudó en la elección de los horarios y recorridos de los buses, del tren y de los ferrys. Fue una gran ayuda al organizar mis paseos. 

El departamento está a un paso de Darling Harbour, con restaurantes, cafés y varias atracciones. Una estación del ferry está a 5 minutos. Es un barrio muy central y accesible, muy cerca del metro y buses. 

El departamento es precioso. La pieza es tal como la muestra en su aviso y llegar a descansar a esa cama después de 8 horas de caminar por Sydney, fue el broche de oro de unos días geniales! 

Volvería feliz a Sydney y de todas maneras a ese ""lovely room""! 

Gracias Suzie! "
2016-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Kate,"Great place to stay when flying out the international airport. Great price, easy to get to airport ($12 uber). Highly recommend. "
2015-04-27T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Ray And Sheila,"This was our second stay at the Garden Studio and we were again made most welcome and comfortable.
 The studio is well equipped, spotlessly clean and Cath is a most thoughtful host."
2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,9098095,Harrison,"The rail car was the perfect get-away after four bustling days in Sydney. Margaret and John were lovely hosts -- welcoming and attentive, not a bit intrusive. Wifi was on the blink when we arrived, but my husband (on working holiday) survived the brief disconnect and I enjoyed the added serenity! Highlights of our stay included bush walks, "" brekkie with the lot"" using the fresh ingredients Margaret provided, and a relaxing day trip to the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum (Thirlmere) and Australian Botanic Garden (Mt Annan). Would love to stay again!"
2018-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,5923031,Ashleigh,"Narelle was a fabulous host, always responding quickly and made check in and check out easy.
Narelle's place was lovely. It was small, but had everything you need if you're on your own or with someone. It is close to trains and buses which take you straight into the city centre. The door blocked out most of the noise and there was a fan and air-conditioning, so if you can't handle the noise and it's hot, you can close the doors and still be cool. 
I would definitely stay again and would recommend it to anyone else travelling to Sydney."
2015-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Geoff,"David was really welcoming and the room is well appointed. The property is well renovated and designed with downstairs guest bathroom a massive bonus. 
Location is unbeatable, and I've decided to stay again. "

2018-10-18T04:00:00.000Z,24460964,Joe,"The washing machine is fantastic... Best we've experienced in over 10 Airbnb stays in Australia. Disappointed that the apartment has no microwave.  Lack of basic amenities such as paper towels, facial tissues, and wash cloths."
2017-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,6170899,David,"Well appointed, clean and tastefully decorated. Friendly and accomodating host, the complementary breakfast and wine were a bonus. Highly recommended."

2017-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Scott,"Cat's place out the back of North Bondi is literally around the corner from a hip local scene with good grocers, bar and cafe action. The house is spectacular - classy and comfortable and in excellent taste. Cat is a genuine host and communicates extremely well. If this is the size and location you need, you'll not find better."
2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Amanda,Sarah was a wonderful host.

2017-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,17438054,Mobin,"George and Lucia's Granny Flat was a great place to stay. Its new, clean and easy to reach. They were very responsive and welcoming and cared about our needs. George even gave us suggestions on how to spend our time in Sydney and took us to a shopping mall on his day off. Their place is indeed cosy and quiet and it is beautifully designed as well. I was very satisfied with my stay and I highly suggest this place if you are looking for a place in the area! 
I wish the best for this kind family hope to see them someday in my home country , Iran. "
2019-01-24T05:00:00.000Z,6170899,David,Jennifer’s place is a lovely period house in the center of Balmain. Fantastic host!
2018-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Wing Yi,"The house is extremely close to redfern Station - just less than 5 minutes walk! Very convenient , there are nice cafes and a supermarket on the walk to the redfern train station.

The house is neat and clean , well maintained , with a big doggie. Milk, bread are provided for breakfast. Utensils are free to use. Kath would tell me how to keep the kitchen and bathroom clean after use.
Can sit at the sofa in the living room and watch TV while having breakfast. 

The bedroom is well decorated and with a relaxing balcony. The room is nice scented and has a Comfy atmosphere . 

Can use the washing machine and dryer so long stay tourists need not worry about running out of clothes to wear.

However, future residents have to consider that Kath has to work and has to stay at home for Check in at evening to night on your day of arrival. 
It is not convenient for her if I change my check in time (eg postpone the check in time ) on the day of arrival.
Sometimes, there may be problems in finding the transportation and arrive later than expected , then Kath has to stay at home and wait. 
Especially for those arrived at morning / early afternoon at Sydney - have to find a locker somewhere first to store the luggage first then do some sightseeing  , or maybe is not so familiar with the new environment so a bit difficult to find the right restaurant to eat - may not arrive on time at Kath’s house.

Kath will brief me on every important points of living in her house and she respected residents’ privacy well. She is of reach by using Airbnb messages. She answers promptly and instruct clearly on the check out details.

By the way, Rusky the dog is not very active and usually lies on carpet and sofa, having his own good time ~ : )"

2018-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Peter,"Ziggy's place was exactly as advertised, along with a great orientation from Ziggy on our arrival.  Everything in the studio was of an excellent standard and the great location of one block off the Manly Corso and Manly surf beach was perfect.  Excellent value for money and we will book again for Manly/Sydney visits. A super host.  Peter"

Whenever I visit NSW I will definitely go for this house."

2018-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Annette,"It would be hard to find a more convenient space to stay, two minutes from buses, ferry and beaches in fabulous Manly.

They were very attentive and helpful hosts. The apartment was HUGE!!! photos don't do it justice. Easily hosted a group of 7 guys with ease, with heaps of room to move around. Place was clean and we'll equipped, and made me forget that I was staying at an apartment and not a hotel. The location was also top notch, and a short walk to the ivy. For the price, location and the ability to sleep 8 comfortably, this place is a godsend!!!! Thanks Danny, will definitely be coming back."

Perfect location & we look forward to staying here again soon!"
2016-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Peter,"I really enjoyed my few days stay here, recovering from jet lag so I could start work refreshed and ready to go. I was made very welcome and had everything I needed in the studio. 
The bit I enjoyed most was sitting out on the deck at night on the warm evenings listening to the 'strange' wildlife. 
The beaches are a couple of minutes in either direction and local amenities a 5 minute walk.
Hard to believe I was only an hour away from Sydney airport, it seemed a million miles away."
2017-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,15923846,Linda,Lovely large bedrooms. Kitchen is well appointed. Bathroom is lovely and modern. Very clean and tidy

2018-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,17438054,Bradley,"George and Lucia went above and beyond our expectations. It was truely the best experience that we could have had.

They were such genuine and gracious hosts which made our very first Air bnb experience one that has set high standards.

We will certainly turn to them again for accomodation for our next visit to Sydney.

I highly recommend that you experience their ‘Cozy Granny Flat’, but not so much so that we can’t get a spot in there again haha. (I’m joking of course).

But in all seriousness, the standards are that of a 5 star hotel."
2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Lisa,"Great location , large roomy spaces with eclectic furnishings and artwork to enjoy . A great house with easy walking to local restaurants and city ferry"

2017-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,19238057,Robert,"A serviceable place to spend the night, but overall very average.  We wished the ventilation was better - the night we stayed it was a little hot.  We had a small fan, but we never got comfortable.  Daniel seemed like a good guy, but he rushed through the walkthrough of the space.  The neighborhood was fine, and it was quiet at night."
2017-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,9080393,Christopher,Lina was an amazing host. She provided excellent communication and everything was super smooth from check in to checkout. She even gave us some cherry tomatoes from her garden. She is a very sweet woman and an amazing host. Highly recommend.
2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,7439246,Alberta,It is obvious that the owner has put in much love and style into their apartment and we are fortunate to be able to share it at peak times of the holiday season. The location is so convenient with the beach right across the road.

2014-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Anne-Marie,"Mags was very efficient in her communications and made accessing the apartment smooth and easy. Location is lovely and quiet, close to shops and restaurants, as well as scenic strolls around Sirius Cove. Apartment is nicely decorated and has everything you need. Bed is especially comfy. Just one note of caution - it can be quite cold on overcast winter days, as there is only one small heater in lounge room. Otherwise, we really enjoyed our stay."

2017-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,West,"Way better than the photos! So clean and well decorated. We wanted to stay a lot longer. Belinda is lovely. The linen was top quality and everything was immaculate. There was even ground coffee and a plunger. Lovely garden. We did get woken up a bit by possums galloping on the roof but that's hard to control this close to. National park!
We walked 11km to Wattamalla beach and back again, and saw Wedding Cake rock and fish jumping at the beach. Also the IGA sells liquor and isn't far away. "

The house is close to the beach about a 5 or so minute walk. Close to bars and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.
2017-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,21244482,Helen,"The Garden Flat is quite unique hidden away as it is in a wonderful jungle-like garden with many interesting features. There is a feeling of being away from the bustle of the town yet it is actually near the beach, ocean pool and the Strand.
Joseph has made the flat very comfortable with some nice extra touches to welcome travellers on arrival. We loved tucking into the local fruit.
It was so relaxing to sit eating breakfast on the deck while looking out at the garden and identifying the local bird life.
We thoroughly recommend the Garden Flat for a delightful stay in Dee Why,"

2017-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,15960997,Katie,"Terry was a lovely host and her flat is in a great location with all the amenities you need. She's incredibly friendly and it was lovely to spend some time with her in the evenings watching movies. The traffic can be a bit loud but earplugs sorted that, and her boyfriend was pretty loud the last night with his mates waking me up and keeping me awake in the middle of the night, but Terry was very apologetic for this so shouldn't happen again! Apart from the last night it was a great stay with a lovely host."

2018-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,17829178,Fan,"地理位置非常好,可以走路去中国城吃饭,也可以走路去歌剧院区域(大约3公里)｡从机场出来如果超过2人可以直接打车到这个小房子,澳币40-50刀｡因为房子是木质结构且有点年头了,隔音真的不算太好,楼上邻居的每个脚步都可以听到更不用说他邀请朋友以及放歌唱歌｡房子临街在一条还算车多的主道旁边｡Elisa回应问题非常迅速,是个蛮好的房东｡"
2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,28748403,Hai,The place is a brand new apartment.  There is a portable A/C in room which is perfect for summer heat in Sydney.

2015-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Alyssa,"First time using airbnb and Marcella's place has exceeded my expectations. Ideally located, it was quiet, yet close to everything. There was a great fenced park 2 min walk away for the kids. Well appointed, warm and homely with a fantastic library (which time did not permit me to enjoy). Would definitely recommend this place to a group of several families or friends."

Would stay there again for sure!"
2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Jessica,"The location is nice and close to Avalon, but it is a  pretty small place and wouldn't recommend it for 4 adults as it only has one bedroom and two single beds in the living room (not as pictured). The photos make it look nicer than it is, it's dark and pretty run down and there were a fair few bugs inside. The place is private which was nice and very green."
2018-08-02T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Rachael,"Great location for our short stay in Sydney at a very reasonable price! Apartment had plenty of space and was clean, lots of extra blankets and pillows  "

2015-11-04T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Beata,"My husband and I stayed at Susan's and Greg's studio over three days in early November.  When walking through the back garden towards a small building at the back, we were stunned by the subtropical beauty of its setting, with a huge purple jacaranda tree and flowering hedges.  The view from the inside towards a private outdoor dining space was no less spectacular.  

The photos of the interior were very accurate: a light, very nicely decorated and comfortable room, with a well supplied kitchenette (the bar fridge thoughtfully hidden in a cupboard blocking out any possible noise), and an en suite  bathroom. 

Both, Susan and Greg replied to our messages promptly before our arrival and were very welcoming when we got there.  At the same time, while available if needed, they left us to ourselves respecting our privacy, which was greatly appreciated.  

Susan was very generous, supplying not only maps and guides to the area, as well as her personal recommendations regarding local cafés, but leaving ample gourmet breakfast provisions in the fridge, and a surprise basket with fresh bagels, organic butter and Yarra Valley jam on our doorstep the next morning.

Its location was our original reason for choosing the studio: in the heart of stunning Bronte, within easy walk to the beaches and the annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibits along the shore between Tamarama and Bondi.  What a treat!"
2014-05-18T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Ying,Herman and Conny are super nice! They are helpful all the time and made me feel at home. I didn't plan my trip in Sydney much. They recommended me a lot fun places to visit and I had a blast. I wish I could have more time talking with them. Thank you so much for your wonderful host. I will come back!
2018-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Marj,"This is a great spot to stay, super centrally located with easy access to all you could need on holidays. Host Paul is great at communicating and keeping in touch, and we would definitely stay here again."

Highly recommend at stay in this studio."

The place is clean and tidy, Brendan also well prepared in details, like the heater and chocolates. He also showed us around and gave us useful tips, even plans for days! 

The place is close to the beach, you can have a great view from the balcony. The place is also close to the bus, which can directly to Bondi Junction, and transfer to everywhere else. 

The kitchen is also welcome to use, also provides milk and bottled water.

Overall, it is a really nice place and we really enjoyed it! Highly recommend it✪ω✪"
2019-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,12098138,Lorraine,Lizzy’s Place is fab! Amazing location with a really fab view. So easy to walk down to beach and close walk to both Bronte and Bondi. You feel like a local in this relaxing and spacious apartment. We loved it!

2018-04-30T04:00:00.000Z,21939239,Kayla,"An excellent stay in Surry Hills. The location was perfect, close (and far enough away) from the train station, and buses. The studio unit was equipped with all the necessities for a great stay. Don was a superb host - nice to be met on arrival, and he gave some great local food and coffee suggestions."
2016-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,9098095,Margaret,"A very special place, set in an Australian bush setting and a unique and interesting experience spending the night in a converted train carriage. "

2018-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,24360345,Chirag,"I think it’s a decent stay just outside of the CBD, I think it can be a perfect stay if Ian and Kelvin could make a few changes. But apart from those both the guys have been really nice and humble and quick in communication. Check in was pretty straight forward and instructions were perfect."
2017-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Diane,"We loved the Potts Point neighborhood and this apartment. Perfect for the two of us, and my niece stayed with us one night so the air mattress and extra bedding was perfect for her. Hot water shower. Foodie area, with visits to the bakery, coffee shop a few doors down, and Saturday farmers market right across the street. Buses and cabs are right in front, convenience store across the street. Hosts were out of town but extremely responsive, and Wendy who cares for the apartment was fantastic - friendly, prompt, and flexible. We would visit again and recommend!"
2016-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,12259367,Jen,"Apartment was exactly how described & the extra information given re: keys / directions to the apartment  etc was very helpful. 
Only complaint (it's a very small one) would be the lack of towels in the room. 
Good price. Good location. Clean & - lovely host! Will defo be back & have already recommended to friends & family "

2017-05-14T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Katrina,"Marcella's home is a great for a group of 10-11 people. It was great to find a home that could accommodate a big group and still provide single bed options. The house was nice and cosy, had good sized living spaces and is so close to Maroubra beach, cafes, restaurants and shops. 

Parking is competitive but thankfully Marcella has a drive-way that you can park the car in.  The electric blankets were a nice touch for those who may stay during winter. 

Our group was comfortable and had plenty of space - thanks for the great stay!"
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Arno,We have appreciated calm and serenity during our stay  the cosiness of our room and the total comfort we were expecting .

Would definitely stay here, (i'm glad we didnt book the Hughenden nearby, as for the same price this place was incredible) . The spare sunroom with its own bed for one was perfect for the 2rd person staying, and the fact there was wifi, a balcony, amazing location , what more could one ask for. Thanks Louise!"
2017-05-14T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Ruth,Beautifully appointed studio with everything you need to enjoy your time in Sydney set in a lush and inviting garden.
2018-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,19254909,Jenna,"We stayed at Shobna’s place for a week. 
Pros: inside the apartment is nice, newly renovated and modern; location is near to a good pub, bus stop and coffee shop; Shobna was open to a late check out. Cons: the block is a bit run down and has a resident horder on the ground floor, the underground car park does not fit a small van, the hot water runs out quickly in the shower, the bed stoops down in the middle, we were only provided with one front door key (and asked to pay $120 for a second key) which made it difficult given there were two of us; no iron."
2014-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,794910,Joe,Galvin was accommodating as I arrived early on a Sunday morning. The location near the central train station was fantastic for me to arrive and depart by the airport and also to go visit friends in Paramatta. The built in bench in the bedroom was very convenient for spreading out my stuff.   I liked having some good places to eat nearby. The Shakespere over on Devonshire had great food at a cheap price. If you want a great location for seeing Sydney and the surrounding neighborhoods this is the place to be.
2017-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,13363311,Nicola,"We had a wonderful stay and the flat was everything we had hoped for. The extra help with cot, pram and even toys for our 15-month old made it so easy. And the flat was in a great area with a few brunch places and restaurants nearby as well as Bondi Junction just a short bus ride away. Overall we'd highly recommend staying here. Thanks Moira!"
2017-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Diane,Wake up to the kookaburra's in this bush surrounded apartment. Would be good for those who seek the recycled look and feel.  Access not suitable for small children or us (70yo). Nice area and excellent check in communication and service. Caring owner was concerned for our car in hail storm and moved it to neighbours garage.

2017-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Jill,"Dannys apartment was in the perfect location. Everything on your doorstep. Very spacious apartment, great for girls weekend with 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms and lots of wardrobe space.

Such an easy location and I was amazed by how much thought and care was put into looking after her guest's needs. The fresh croissant for breakfast was one of my favourite parts of my stay. The chooks were very cute, as was Chips. Cath is very helpful while still being respectful of your privacy. I would definitely stay here again! "
2015-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Ciara,"Beautiful apartment with stunning views. Evelyn was very welcoming and helpful. The apartment had all the amenities we needed, location was perfect. Beautiful walks near by. We would definitely return and highly recommend to others.

2018-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Yuen,"Alexey 's house located next to the Central Station which is very convenient for all travellers. The house is clean, stylish design, with a lovely balcony, all amenities are provided. However there were little problem about the shower tap and aircon, but Alexy responded quickly and promised to fix it. So the house still highly recommended."
2018-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Jane,"Very spacious, convenient and a creative place to stay.  Easy commute and great local restaurants and cafe just a minute away.  Perfect for groups or large families wanting to stay in a stylish city pad."
2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,15332652,Zhiyuan (Ryan),"Lilian's house is a perfect place. Great location, 5 minutes walk to the Redfern train station or bus station, which can take you to almost everywhere in Sydney.  Many good restaurants and bars in 10 minutes walking distance. 
The house is super clean, tidy and stylish. The guest bedroom is very quiet, bright with natural light. The bed is also very comfortable. 
Lilian and Dave are very nice hosts, they are thoughtful, caring and easy-going.  They made me felt like being home on the first day. They are also very generous, did everything to help me when I stayed in their place. I highly recommend Lilian's place."
2018-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Emma,"The most perfect cottage! I needed somewhere quiet to do some exam study, and Belinda and Chris's place was the perfect hideaway amid lush monsteras (while being close to the ferry and shops!). It's so lovely being able to wake up and stumble into Royal National Park – a five-minute walk down the road. The space itself is tastefully decorated, private and cosy with a well-equipped kitchen. I would love to visit again! Thanks so much."
2019-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,22337456,현정,"호스트의 친절함과 빠른답변이 좋았고, 문제발생을 고려한 배려가 편하고 좋았다. 수영장 헬스장을 마음껏 이용할수 있어서 좋고, 에어컨도 시원하고 좋았다.  또 시드니 갈때 이용할수 있겠으나, 마트가 1키로를 넘게가는것은 알아둬야할 사항.^^"
2018-04-26T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Mark,"A very tidy quiet apartment,ideally suited for a couple. Good location to shops and cafe. Very handy location for any events in Sydney Olympic Park."
2019-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,24660064,Brenda,"Alert! We give honest reviews!!! This place was booked because of the location and other reviews. We came to Australia to celebrity our 25 th wedding anniversary, trip of our life!  We were checked in with Steve who was very accommodating and pleasant. He pointed out that the carpet is old but clean. It really does have ripples in it from being so old. I thought, no biggie, we can live with that. Over the course of the first 24 hours of our stay many more red flags surfaced. You cannot turn on the hot water in the kitchen if anyone is using the shower- immediately it goes cold. The oven is weird, no directions on how to use it either. The kitchen floor is not tacked down! Looks lovely in the pictures but it is just splashed down. I walked on it in my bare feet and it came up! Underneath is disgusting!  The carpet in the bedroom has a big burn mark in it, which was covered by a bath mat. The bed is hard, not comfortable at all. There was an air mattress on top of the cabinet in the bedroom but it’s too small for the bed. The couch is good looking but has painful springs poking up in 2 cushions. One odd thing is in the bedroom there are side table on either side of the bed, which is nice. The dresser is tucked into the corner, but the side table makes it impossible to open the bottom drawers of the dresser. Awkward!  The kitchen utensils were disgusting and we had to wash everything before we used it.  The cabinet under the sink is awful as well. We hope this place improves because the location is wonderful."

Our stay at this charming cottage in Bronte was very pleasant.
The place was spotless with very nice hosts that went out their way to make us welcome.
we would stay here next time and recommend it to friends.

2018-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,22362742,Joel,"This Airbnb is akin to a good hotel suite, very clean and nicely appointed. Darlinghurst is magic and this apartment puts you in the heart of it. Quiet but super central at the same time. Fabulous host, highly recommended!"
2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Shijun,"It has been a great experience staying at Wendy’s place. Checkin and checkout has been smooth. You will have the entire apartment on your own, highly recommended for budget travellers with family, there is a nice balcony too, and a swimming pool in the building (though I dont have time to try it out).

I am quite satisfied with the overall cleanliness of the space, bathroom water was warm and confortable. 

Location wise, its just a few minutes walk to bus stops which can take you to CBD area directly. 3 supermarkets nearby are just 2 busstops away too."
2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Kathleen,AMAZING! The apartment made my trip to Sydney- such a chic space in an awesome neighborhood. Am already planning my trip back!
2016-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Graham,"I'm very glad we stayed here. Close to the airport. Very clean, great hosts."
2017-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,14921505,Christy,"A wonderful spot! We had 10 adults and 5 children in our group and we all had a wonderful time! There were lots of living areas so everyone could have their own space. The private beach was a hit with the kids and adults alike. Amazing sunsets, and we kept warm with the log fire. The kitchen was on the small size for the size of the house - in saying that, I would happily return!"
2018-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,19574869,Kellie,"Ruby's apartment is all about the location - great view and terrace, a short walk from the Bondi to Bronte coast walk and Bondi / Tamarama / Bronte beaches. The apartment itself is pretty tired, but if you're more into the beach than interior design, I'm sure you'll love it."
2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,18315277,Diana,"Good location and nice flat, there is a building site and a motor garage next door which is worth mentioning as it can be noisy."
2019-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,20906942,James,"Location was great as it was near city and chinatown. However, the floor was not very clean but overall a value for money stay."
2018-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,22295401,Charlotte,We had a great stay here. Griffin is an awesome and genuine host - very helpful and attentive! It was the perfect location for us as we spent a lot of time walking and exploring all surrounding areas. It’s a compact space which Griffin has done a very good job of making very effective and had everything we could have needed. And a very comfortable bed and pillows ! Plus very good wifi
2017-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Emma,Amazing apartment and Victoria is so helpful. The area is very cool - cafes galore and some incredible restaurants. I'll be back!
2018-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,20767798,Karen,"Excellent location.  5 minutes walk to Circular Quay and 10 minutes to the Opera House with cafes and restaurants all over.  20 minutes to airport and Jared and Ana looked after our bags for the day so we could go round Sydney for the day.  Cost $8 per bag - well worth it! They also arranged a lift to the airport.  Very prompt and efficient.
Apartment was comfortable and well- equipped.  All good and will definitely stay again. 
Many thanks to Jared, Ana, Jeff and Francisco!

2012-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Mitch,"DJ was a delightful host.  His place is amazing.  It's clean, modern and much better than staying in a hotel.  Its tastefully appointed and has all the conveniences that a traveler could want, at an affordable price.  His place is ideally located on the boundaries of Surrey Hills and Darlinghurst with a bus stop just steps away.  You have access to a sunny balcony from your bedroom and the bed is quite comfortable.  DJ will give you your privacy if you want but is also quite friendly and willing to help with suggestions for meals or things to do.  I will definitely stay here again if I have the chance to return to Sydney.    "

Fred and Bernadette provided some nice basics - milk, juice and more on arrival and a very comprehensive guide to the area and the city.
We would definitely make a return visit."

The accomodation has all the facilities needed and very close to great Shops and restaurants. The attention to detail in property like the quality of duvets, towels etc is super and they kindly helped us with our very late check in! Perfect place to stay!"
2014-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Dylan,"Out-of-towners and Sydney residents alike loved this apartment and its location. I don't think anyone took their eyes off the ocean. We even had a whale watching session one afternoon, counting about 4 or 5 humpbacks making their way back down the coast for summer.

It's an easy walk to Bronte and Bondi, but with Tamarama beach right out front you don't feel like you're missing out on anything. I was coping with some jetlag, but the others were keen to explore. The apartment proved to be a valuable centre point as people did what they wished and then met up again.

The apartment itself is clean and well appointed. Definitely somewhere I'd like to spend a lot more time. We had a family gathering for my 30th birthday one night and hired a chef. He was able to deliver a number of courses from the kitchen without any worry.

We were a little worried about finding parking, but I don't think we ever failed to find a spot out front."
2017-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Daniel,"Perfect is the only appropriate word to describe this place! The design of Cath's little studio/loft is exceptional, we genuinely did not want to leave. Great central location in a beautiful leafy suburb, plenty of parking and an incredible host. Cath was so kind and helpful and her Labrador Hazelnut was just adorable. This is perfect place to base yourself to enjoy the best of Sydney - we will be back! 10/10!"

2017-04-04T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Elissa,"Paul's place is in a fantastic spot right near the wharf, beach and shops. It was perfect for us to use as a base to explore the area, and to jump on a ferry for trips to the city, the zoo and more. Our bed was very comfy and - despite being in the heart of Manly - we slept without an issue. Our kids (8 and 11) were happy to share the other bed and had great sleeps too. Thanks Paul for the prompt communications and the lovely little place."
2015-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Indrani,Belinda was warm and helpful and made my stay very easy. The description details were accurate. It was a lovely idyllic setting in the garden with a side entrance for guests. I loved everything about the place. The studio was decorated in a soothing and artistic way with Belinda's beautiful art works and tasteful furniture and other touches.   I felt like I was in a perfect forest retreat. At night I could hear frogs and crickets and then morning birds and it was lovely to sit on the verandah with tea and walk down to Jibbon Beach nearby. Simply a lovely break. Thank you!

2016-06-08T04:00:00.000Z,2889953,Anna,"Jyoti and Uttam's home is a lovely home in a quiet, friendly neighbourhood. Before I even reached the house, locals in the street gave me warm hellos! I had a car and parking on the street was no problem. A lovely location near Olympic Park, super close to Newington shops, cafes, restaurants. 
My room and bathroom were very very generous and homely and my stay was perfect and relaxing. I am really happy to have stayed with some a warm, welcoming family. A wonderful AirBnb experience! "
2014-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Georgia,"Perfect for a weekend in the Royal National Park! The studio is 100m from a private beach, close to the ferry and has everything you need for a few nights away from home. 

Belinda and Chris were lovely hosts - they were very helpful and offered us good local food and whale watching tips. "
2018-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Laura Jade,"The photos of Paul's place don't do it justice. It's bigger and nicer than it looks and right in the heart of Manly (with beach views from the kitchen). We couldn't fault a single thing. Just a heads up, parking can be tricky but Paul provides his permit and it is on the third floor which wasn't a problem for us or our three young kids but may be if you are injured or have mobility issues. We loved our stay though."
2017-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Yi,it was nice stay at vanessa s place. really convient and close to everywhere.

2018-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Claudette,The apartment was very spacious and in a great location to walk to both the beach and the wharf. Paul was very swift with communication however we would have appreciated a heads up about the building work next door. Great value for such a central location - the bathroom and kitchen are very outdated but work just fine
2017-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,8277472,Lorraine,"Awesome location with hosts who offer excellent hospitality. They are generous with their efforts in comfort and companionship if you want it, and they have excellent knowledge on Sydney plus locations around the world. A top little find!"

The view from the top bedroom is amazing, overlooking the city. 

The house is very clean and tidy! The rooms are spacious and stylish. It has everything you need and we felt extremely spoilt on our weekend away.

Jeremy is a great host, easy to contact, accommodating and always gave a quick response to my queries. Thanks again!

The terrace is very well located, close to everything, in the heart of Darlinghurst. 

Thank you Jeremy for everything, we hope to be back soon."

It was very sunny these days but there is a fan to solve it. It's a noisy street but you can close the windows. And don't worry about strange people walking around, they don't cause problems"

2017-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,888107,Mark,"First of all, i wanted to talk about Annandale Village. My wife and i loved the place. It's a very quiet village with friendly people and lots of options for food and coffee. It is not too far from CBD and if you want a quiet/peaceful environment, Annandale is the perfect location.

Wyatt's place- we loved staying at Wyatt's home. We didn't get to meet Wyatt and Julie as they were travelling during our stay. Erika hosted us instead. She was very helpful and accomodating. The house is literally less than a minute to the bus stop (470 to the City and 370 to Cogee Beach).  The location is just 15 to 20 minutes to the City. Very convenient. We enjoyed our stay at Wyatt's place. There's a rustic, homey feel to it. The room, although small is just about right for my wife and myself. We even spent 1 day just being lazy in the room and drinking coffee in the balcony.  I will not hesitate booking the same room on our next visit to Sydney. I recommend Wyatt's place and please read his instructions first so you would know what to expect. All in all, we had a great stay in Sydney and our trip was made even more memorable by staying in Annandal and Wyatt's place. We miss it already. Hope to be back soon!"
2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,5581269,Percy,Michy is a wonderful host with a great little backyard shack in a beautiful location. Highly recommended.

What a comfort that everything has been taken care of. The cleanliness and comfort to an apartment ready for your arrival. 

Spent the last 3 nights and I could simply call it my second home. 

Wendy has been very accommodating and is happy to help with any questions you may have in relation to the apartment to the area! 

Certainly one apartment not to overlook with a indoor swimming pool, spa and sauna!

Will book here again when I come back to Sydney!"
2018-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,7439246,Shana,This apartment was in a fantastic location. You really could not get any closer to the beautiful beach. The bus system was also very easy with a convenient stop right outside of the apartment. Maroubra is such a cute little beach subarb that I’d love to visit again.

Having 3 kids of his own, Mal was extra helpful with the loan of a cot, high chair, stroller & dvd's which made travelling with our own little one that much easier. 

I'll be booking with Mal again when next in Sydney."

2018-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,6785160,Abhilash,"The place was really well maintained. All necessary amenities were provided by Carole and Steve. The room and extra lounge was really helpful. The place that you have for yourself is private and you have plenty of space for yourself with the lounge room. Carole and Steve were always around for any requirement we had. Sweet place :)

Additionally note, The cute doggo 'buddy' was is super friendly and had his own boundary but was always happy to play with you :)

Definitely pick this place if an opportunity presented itself."

2012-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Rindra,"I loved staying at David's house as it was the perfect place for my trip when I went to Sydney for a conference.

1- The location is very convenient (close to business district but in a quiet and nice area). There were also many food places around. I found a good grocery store and a fine pizza restaurant near the house, which was one David's recommendations. 

2- David was very helpful and welcoming. He was kind enough to let me check in early and check out late on Sundays. 

3- The house is very clean and modern. The bedroom is comfortable and it has a nice terrace. What I loved the most about my experience is that although I had tons of work to do during my stay, David's place allowed me to do so with tranquility and convenience.

I highly recommend this place to people who needs tranquility, comfort and convenience. I will definitely recommend it to my friends, and will check it out again when I will return to Australia.

We arrived in the morning, and they had already left for work by the time we got to their place, but the concierge knew we were coming and everything worked out very smoothly. The room has a gorgeous view, and we woke up to a beautiful sunrise each morning. Naveen and Tristan were very friendly and gave us lots of good information about the area. Our room was well-stocked with all supplies we needed during the stay, which was very useful. It was my first Airbnb experience and it was definitely a good one! Oh, and their dog, Felix, is an awesome little buddy who loves to just sit next to you and snuggle."
2017-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Phil,"We knew there were many beautiful places to visit in the area but the apartment and it's aspect were so stunning we spent almost all our time there enjoying the view and the pool. 

It was only a short walk to an intimate little Greek restaurant, a bottle store and a grocers shop  - and to the most aptly named Paradise Beach. Couldn't have wished for better. Superb. 

Our expectations were high. They were exceeded. 
We're already planning a return trip.

I recommend it."
2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,19376053,Berry,Location is great. Very close to central but if you're a light sleeper than avoid it because of the main road next to the apartment. Lots of noise at night

2018-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,1944996,Colin,Lovely place in a perfect location. Great interior! Might get a little noisy if you let the window open at night and a little warm if you don’t use the fans. Other than that we had a great stay!

2016-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Yasmina,"This is a fantastic central location, with loads of shops/  restaurants/ bars/ pubs within a 5 minute radius. The room I stayed in was ample for one person and the shared bathroom is amazing - both are large and kept very clean. Arnie and Lorraine are both lovely and I really enjoyed my stay.

2014-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Donna,"Incredibly convenient! Lovely house. Clean and inviting. Everything in good working order.

Enjoyed a lovely weekend with my guests from out of town (8 in total) and had a great time. Jeremy has been a pleasure to deal with- prompt responses and made an effort to be helpful and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again.
Parking can be a bit tricky but is possible. This is obviously the pay-off for staying in such a central location."
2018-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,21971876,Jaimi-Lea,"A very private part of the house. It was very quiet, good for study. There was table space and a fridge which I obviously didn't read about because I was so excited to see that."
2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,26829659,Laura,"Joseph and Judy’s place is just what we needed for our stay at Olympic Park. It is so clean and comfortable and everything we needed was there .

2018-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Jenna,"WOW. This was by far the most outstanding AirBnB experience I have had to date. Susan's place itself is perfectly located a short walk from Bronte beach and is a gorgeous garden hideaway under the shade of a mulberry tree, that we loved coming ""home"" to each day. The space is tastefully designed and decorated and the thoughtful touches went above and beyond ... from delicious gluten-free muesli, to the high quality tea selection, and natural and high quality soaps, high-speed WiFi. Our hosts were easy-going, kind and friendly, we felt immediately at home and were only sorry we didn't have more time to spend with them. Thank you!"

2018-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,21612973,Kay,Can not recommend this airbnb highly enough! The hosts are stellar. The accomodation is great and the location is an easy walk from the ferry and beach. Highly recommend

2015-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Steve,"My experience at Rhonda's place was amazing.  Rhonda is super nice, friendly, kind and easy going.  She will do anything for you and can provide heaps of insider knowledge on Sydney and surrounds.  The granny flat style accommodation is perfect, chocolates on arrival, little sops and shampoo to use, super comfy bed, nice sheets, everything you could ask for.  Miranda is a lovely suburb that is very safe and family friendly, nice big trees with lots of birds, close to transport and shops and not far from the beach either if you have a car.  I could not recommend highly enough for anyone visiting Sydney to stay at Rhonda's house, you won't regret it!"

2018-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,16609607,Alessandro,"The value for this place was outstanding. 
There was no couch & no TV. However, the location, the apartment, amenities in the apartment & Linda ( lovely hostess ) were outstanding. 
The place was very clean, bed was very comfortable. 

Lots of windows that could be opened. The place has air conditioner, however I prefer fresh air & there was plenty of it. It was hot in Sydney but I never once had the aircon on. 

Views were lovely. Woolworth just down the road, very close & lots of great places to eat. The area & apartments around look amazing I wish ADELAIDE would take note!!

No more than 10 mins from Central Station. Apart from no couch & tv which didn't bother me that much as this place had so much to offer. The value was exceptional ! 

Definitely would stay again when visiting & definitely would recommend 

THANK YOU Linda :))"
2015-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,781631,Laura,"Mike was very nice and helpful to us. We stayed at Mike's place for 10 days and really felt at home. The appartment is spacious, conveniently located and the view from the rooftop is certainly one of the best you can get in Sydney. Potts Point is furthermore a very nice area with a wide choice of restaurants and bars. We would love to come back!"
2017-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Karen,"Artistic, inspirational space ideal for big group who drives (especially if tourists); who are punctual (cleaners do show up on the dot on the hour of your checkout); well prepared (remember to BYO amenities like hair dryers, body wash, tea/coffee); responsible (read the manual and follow all to-dos). Since we were such a group we had a lovely stay! Don't miss amazing view of harbour bridge from the end of Blue Points Road!"
2017-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Emma,"A very comfortable home in an amazing location. The perfect place for anyone that needs to switch off for a few days.

Communication with Richard was great. He did everything he could to make our stay enjoyable including having the construction workers next door turn their radio down. 

The kiddies loved the easy access to the beach and also spent lots of time playing the many games that are available.

We didn’t want for anything."

2015-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Kristyn,We really enjoyed our stay at backyard cabin by Pittwater.  Michy was the most hospitable host who was eager to help us in any way.

My partner and I stayed at Pittwater Paradise over our wedding weekend and Evelyn went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. All previous comments about the amazing views, great location and excellent host are fully justified. On our wedding night we were very touched to come home to a chilled bottle of bubbly.

2015-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Barbara,"Mags was friendly and communicative in her Emails but we had no personal contact. In fact ,we had become used to some personal touches from our airbnb hosts and this was somehow lacking.After a few days we grew more used to the apartment and could appreciate the  functional new kitchen and bathroom. Even though the photos do show the apartment correctly, the actual feel of the place was very different to what we had imagined.In our opinion a few improvements would make a lot of difference.Stepping in and out of the bath for the shower could be a problem for someone with limited mobility.
Mosman is a fantastic area to be in, beautiful tree lined streets with wonderful houses, shops and restaurants and the apartment is situated well for transport once you work out the bus and ferry connections. "

Location was perfect, right in the centre of the high street, clean, tidy and the beds were very comfy. Couldn’t have been happier with the value for money and Paul was very quick at responding and keeping us updated. Would definitely stay again!"
2018-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,21988560,佳蕙Brianna,"The location is very easy to access since Arncliff station is just next to the apartment and Wolli Creek station within 15 min walk!! A Uber only cost about $18 to the airport (Same as the train but much better). 
       The apartment is very clean and lovely decorated. I loved the clean bathroom and the spacious living room. Tim & Liz kindly used very clear and specific sticky note to help familiarize everything. (Website hidden by Airbnb) I did enjoy the short stay and recommend it to the other travelers . :))"
2017-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Henry,"Great and comfortable stay. Close to everything. Good restaurants and coffee shops within a block. 20 minute walk to Opera House, etc. Vickie was the perfect host.  "
2016-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Fredrik,"Me and my friend had a week in Sydney over New Years. It was very hard to find a place to stay, but DJ was quick and easy to communicate with! We enjoyed the location of the house because it's walking distance to the inner city and has easy access to beaches by buss. David is very kind and helpful, and he has made a great guide for what you can do in Sydney and some popular bars/restaurants. Our experience of the city and the house was good, although it rained a lot... We don't know what we would have done without the huge umbrellas you provided haha. Would definitely stay at your place again if I'm ever in Sydney again. 

Thank you for your hospitality."
2016-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,9577071,Joel,"Jason's place was exceptional! Our hosts were able to meet us at check-in, and getting to know them briefly was fantastic. Their home is welcoming, as is Bondi Beach. The flat is walking distance from groceries, restaurants, and of course, the bus. We were comfortable with the assurance that when coming home after long days in the city, we would have anything we needed and a quiet place to rest up for the next big day out. Bondi is a wonderful community - staying here, I think we saw the best side of Sydney."
2017-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,21648821,Diego,"It is a beautiful place to stay, very clean, comfortable and in a great location."
2019-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,13320545,Priy D,"Quirky place in nice location. Noisy - particularly if you're not from a big city. Standoffish host. 

Incident where I was shouted at and accused of trying to watch her do her feet. W hen actually as I was walking to the bathroom, the host was holding her foot up - very much like patients, in my profession - do to show me their injury/ailment/complaint. Therefore, I paused momentarily - about to ask if everything was alright. Got shouted at - totally uncalled for."
2017-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Pindz,Awesome place!! very clean and tidy. Mohit is an awesome host!!

There’s great eating places and supermarkets nearby, around 5-10 mins walk. Even a shopping mall 15-20 mins walk. The apartment is very clean, comfortable  and comes with all the amenities needed for our stay. The wifi is strong and was great for us. Andrew is a great host and we had no problems at all checking in and out . He gives very clear information. He’s even left some tips on some great places to eat and buy stuffs. Thanks so much Andrew !"

Lots of choices for dining and a local market is only a short walk away.
Bottle shop( liquor store) is close as well.

Craige and Lee are awesome!
Invited me to join them for a barbecue.

Thanks again Cat:)"
2018-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,16898275,Jane,"Clean and charmingly decorated. Neighbourhood was quiet, pretty and close to bay. Easy to walk to wharf and catch a ferry over to Circular Quay.

Did not meet Trent but communication was quick and easy. 

Parking available on street for free but can be busy so be prepared that you might have to park further away. We were only there for a night so didn’t have much luggage, but might need to factor that in if you do have a lot of luggage. Posting does mention a private parking space, not sure if there is a separate space other than street or if this just refers to the street but we utilised street.


Towels provided. No toiletries so best to pack some.

Tip: we found it difficult to unlock the main door by mailbox but there is another door around the other side that was much easier to open with the key.

Wifi only worked for about an hour and then we had no wifi at all. Other than that, it’s a great unit in a nice neighbourhood and would recommend."
2017-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Tony,"We had a very comfortable stay at Patrick and Christine’s place. The location is great, close to bus and tram public transport, along with a good selection of GoGet vehicles. There are some great shops, pubs and places to eat nearby, with every cuisine catered for.

The house itself is well appointed, modern and clean with everything you expect and need for a comfortable stay. Patrick and Christine responded quickly to all communication and the 12pm checkout was fantastic. 10am is such a hideously early checkout time. I’d definitely stay here again."
2018-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Jennifer,Enjoyed our stay. Thanks Paul
2018-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,20374683,Stacey,"The location is excellent, the place is clean, modern and had everything you could need. Phan was an absolute pleasure to deal with. 100% recommend!"
2018-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Hongting,"Alexey is really nice and kind. He replied quickly and let us early check-in without any fee. The apartment is very clean and all things needed are well prepared. It got a super good location, just two-minute walk to Central Station with a beautiful view of the city through the window. Self check-in is really easy. Highly recommend!!"
2016-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Kim,"Cathy is a lovely host that is providing a nice and cosy room in a quiet and relaxing area of Avalon Beach above Sydney.  A really comfortable stay, a short trip away to some amazing beaches!  Cathy provided plenty of useful local tips during our stay including helping us figure out our plans on NYE in Sydney relating to public transport.  "
2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Matt,"Cat's place suited our needs perfectly. It was clean, comfortable, had plenty of amenities and was close to bars, cafes and the beach.

2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Kiew Hong,"Clean, good location and you won't regret on booking a stay at this place."
2015-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,9810515,Andreas,Stor och trivsam lägenhet. Dock störande oljud från ventilationen i fastigheten nattetid. Trevligt område med flera restauranger och pubar i närheten. Enkelt att ta sig de centrala delarna av Sydney till fots.
2018-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Les,Susan would be an excellent host for a couple looking for a personal and caring bed and breakfast experience.  We were disappointed in the size of the facility (plenty of room outdoors in the garden - but that was spoilt by mosquitoes).  The breakfast offerings were high quality and unusual but limited in choice and very much a DIY experience.
2015-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,5461928,Colleen,"The house was clean, beautiful and had a lot of character. Steph is warm and professional, and we had no issues with any of the amenities or access during our short stay. Highly recommend this place!"

2018-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Kate,"This is a perfect Avalon escape, walking distance to the beach and immaculately presented. Angela has considered every detail, from fresh bread, kids toys because we needed them, and Champagne. There’s a perfect green lawn for kids or sunbathing, and shaded outdoor dining. 
The kitchen is well appointed, the fridge full size, the aircon works well. 
Loved our stay!! We’ll be back!"

2014-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Chi,"We stayed in a separate part of the house which had a bedroom, bathroom, and living room.  It was clean and tidy, very cosy, and comfortable.  There were magnificent views of the sea upstairs in the kitchen.  The hosts (Fred and Bernadette) were friendly and made us feel welcome.  We will definitely be coming back if we are in the area again!"

2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Tirta,"The place is central to many landmarks. Town Hall station is just 5 minutes walk away. The place itself is very clean and well-maintained. If you have nothing to do at night because Sydney shops close after 5pm, there is Grace Hotel nearby which includes an Irish pub. There is also a post office just a couple of doors from the Airbnb if you ever need to ship things home. Danny was also very responsive in all our communications which was really comforting."
2016-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,Nicholas,"Mal's apartment is incredible, such a wonderful spot. Mal was a great host, really accommodating and generous with his time. 

Highly recommended. "
2017-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Malik,Anita is great host. The building is under refurbishment so there is a lot of noise and ugly scaffolding infront of window so you won't get sea views.
2017-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Nicola,"We were very well at David's house. The apartment in old style is furnished very well and located a very lively neighborhood, close to all the comforts. "
2014-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Shayla,"The listing description was accurate. The house was clean and had lovely accommodations. We loved the location. The neighborhood was off a busy street where we could easily catch a cab or take a bus. Also had cute boutiques, restaurants and pubs on the side streets. The location definitely made us want to come back and be able to explore Paddington more. "

2016-11-06T04:00:00.000Z,8277472,Dave,"This safe and beautiful tree-lined suburb, with easy access by foot or very regular public transport to the Airport, Sydney city and surrounds, made a stay in Glebe perfect.  Every type of restaurant, cafe, store etc are just around the corner. The room and spacious bathroom were immaculately clean, and our hosts Elizabeth and Simon made us feel incredibly welcome - almost part of the family.  We look forward to returning again, and recommend Elizabeth and Simon's beautiful home to anyone looking for a relaxing stay in Sydney, with the chance to meet two fantastic new friends. "

2018-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,26340840,David,This is an amazing gem at Drummoyne. The house is spectacular and has all the essentials for a big group of people. Franca and Alessio are very accommodating and great people. They were able to accomodate us on Boxing Day as we had two last minute cancellations. I can’t recommend them enough. I will definitely be back.
2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,27580166,Christopher,"Would highly recommend this place, couldnt ask for more from an airbnb, great location and room. The hosts were so helpful and friendly."
2013-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,1143151,Matthew,"Why would you stay in a hotel when you could stay in this compact but all-you-need apartment in a perfect location just on the north side of the bridge in Sydney?  There are great eateries near by (our favourite - takeaway gourmet burgers overlooking the Opera House and harbour), and train and ferry only a few minutes away. Eleanor was very flexible and everything went very smoothly, and her provision of breakfast food and staples was very helpful.
Recommended."
2017-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,6201263,Ashley,This is the place I have been 3 times.
2016-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Vanessa,"The room was very clean and tidy, the only problem I had was that the shower gets cold after 5 minutes, as I've got long hair it's almost impossible to take such a quick shower, and I wasn't waiting for that, because I didn't know.

"
2018-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Donna,"Cathy thought of everything.  It is a beautiful, clean room in a lovely setting.  Cathy was there if we needed anything and still respected our privacy.  
The room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean.  Excellent value for money. 
I would highly recommend."
2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,6046461,Mahmood,Suzie is such a friendly and attentive host. Makes you feel welcome in her immaculate place. Was a great stay - super handy to the conference center!

2017-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Mun,"Kath's place is clean and very near to the Redfern station. Community is quite safe at night as the building is along the main road from the train station. Near to supermarket as well. Check in time is not exactly flexible as the host is only available early in the morning or in the evening. However, Kath did adjust check in time to 2:30pm to accommodate us. We greatly appreciate that. Generally we did have a very pleasant stay at Kath's place. Her dog is very cute too."
2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,26334724,Carl,"The apartment is in a great location - under 10 mins walk from Redfern station. 

Central air conditioning is a big plus especially in winter.

The IGA over the road is very handy.

Good hosts who communicated well with us throughout our stay.

Check in and check out is simple and easy.

The house is in a convenient location with Woolworths nearby which made simple food preparation a breeze after a long day. "
2017-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Megan,"We had a wonderful stay at Paul's place. It's within easy walking distance of The Corso, the beach and the ferry. The house is lovely and open with lots of natural light. The beds are comfortable, we got a great nights sleep! The kitchen is old but has everything you need. Our nearly 2 year old is pretty busy and was interested in everything at her eye level, we brought some of our own toys and the tv was great for distraction! There are some great playgrounds nearby and the beach is great for the little ones. 
Paul is very easy to communicate with and replies quickly with any questions. Would recommend to couples or small families with slightly older children than ours."
2017-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Amy,"Great location if needing an early flight from Sydney airport or arriving from a late flight.
In residential area, huge Woolworths and Dan Murphy's liquor store only few hundred metres. Bed reasonably comfortable, office desk and plenty of charge points for devices.
Excellent instructions provided, able to gain keys and entry without any assistance which was fantastic.
3km to nearby bay St and plenty of restaurants 
Bathroom well equipped, excellent shower pressure and heat, washing machine also available.
You do share shower & kitchen/small living area with another guest if both rooms booked.
Could have used a vacuum prior to stay, hairs on floors.
Otherwise felt clean, smell and feel though almost like little too much product!
Kitchenette, small hot plate, fridge, jug and toaster."
2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Lee,"Such a great location and the photos don't do the fabulous view justice. Positive prompt hosting and a good folio of info and tips on site. This is an excellent value, convenient apartment for a Sydney stay."
2016-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Phi,Shuang was very helpful and was very quick with his responses to any questions i had. Was clean and had all the things i needed to have a comfortable stay.
2018-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,6361929,Veronika,"I would really recommend this place as it is close to the public transport and it's affordable. Very clean and comfortable room. Edi is really friendly and kind, she gave us many tips where to go in Sydney and was ready to help anytime. The planes weren't an issue, we could sleep without any disturbing."

Set in a beautiful backyard she has thought of everything, including breakfast, which is often overlooked with BnB. This was one of our best experiences staying at an Airbnb and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a 5 star experience of Sydney."
2019-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,26340840,Nathan,"Very nice house built in the 1920's located in the Drummoyne neighborhood.  This is a close-in suburb to Sydney - only a few miles, but about 30-45 minutes by car, depending on traffic.  There is on-site parking for 2+ cars, which is really nice, although street parking was easy to find in the neighborhood as well.  Close to cycling/walking paths that run all over the area.  The house is in great shape and has a very nice outdoor living area that we enjoyed.  There were a lot of board games in a closet, which was a plus for our kids.  I'd definitely stay here again."
2017-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,16261574,Alison,The apartment was modern and in a very convenient location. The view was fantastic!

2017-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Sharleen,"Victoria's apartment was a short walk to King's Cross station, and well located to travel to the main attractions. The apartment is located in an upscale local neighbourhood with plenty of eateries in the area and a supermarket and deli right opposite. The apartment itself was spotless and very clean. It had everything we needed - toiletries, towels, a small kitchen and coffee. Victoria was lovely and we had a wonderful stay here."
2016-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Chris,"I have to say i am a little baffled at how positive the reviews are for the place we arrived at, and I completely agree with Binna's review below mine. I didn't see any 'drug addicts' around the apartment areas and the area has all the shops and takeaways you could need. We also felt safe in the area, and didn't run into any problems. However, On arrival, We were met by the cleaner who showed us to our apartment. The apartment itself is in a dilapidated building with marks, chips and wallpaper coming off which obviously isn't advertised. It seriously needs renovating as it's in a bad state. 

For £550 over a week, and the fact that the cleaner had asked us to come back in 30 minutes when she had finished cleaning (after check in time), the floor was still covered in dust which we found attached to the suitcases as we had to put them in the lounge area due to no room for them in the bedroom, and the couch is also pretty stained (also not in the pictures). I advise you to not look under the couch... as it needs a clean before anyone does... and finally the bathroom is covered in Mould (also not in the pictures). Bath also needs a good clean, as neither myself or my parter were interested in one. Could also do with sorting out the rusty drains in the bathroom too.

You will also need to bring earplugs as an essential item, it took us 3 nights to get an 'ok' sleep due to the noise, over the weekdays too as the walls are paper thin. We live on a busy main road at home, but I can't emphasis enough that the road outside the apartment is seriously loud, don't underestimate it as it does sound like you are outside. I had to buy -85 decibel silicon earplugs for my partner just so she could sleep.

The guide to the area was good and the amenities were too, except for the towels, as we were given 2 towels between the 2 of us for a week's stay. The shower was powerful enough and didn't run out of hot water which was great. 

I also contacted Paul and asked about the internet issue on arrival, as the wifi is particularly slow. I understand Australia doesn't have the greatest network, but 2mbps isn't usable, so bring a 4G data package with you for your mobile. 

I understand that I could of emailed Paul and complained about the bathroom, towels, noise, internet, cleanliness, etc.. But I have never had to do this before or do I really feel I should need to. Previous places I have stayed have been great with air bnb, but there is a difference when unsatisfied and paying £550 for a week for the above. Believe me, I am usually pretty chilled out with accommodations, but this one really needs a thorough clean and some sound proofing."

2017-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,2838442,Emmanuel,"A charming peaceful place with a lovely owner!
The comfortable granny flat is independent, in a nice garden, feeling like in the forest, a beautiful natural environment.
Rhonda is amazingly welcoming, easy going, knowledgeable and full of kindness.
I felt like in a pleasant family.
5 stars are not enough!"

2017-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,15889399,Jessica,"This was the perfect place to stay for us. It was close to public transport for business purposes and close to shops, restaurants, and parks for our little one.
Steven and his family were extremely welcoming and helpful.
The cabin was beautiful. Clean and light. The air con was a bonus as it was quite warm in Sydney at the time of our stay. They provided a porta cot for our baby which was an added bonus.
It was very quiet and peaceful. 
Steven and his family kept to themselves, but were lovely to talk to on the odd occasion we bumped into them on the way out the door.
We would highly recommend this place to stay. Thanks for having us guys "
2019-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Danitza,"So good place to stay, near to airport for take an uber not very expensive. Good details in amenities and everything that you could need (as umbrella for rainy day in sydney, for example). Everything nice and clean."
2018-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,21999107,Jeff,Neil’s place was absolutely beautiful and Neil was a great host. I had some questions early on that he addressed quickly and made our international trip much easier. We will stay here again if we are back in the Sydney area!

2017-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Farhana,"Angela's house was a lovely place to stay during my short trip to Sydney. Her house is spotless and neat, with everything you could possibly need to feel at home. In particular, the tissue box and folder of nearby restaurant pamphlets on the desk were thoughtful touches! 
The bed itself was comfy to sleep in and the room receives plenty of natural light. 
Breakfast and towels were all provided, and Angela and Coby are kind and considerate of their guests.  
Just a tip to keep in mind how big your luggage will be as there is no lift and you'll have to climb a few flights of stairs to reach her house. 
Overall a great experience that exceeded my expectations!"
2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,19641701,Fonnie,Its a great unit with a beautiful view where you can stay comfortably while exploring all over Sydney.  The unit is beautiful and has everything you need and more!
2017-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,16160263,Morgan,"As many have said before us, the photos really do not do this place justice. The accommodation is a very generous space, full of natural light, a beautiful setting high in the trees with a peaceful outlook.

Great deck / balcony for lunch or a drink in the afternoon. Some very nice homely touches with tea, coffee, a few basics and some absolutely cracking c coconut biscuits :)

Would definitely visit again."

2014-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Christine,"Susan is the perfect host..warm and friendly but unobtrusive. The cabin is private and comfortable, good shower and has easy access to all Sydney has to offer. Public transport is efficient and accessible. The aircraft noise varies so it's easy to ignore it. 
Leichhardt is an interesting area with plenty of restaurants and services. I would  certainly stay here again.

The annex is spacious, light, modern and well presented. It only took 10 min to get to the train station and a further 20 min to get into the centre of the city. George and lucias granny flat felt private, secure and like a little retreat! We highly recommend staying here with or without children. "

2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Fizzy,"Cathy's place was perfect for our stay in Avalon, just a short distance from all the restaurants and beaches we wanted to visit. The place was very clean and checking in/communicating with Cathy was made very easy. She even provided breakfast bits in the fridge for us which was a lovely touch. Highly recommend for a weekend stay!"
2017-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Paul,"Excellent location - perfect to enjoy a bit of ""local"" flavor but also only a short walk to the train station to explore more of Sydney. Also has a supermarket exactly opposite so extremely convenient. Vickie kept in touch with us and arranged to have the internet fixed very quickly when it failed even though she was not in Sydney at the time."
2016-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Matthew,Simon and Nicole's apartment has everything you need and in a great location. Just a few minutes walk to Crown Street with loads of dining options and only 5 minutes or so walk to  Central Station. The Surry Hills is the best location to stay in Sydney.

Thank you, Joyti, Uttam and grandma, looking forward to visit you again!

2016-09-20T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Jodey-Alice,"Angela and Geoff were very fast to respond to messages and check in was smooth. The space itself is very well appointed and spacious. We stayed here for our wedding accommodation and there were so many small details that made our stay really special. From the delicious bottle of french champagne, farmers market strawberries, bowl of fruit and yogurt, to the beautiful smelling fresh garden roses placed through out the property.
If you like a good bath then you will love this one, the outlook is onto a little tropical garden area and it was raining when I had mine and the sound of the raindrops on the leaves outside the window was so relaxing.
Overall our experience was perfect - this would have to be our favourite airbnb stay to date.
Thanks for making it so special Angela and Geoff!

2018-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Katherine,"We really enjoyed our stay at Paul’s apartment! The space is very clean with a comfortable bed - exactly what we needed after long days of sightseeing in Sydney. It was very easy to access public transportation from Paul’s place, but if you’re up for a walk, it’s not far from downtown. Potts Point is a fun neighborhood and we’re glad we stayed here. We highly recommend Paul’s place if you’re traveling through Sydney!"
2016-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Bianca,"My daughter and I loved staying at this gorgeous little apartment.  Although the space is small, the furniture and lay out work really well and the place was very tidy.  We felt comfortable in the space, especially because our host went out of her way to make sure we felt welcome. The location is fabulous - close to the train or ferry and within walking distance of the harbour bridge, Luna park, Kirabilli and Wendy's secret garden.  The view from the balcony is gorgeous and we were lucky enough to see fireworks on Saturday night and have some native birds come and visit us in the morning.  Thank you Millie! This is why I love airbnb! "

2016-05-04T04:00:00.000Z,12117514,Kitty,"Gwen is very sweet! met with her briefly and she gave me good tips. The flat was cozy and clean, 5 mins walk to the beach and amazing restaurants: I loved BrownSugar right in front of their place. Staying here depends on what you are doing in Bondi. If it's to party and enjoy the nearby festivities until the wee hours of the night then this is perfect for you. I have to say that this place was a little too loud for my taste. Loud music from neighbors late at night and the busy street wasn't all that fun for an early sleeper like myself dealing with jet lag but it's out of Gwen's control so I just put my earplugs in and hoped for the best. Other than that, their place is perfectly located in safe area, and very close to the beach. Like I said it all depends on what you want out of your stay! "

The check in was smooth and Steve was very helpful and friendly! We were also allowed to leave our bags in the house while we explore Sydney on our last day and pick it up just before our evening flight. Location is great!! Located near Newtown which is a very nice and cool place to explore. It is also located very near to a bus and train that leads you straight to anywhere you would like to explore in Sydney. The house is also such a treat to return to after a long busy day out. You will have a nice big bed to sleep in and a big bathroom all to yourself. Additionally, there is also a lounge that we were allowed to use all to ourself to make coffee or tea. Overall, very thankful to Steve and Carole and will definetely be back here if ever in Sydney :)"
2018-06-16T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Narelle,"Fred and Bernadette's home is beautifully located right on the Bay.  We enjoyed warm weather which made morning walks a delight. Unfortunately, we did not meed Bernadette, though Fred greeted us warmly and we very much appreciated the vase of flowers, chocolate and fresh juice.

The home itself was immaculate and I appreciated the quality linen and towels.

We were offered a later check out if we would like it, which was very much appreciated.

My Mum, sister and myself had a wonderful time in Sydney enjoying Vivid, the theatre and an NRL game,  It was an extra bonus to get a bus directly to Circular Quay on the doorstep.

I would definitely stay here again, thanks Fred and Bernadette for a terrific break."

Palatial and nuzzled into a hill, it is essentially a vertical house with many bedrooms and lots of different common areas to relax, including three decks. The home is extremely comfortable and I highly recommend it. Plus, Bailey was incredibly nice and communicative while planning our stay. Overall a 10 out of 10!"

Linda is very responsive and easy to contact even though we never get to meet her. The only slight problem is that we need to climb a flight of stairs to get to the apartment so will need to carry the luggage. But other than that l, it was a nice stay. "

I've Airbnb-ed a lot in the past months here in Sydney and I must say this place was my absolute favourite of all :) It's a cosy piece of paradise with the most beautiful view, directly above the ocean, super huge bedroom that feels like its own little apartment, incredibly cute decorations, a super comfy huge bed, extremely lovely hosts and a neighbourhood and area that is truly feeling like a millionaires paradise :) Sitting in the pillows at the huge window, or hearing the ocean in bed and having a coffee, ocean breeze or swim right below the apartment felt like the ultimate vacation, I can't recommend it enough!! :) Thank you to both of you for sharing your little paradise :)"
2018-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,18616850,Cleve,Outstanding residence. Perfect location. Stylish. Spotless. Bradley is communicative and easy going. Definitely consider staying again when I'm back in Sydney.

2015-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Elizabeth,"Marcella's welcome was very enthusiastic and warm. Her home is in a very quiet, safe area and very well positioned to the beach, corner shops, cafes and restaurants. "
2018-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Kf,Sam is such a great host who went above and beyond to help make sure my needs are accommodated. That does not mean travelers can be demanding of her. Be nice to this charming lady! Lol! The place is also very convenient with a nearby mall and bus station. Suitable for single or couples traveler.

2014-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,781631,Lana,Mike is a friendly and great guy. The apartment is clean and in a great location. Lots of nice cafes and restaurants near by. Room isn't great with sound proof against the street noise and the place does not look as new as the pictures but overall good value.

2018-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,12098138,Mandy,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Tamarama from the spectacular view to the furnishings of the apartment which made our stay so special. We were greeted by yummy bread, fruit and other essentials which was greatly appreciated. The location was ideal for exploring Sydney with many great walks and beaches close by. Lizzie was a delightful host and we are already thinking about our next visit ."
2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Amanda Dee,"Mariana's apartment is wonderful. Not only for it's location, really close to many of the most important amenities of Sydney but also for the great job that Mariana did with it. It has absolutely everything that you can imagine or you may need. The design is wonderful and beautiful and all the appliances are brand new and the best quality.
We would definitely go back and stay there again and again."
2014-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Casey,"What a perfect introduction to air bnb. Susan is the most welcoming host and from the moment we arrived we felt at home. The immaculate studio is set in a beautiful garden in your own private oasis. Susan could not do enough for us and her attention to detail made our experience flawless.  The fresh flowers on the bedside, the organic range of breakfast treats & crisp comfortable linen made it hard to leave. The location is an easy walk to the local cafés, transport & beach. Everything is at your finger tips. We cannot thank Susan enough for making our stay the perfect few days away, we look forward to coming back. "
2015-07-12T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Olivia,"Linda left us the keys in the letter box for us to checked ourselves in.  It is a lovely place and it's same as the pictures posted. Quiet area, only few minutes walk from the train station! There's also a garage for our rented car, which makes it so convenient for us. Linda's place have basically everything, from laundry liquid to heater. The lovely note and OZ's all time favorite TimTam was a great bonus! Clean and nice place to live in!  "
2013-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,794910,Gabriel,"It goes without saying, Gavin was a great host and guide. We stayed with him for two weeks, and couldn't have asked for a better place. His home is lovely, clean and there was always plenty of fresh fruits for breakfast. The bed was really comfortable and the room was quite  convenient. Upon our arrival, after 30+ hours of flights and airport, a great home cooked meal and a bottle of wine was waiting for us. With all his great tips about Sydney and the area (he would sometimes plan a great day trip for us), he really made us feel at home and welcomed! Si vous passez par Sydney, vous devez absolument passez chez Gavin. Son accueil et la connaissance de sa ville native, font de lui un hôte extraordinaire! 
Gavin, best wishes, if your ever pass by Montreal, you are more than welcome to come see us!
Gabriel & Ngoc-An"

2017-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Kaoru,Shuang's place was super clean and convenience to go to airport.
2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,24863216,Ilya,good place
2017-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Amrinder,Nice place would go there again
2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,21612973,Graeme,"Nice place, beautifully renovated. Handy to down town Manly and the ferry. My room even had a desk which was perfect for catching up with some work."
2018-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Peter,A really lovely room hosted by a great couple. Good location just a couple of bus stops away from darling harbour. The apartment is really cosy with some lovely cosy touches.
2017-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,10091713,Sarah,"Ben’s place is in a lively, busy Sydney neighbourhood. There’s always lots going on and plenty of great places to eat, drink and socialise. We recommend Messina for amazing ice cream and Bourke St Bakery - both within walking distance.
The apartment itself is cosy, compact and ideal for solo travellers or couples who don’t need too much space. It’s bright, stylishly decorated and has all the amenities you’ll need for a few days in the city."
2017-05-09T04:00:00.000Z,15960997,Callum,Nice apartment to stay for a few nights. own bathroom and plenty of room with amazing views. Terry was great. Very easy to be picked up from the airport and dropped back. Would stay again.
2018-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,21281467,Elizabeth,The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2018-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Emma,"We had a fantastic time at Angela’s. Travelling with our 22-month old toddler, we appreciated the extra amenities - toys, travel cot, high chair and a stocked pantry. Angela even bought bread, milk and yogurt for us before we arrived. How thoughtful! 

The apartment itself was very clean, tastefully furnished and well cared for. Both the outdoor and indoor space was toddler-friendly. Our son could easily occupy himself minutes on end in the garden! We also enjoyed putting some beautiful, fresh produce on the barbie. Dinner sorted! (The apartment has a small open kitchen. The stove is too small for any serious cooking so bbq is the easier option.)

In terms of location, the house is walking distance from the beach. The road is not flat though and there are a few steps of stairs to access the beach. One can walk to the town centre via the beach but we always drove as we would often come back with shopping.

All in all, we’d highly recommend Angela’s apartment to any couple or small family travelling to Sydney in the summer."
2018-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,23493822,병준,"Great master bedroom with in built bathroom.
I’d recommend to anyone visiting Epping for a stay."

2017-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,16549021,Jonathan,This is a great place with plenty of space. If you had a family then this would be awesome
2018-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,15920870,Rohit,"Oliver’s apartment is conveniently located and has good quality equipment. He is also very responsive. However it appears that he has not paid attention to the cleanliness aspect and we found the place to be quite unclean with used unwashed bed sheets and covers and smelly towels. The supplies were also running low and we had to replenish them (though he did reimburse us). The trash can had something sticky and gooey in it so we just used trash bags without the dustbin. The tea supplies were past expiry date. All in all an unpleasant experience - wouldn’t go there again. Oliver says his cleaners let him down! Anyway, he refunded the cleaning fees, but frankly I expected a clean place to begin with with a so called “5 Star” host. Spoiled our trip. Never again!"
2016-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,15332652,Matthew,"Lilian and her Mum were very accommodating allowing me to check-in early. Her place was clean, tidy and close to transport - very convenient!"
2017-10-17T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Stephan,Paul and Judith were very welcoming. Always happy to help. They even lend us their opal cards for public transportation. A really nice place to stay  when you go visit Sydney for a couple of days.
2019-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Lily,Great location!!! Was close to everything we needed but still felt quiet and private. The upstairs deck was the cherry on top!
2018-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,20865085,Jenny,Great place and Jenny is a lovely host. We had a great time in Sydney!
2018-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Paul,"This was by far one of my favourite AirBnbs. It is central, lively and has everything you could need all in a cosy and open little apartment. Thanks so much for letting me stay. I will definitely be looking for this place next time I'm in Sydney."
2018-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,David,"Awesome apartment with everything needed.  The apartment is nicely decorated, very comfortable bed, well equipped kitchen and a nice shower.  Great neighborhood and great location for exploring Sydney.

Mariana, the host, was very responsive and helpful during my stay.   I highly recommend Mariana's apartment."
2017-11-07T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,창옥,Super host very good! Her house wonderful and location.
2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,5549057,Reza,"I stayed at Brendan's place and had a wonderful stay. Brendan is very helpful, responsive and even took me to the tour around the neighborhood to familiar myself with the location. The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood but it is  just behind the main road leading to the beach, offering variety of cafes, bars and restaurants.  All you need to do is simply take a leisure walk. In terms of public transportation, there is a nearby bus stop at the main road that can connect you to the Bondi Train Station, and from here you can take train ride to the city. All in all, it is a convenient place for me!"
2018-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Rishabh,"You will never get a reply on time from the host.!!
He is very laid back in replying to messages and unresponsive to any problems you face.
He will always find a way to avoid answering you to your problems by replying irrelevant answers.!!"
2018-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,21127680,Dao,Good location.
2016-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Kathleen,"An apartment with stunning views within easy reach of Darling Harbour, Circular key and the main shopping areas. Close to train stations and local buses. The apartment was clean and tidy with everything you need for a short break. The only downside for us was how noisy it could be from the street level through the night, considering you were 34 floors up. The whole building was very quiet internally."
2016-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Larry,"Truly excellent value and convenient access to airport. Was <$10 Uber to International airport, and at 1/3 the price of airport hotel. Shuang was great at communicating and the check-in/check-out process was very simple. House is clean and pretty, with big front yard and gate. While short walk from/to bus station to airport, if coming/leaving at night, do not take the bus (a bit too long of a walk at night in unfamiliar neighborhood). Apartment was very clean and tidy, but gaps in the door led to two cockroaches. Ultimately very worth the price we paid. "
2018-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,23650892,Bronwyn,"Amazing place was spacious and great value. Close to shops and transport. 

Only one thing negative; the traffic could be heard from the bedrooms even with ear plugs on. "
2018-06-16T04:00:00.000Z,23510317,Stuart,"Great apartment, nice and clean, in a great location.  Instructions and communication for checkin were great, making our stay a breeze."
2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,17045341,Elise,"We had a great stay during NYE at Eduardo’s place. Nice apartment with all the facilities needed. Bus stop very close. The bus brings you to Bondi Junction, from which you can come everywhere in the city. Would recommend."
2018-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Suzannah,Danny’s place suited our needs really well.
2018-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Ron And Dee,"Location perfect, very convenient.  Coffee shops and stores available as needed. Flat beautifully furnished with artistic design.

2015-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,7667264,Karen,"Perfect if you enjoy your own company which I do.  Ideally situated for my shopping trip to Ikea.  Really comfy bed. Couple of minutes walk to King Street for shops, bars , restaurants.  On street parking was a bit of a mission later in the evening due to diners but earlier on its a breeze. "
2016-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,7439246,Jacinta,Was a great stay at this little beach pad. We had all we needed well located to the best end of the beach. Simple clean private access made it more like a beach house
2017-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,16549021,Mark,Rob's place is definitely a awesome gem! Great location and an even better host. Will definitely recommend Rob's place for others to visit. Thank you for making our visit to Sydney an awesome one.
2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,9098095,Joshua,"Margaret & John’s hospitality was wonderful & the two dogs as welcoming committee! The outdoor kitchen, fireplace and the train itself are beautiful and the photos don’t do it justice. I’m hoping to send through some new photos we took of the train to further show what’s on offer. Only a short walk away is a river for swimming and there’s a few paths for short bush walks. Anyone interested in the local history will get a kick out of some of the ‘Easter eggs’ around the train- with commemorative photos. Definitely recommend getting the fire going and cooking outdoors- bring bug spray! Would recommend to anyone- and looking forward to staying again."
2018-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,20906161,James,"Neat, tidy, stylish and convenient. A great place with a equally great host."

2015-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Christine,A lovely comfortable and clean room was so nice to be in. The house is great. Got to chat with other guests and really handy to the yummy restaurants and transport. Reasonable price. Would not hesitate to recommend to others.
2018-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Claire,"Great location in Manly, lovely and clean and Ziggy was very easy to deal with. Loved it and would certainly come back!"
2018-07-02T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Rajiv,"Very spacious - our family of four with two grown up kids really stretched out. The apartment was nice and clean, with good amenities, and at the fourteenth floor, we had gorgeous views. The location was truly awesome as well - we could walk to most of the local attractions. The apartment was a bit pricey, but well worth the money. We would stay there again!"

2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,18082902,Roger,"This studio apartment is very practical. In the main space there's a bed, sofa, plus table and two chairs, and there's also a kitchen and bathroom. The kitchen is modern and well-designed, and is fully-supplied with equipment, utensils, crockery, cutlery, tea and coffee, spices, etc. The bathroom is unrenovated but the shower is hot with good pressure, and the space works well. The bed was comfortable.

This top-floor apartment is not overlooked, and has a pleasant urban outlook. The location is supremely convenient to Uni of Sydney, and just far enough from Parramatta Road that noise is not a problem. There are frequent buses nearby, on several routes. Next time I won't bring a car. There are only a few on-site parking spaces, and when these are taken or reserved you may need to park some distance away if you need unrestricted parking."
2018-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,22661818,Brendan,Kate was extremely helpful and the location was amazing. Highly recommend.
2017-07-14T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Shamila,"Susan and Greg's place was perfect for our stay. It was cozy and warm, and private. Greg greeted us when we arrived, and provided a map of local options, and even some breakfast foods and snacks for us while we stayed at the studio -- so sweet! We love Bronte and would absolutely stay here again. "
2016-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Alanna,"Hugo's is a great space, everything you could possibly need for 1-2 people, amazing location with everything at your fingertips and amenable hosts. I had a great stay and would recommend to others!"

2018-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Emily,Hernan was extremely quick to respond to my messages and was extremely hospitable. $20aud Uber ride from the airport - perfect spot for flying in/out of Sydney. Would highly recommend!

2018-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Rachel,"Location was perfect as it's 5 mins walk away from Redfern Station which has trains to many lines. Lots of university students walking around so it's more lively, though the street it's on is peaceful. 5 mins walk another way brings you to lovely cafes (Cafe Ella was my fav for coffee and pastries). Inside the home, it's spacious and cosy with full amenities. Appreciated the electric heated bed during winter. Linda has also been very helpful and responsive when I've got questions on the fly. Thank you!"

The host also very kind, they prepared everything nicely before we came to the apt. They really cooperative and helpful.

Last time i came, they even put welcoming fresh fruits & milk.

Definitely will be back there again when i come to Syd!"

2017-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Damien,"Susan was very welcoming and allow us to check-up earlier in the morning as the room wasn't occupied the day before. The only cons is that the flat is in the Sydney Airport way. So it van be noisy 1 or 2 days per weeks (Noice sharing, the airport way s changing every 2 days). Thank you Susan, I recommand this place. "
2012-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Umesh,David is a great host. Wish i had more time to get to know him :) Apartment was spec and just as shown in the pictures. GREAT location. David also was very helpful and always attended to anything i asked for. Overall a great experience.
2016-09-13T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Rebecca,Nicole had fantastic communication leading up to and during our stay. The apartment was much bigger than represented in the photos and was in a perfect location accessing event venues around Olympic Park. Would easily recommend and stay again... Thanks for making our trip so easy Nicole !!
2018-03-27T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Manju,"Wir haben die letzten Tage unserer Australienreise bei Craige und Leonie verbracht und hatten eine sehr schöne Zeit in Sydney. Die Unterkunft ist super gelegen und ein guter Ausgangspunkt, um Sydney zu erkunden. Man kann den tollen Bondi to bronte walk machen oder von Rose bay aus mit der Fähre nach Central Sydney. Craige und Leonie waren super gastfreundlich und haben viele wertvolle Tipps gegeben. Wir haben uns sehr wohl in ihrem großen schönen Haus gefühlt und wären viel zu gerne länger geblieben! Vielen Dank nochmal!"
2013-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Jacquie,"Wow! What a lovely house! Freshly painted, beautiful old floorboards, ( they are floorboards so a bit squeaky!)  clean minimalist furnishings, and in a QUIET area of Randwick about 17 minutes from the airport, and straight down Coogee Bay Rd  to the ocean. You have the SPOT around the corner, and the best Japanese, on Belmore Rd ( TEN). Best of all there is a garage, because parking in this area is a big problem.  Thank you so much Simone and John for your kindness in accommodating us. We had a lovely stay."
2015-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Chris,"This is a great, well presented apartment. It is located in the heart of Sydney within easy walking distance of everything.

2017-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Chantal,"A gorgeous apartment in the perfect location. Quiet and scenic, right on the beach, but just a minutes walk to all of great restaurants, cafes and shops that Bondi has to offer. Also super-handy to public transport which made it easy to explore wider Sydney from this location."
2018-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Magalie,"Un appartement idéal placé et très bien décoré. Très agréable à vivre !
Le seul bémol : le manque d'isolation vis à vis du bruit dans le couloir et des voisins."
2017-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Hilary,"This is a great little place. We spent 3 nights here and loved it. It's situated in a suburban area, about 10 minutes walk down the hill to Bronte beach and to the path which is part of the sublime Coastal Walk which runs from Coogee to Bondi. Its also about 200m easy walk to the local shops where there are several great restaurants, a fabulous sourdough bakery, a pharmacy and delicious coffee. This is also where you catch the bus which runs very regularly and goes into the city and to Central via Bondi Junction. We just left our car parked outside the house and used the bus during our stay which we found very easy and convenient.
The accommodation is a small separate studio tucked up the back of Susan and Greg's beautiful garden. It has a generous paved area outside with seating which is under a beautiful big old tree which must be gorgeous in summer. 
The position of the studio creates a sense of space and privacy. The studio itself is small but roomy. It is fresh, modern, tastefully decorated, exceptionally clean and very comfortable. Every detail has been thought of, from the shampoo and conditioner supplied, to the iron and mini ironing board, the spare towels, the beach towels, tissues, crockery and cutlery, to the lovely simple breakfast, coffee, and herbal teas. There is a reverse cycle A/C, TV and radio. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was great.
Susan was lovely to deal with, friendly and helpful, and very quick to respond. She and Greg were very welcoming and helpful but then left us to ourselves which is what we like. The studio feels private and separate from the house and is very quiet. We would highly recommend this studio and would be more than happy to stay here again."

Apartment: Clean, comfy and has everything that you can need.
Owner: Very friendly,  has a helpful attitude and assists you in whatever you need.
So triple check = 100% recommended"
2018-04-04T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Paul,"Clean trendy apartment, great location with amazing local tips on local eateries and attractions. Hosts are very quick to respond and more than accommodating."
2017-07-01T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Linus,"Simon and Nicole's place is tiny and clean.

They are easy to communicate with. Although we haven't meet them, but they have responded to every message and provides us some suggestions.

The location is great, 5-10 minutes walk from central station, and 5-10 minutes walk to Crown Street, where the pubs, bars and cafes is located in.
Their guidebook is awesome as well.

If I come to Sydney next time, I will stay in Simon and Nicole's place again."
2018-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Wendy,We enjoyed our stay at this lovely property. Quiet location with a nice private outdoor area adjacent to the garden. Facilities were excellent and the hostess was great to deal with. We would definitely stay here again.

2017-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,12098138,Michael,"Great place right on Tamara Beach. Very cosy and great host who kept in contact prior and through our visit making it very comfortable for us. Easy check in, nice walking areas & very close to cafe's Bondi and surrounding beaches, Bondi Junction for shopping and an easy drive to City. Big spacious apartment with beautiful views and good entertaining areas. And a nice day bed (boat) overlooking beach for the perfect afternoon nap."
2018-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,22005432,Claire,"The bedrooms were comfortable with lots of storage and air conditioning. The bathroom was clean and for longer stays there is a washing machine. The lounge and kitchen and spacious offering a great area to entertain. We made good use of the BBQ too.

The kitchen is well stocked with herbs and spices and all cooking equipment which we had access to.

Treen was fully accommodating with arrival times and any questions we had.

A great stay had by all!"
2018-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,22295401,Alex,cool place to stay and near everything.
2015-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Eoin,"I went to Sydney on a business trip and decided I wanted to get a taste of the coast rather than city. Best decision I ever made. The property is right on Tamarama beach, walking distance from Bondi and Bronte and 20 mins from the city center. The property itself was immaculate and very tasteful. Highly recommend. "
2018-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Kerry,Great place! Super close to the airport and great hospitality!
2018-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Mahmoud,"A nice, modern apartment, great view of the beautiful Hills suburb. It suited our family of five perfectly and we enjoyed our stay."
2018-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,27479560,Peter,Very thoughtful host - providing both a porta-cot and a high chair for my little one...made the stay all that more simpler and easier.
2017-06-08T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Richard,"A welcoming touch was some fresh fruit and a jug of milk in the fridge. A quiet tree-lined street, with a few planes flying over in the evenings (not-too-loud). An easy walk to the restaurants of King Street. We'll stay again."
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,1211285,Sandra,"The apartment is located near Bondi beach, bus services into the city and as stated has good views. Fans were provided to accommodate for no air conditioning. Generally okay and provided a base and adequate. We did find a number of shortcomings which, from a basic starting point left us disappointed. A bottle of wine and some biscuits were there to welcome us.

The place listed a single bed that converted into a king size bed. It doesn't and is more of a child bed. Not great for our adult son who stayed with us. Rather a long list of do & don'ts (don't wear shoes, don't open certain windows, do put on humidifier, do open doors,  caution with worktops etc) suggested a higher standard of apartment than  it turned out to be. The cooker and facilities were not brilliant and no seating on the balcony as shown in the photos).

While not bad it is basic and we were very put off cooking when we found rotting food in the microwave. No TV unless you have iphone. Can be noisy if windows left open. We paid a high price, accepting it was over New Year, it was not the standard we thought we had booked."
2018-07-01T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Alicia,Amazing location!
2015-08-09T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Kimberly,"The apartment was lovely and had a lot of privacy. Love that the view from the bed was the garden itself and there are tables outside you can have breakfast at. Amenities were provided and Susan even stocked the fridge with breakfast. Susan was very helpful and even remembered to book a cab for me to the airport when I completely forgot. Neighbourbood is wonderful and safe. Location is near the beach (only 5min walk) and walking distance to the supermarket, restaurants and cafe. Great stay and a highlight during my trip to Australia. Bronte and Susan's apartment is highly recommended! "
2018-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Stephanie,"Simon & Nicole's place is perfect for a couple or individual traveler heading to Sydney. GREAT location, super clean place, lovely terrace for breakfast. The WiFi is great, perfect for a working holiday. Nicole and Simon were both so helpful with local tips as well as making sure we had all of the amenities we could ask for. Another perfect Airbnb belonging to likeminded lovers of travel that reminds you why you're a part of this community in the first place."
2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Carrie,Great location but a car is necessary for most travellers.
2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Steven,What an awesome place. View. Location. Just perfect.  Hugo and Pam excel in their service to their guests. From communication and directions to on the spot support for any unforseen help needed. They were great. Steve Jackson

We Had the chance to spend some time with Julie and she is such à nice person! ""Don't be afraid to ask"" that' s what she taught us. And indeed, she does her best to Help, provides pieces of advise .. she now is more than a host, but a friend ! We did not see Wyatt much, but he was very welcoming and cheerful! 
If you are planning a trip to Sydney you should definitely stop at their lovely house !"

2015-05-25T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Andrea,"This was my first Airbnb stay, and what a great start. No nasty surprises, the accommodation was just as described, comfy, clean, great almost inner city location and affordable. The information sheet provided with the accommodation was perfectly understandable & helpful for anyone who is not a Sydney local, like me. And the little touches that make it special were unexpected but lovely...the Lindor Balls, the Frangipani toiletries, all add to a relaxing experience.Duncan and Ashlee were fabulous hosts who are happy to be as involved as you want them to be and have a wealth of info on many things, as well as the odd anecdote or two. Very easygoing and personable, couldn't fault them! Couldn't be happier with my first visit, and hopefully I will have the opportunity to stay with them again in the future, now that I've fallen in love with Rozelle just a little bit more."
2018-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,20374683,Heng Tsui,Good location. Cozy and Warm house.
2017-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Victoria,"Victoria was a wonderful host, so hospitable and kindly anticipated our needs while in Sydney. The apartment was beautifully well kept and the location was perfect - quaint locale with convenient shops, cafes and restaurants a stone's throw away without having that crowded or city-like feel.  Zinc, across the street, was our favorite breakfast spot during the visit.  Would definitely choose to stay again on any future visits!"
2018-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,22346270,Eric,"Sam & Penny (His wife) are so gracious and generous with their time & hospitality. The room was as described, very comfortable space to stay in, all shared zones are clean & tidy. This place is the definition of bang for your buck, and you'll make two lovely friends along the way too."

George and Lucia were very responsive and I would strongly recommend booking if in the area :)"

Thanks Michelle"
2017-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Hannah,"Fantastic apartment in a fabulous location. Beware there are no fly screens on any window and given the location in the bush, with a pond outside one main window, mosquitoes were fierce. It was also disappointing that there was no hot water."
2017-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,5581269,Eloise,"Michy’s place is a real gem in a secluded and peaceful spot.
Right across the road is Pittwater for a swim and around the corner is Forage for a great coffee! 
Michy is an amazing host and was so hospitable and kind! A great place to stay we couldn’t recommend more!"
2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Stephanie,Great location. Clean and affordable. Host very prompt with replying and accomodating for requests. Would highly recommend
2018-11-05T05:00:00.000Z,20865085,Frauke,"Great apartment.  We were amazed at what Jenny provided. It was not only a generously sized, lovely decorated and sparkling apartment with great aircon and perfect location to beach and public transport but Jenny was professional and  charming. From brand new beach towels to beautiful soft and large bathroom towels and crisp, ironed lovely bed linen to a fridge with essentials and a larder with coffee, tea, biscuits it felt like a home away from home.  The price service ratio is phenomenal. No wonder she’s booked well in advance.  We already recommended her to friends from overseas."
2016-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,5993432,Jory And Brandon,Great little place in central location. Helpful hosts. Thank you!
2015-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Matthew,"I travelled with 7 companions and we thoroughly enjoyed staying at this property.
Location trumps everything - especially in a city like Sydney - and this house is perfectly situated and really good value for money.
Supermarkets, pubs, restaurants, night life, the CBD, opera house and harbour are only a short walk away.
The views from the east facing bedrooms are spectacular, both with good sized private balconies to enjoy.
Jeremy is a delightful and responsive host.  He was always quick to respond to messages and to answer any questions. 
I was worried about parking because this house doesn't have a carport or driveway. But Jeremy has an arrangement with a nearby car wash that charges only $20 a day.  It was convenient and hassle-free.   When comparing other options for a group of 8 or so, this house is excellent value for money.  At around $60 a head per night, you won't find anything in Sydney for that price - let alone a gorgeous house like this!  "
2017-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,5993432,Eva,"Appartement idéalement situé à a peine 5min à pied de la station king cross. Parfait pour rayonner dans la ville en utilisant les transports en communs. Sinon, à pied, il faut compter 30min pour rejoindre le CBD, ce qui est plutôt cool ! 
Contrairement à ce que certaines personnes m'avaient dit, le quartier de king cross ne craint pas. Je ne me suis jamais sentie en insécurité, même tard le soir.
L'appartement est très sympa, lit confortable, grande cuisine, télévision, machine à laver pour 3$ au Rez de chaussé. Le seul inconvénient est la baignoire qui commence à être vieille et rouillée, mais cela reste amplement suffisant pour prendre une douche. 
L'hôte est très sympathique et attentionné, donne de bonnes recommandations et s'assure que tout se passe bien et que l'on ne manque de rien par message. 
Je recommande ce logement ! "
2016-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Rebecca,"Wayne and Kate were really nice and available to answer all our questions within minutes of asking them. The apartment is basic, but it had everything we needed, was clean and the location and views were amazing! "

2018-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,20865085,Elen,Blissful Bronte was such a beautiful place to say. Only a 5 minute walk to beautiful Bronte beach. Jenny was so lovely and helpful. There was nice touches to the place - including some milk and English muffins which was so nice considering we didn't get there until late. The place/amenties/furniture were all lovely and immacutely clean. A walk from bronte  to bondi is must. Jenny recommended having lunch at the Bondi icebergs (casual bistro area) which we did. We are so glad she told us about it as we had no idea you could eat there and it was lovely with a beautiful view! It is also super easy to get transport from the street or beach. Will definitely be recommending blissful bronte to friends and family!
2018-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,21851474,Sophie,"Really nice little place, and Kristin was really friendly and helpful. I had a problem with the wifi and they got it fixed straight away. Good communication, too."

2017-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Dominika,"I stayed one night long at this place. The host is very supportive, takes care about all requests, the communication was very good! Thank you again for letting me stay at your place! "
2017-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Ashlyn,"Can't say enough good things about our stay at Susan's guesthouse! The place is beautifully decorated and was very clean when we arrived. Everything we could think of was provided, including a map of the area & info on restaurants  (5 minute walk to restaurants and the coast!). Susan was always easy to get in touch with & quick to respond when we had any questions. Above all else, Susan & Greg's hospitality was what stood out the most. They were so thoughtful (bringing us bagels one morning, lending us peroxide when my husband came down with an ear infection). I don't think we've had a more pleasant Airbnb experience. Highly recommend staying here!"
2016-06-07T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Peter,"Angela was a fantastic host! She was very friendly and responded to any questions that I had.

The apartment was nice, clean, and most of all comfortable! It had all the amenities that I needed. Wifi worked perfectly. Great location as it was within walking distance to many sights such as the Rocks, Opera House, Harbor Bridge, Darling Harbor, and George Street (shopping district). It was also conveniently located near the train station if I needed to head someplace far and to the ferries (that I took to Taronga Zoo and Manly Beach).

Would highly recommend Angela as a host and her apartment to others!"
2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,26340840,Marni,"This place was lovely and was great for our family with young kids.  It would also be a fabulous entertaining space out the back decking and backyard for entertaining a group.  The house has two living areas, the front room and back deck which is well contained and warm for day to day meals and living also.  Both the caretakers and owners were very attentive to our requests and communication.  This place has everything you need to be very comfortable.  The place was super clean and tidy, everything as the pictures show.  We loved our stay, thank you! "

The sauna worked wonderfully, and the beach towels were huge and thick! Don't underestimate the value of the birds and the books!  We definitely recommend this place.  Pittwater paradise indeed.  :)

2017-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,15923846,Jenny,"The house was in a perfect location, super close, and walkable to everything. Suzanna was really nice and easy to work with. She gave us a lot of helpful local suggestions and let us check in really early. The house was really clean and all the bathrooms have been remodeled. It's an older home that has very steep stairs and some creaky doors but overall a great place for a large group!"

2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Kevin,Millie's apartment is just as advertised. Very clean and tidy but it got a bit cold at night due to no heating system. Millie was prepared though and supplied two thick blankets which made up for it. Overall great experience and very close to the opera house and bridge.
2015-07-06T04:00:00.000Z,4499095,Geoff,"Our stay at Dino's apartment was fantastic. The lead-up was straightforward with clear communication between Dino and us. The apartment is very well appointed, with more than meets the eye . The main bed was the most comfortable we have slept in! Location is brilliant with coffee shops, markets and transport close by. Great walks in the early morning around Rushcutters Bay and one morning we walked into the CBD via Wooloomooloo, the gardens and the Opera House. Rick managed our arrival and departure in a friendly and welcoming manner, and I would have no hesitation in recommending this apartment - I am sure we will stay there again."
2016-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Chris,Hernan was a great host..we didn't cross paths all that much during my stay however everything I needed was there.Thank you mate! Highly recommend a great place to stay!

2017-06-01T04:00:00.000Z,17915093,Vera,"The flat was very clean and I appreciated the tea and breakfast materials Allen left for me. The bedroom was nice and clean and the bed was very comfortable, plus there was a heater as it was quite cold in Sydney! The flat is about a 12 minute walk from Bondi Junction, which is great for shopping and transport connections. It's a nice quiet home in a safe neighbourhood.

Although comfortable for my stay, the room pictured isn't entirely accurate - there was natural light from the skylight but the window itself actually looks out onto a grey brick wall about 6 inches away - not the pretty view pictured. 

The flat has a well equipped kitchen and amenities you'd need for a leisure or business stay (ironing, wifi, table)."

The house is located in the city center close to everything, including the opera house by 10 minutes walking. Great public transport. The roomates were very friendly. The room has a great balcony for summer and everything you might need. Thank-you guys for hosting me. I miss you."

2017-06-10T04:00:00.000Z,10091713,Cassandra,Staying at Ben's place was fantastic! The view was perfect and the apartment itself was great. It was right in the middle of everything and was full of awesome geeky paraphernalia. Ben's guidebook was also very useful and I greatly appreciated having it. I would definitely choose this as a place to stay again if I get a chance to return to Sydney.
2018-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Brady,"Location and view can't be beat. It's across the street from Bondi beach, right next to all the restaurants and bars you could want. The view from the flat is amazing, and you can watch the sunrise from the unit. Despite being a studio, the flat felt much bigger. Check-in was easy, and it had everything you need for a great trip. Would love to stay here again!"

The neighborhood is wonderful and provides a nice break from the bustle of Sydney, yet is easily accessible to all the great spots by ferry.   The apartment is beautifully appointed and affords plenty of privacy.  The breakfast and wine provided were delicious.  Neil and Jane were exceptionally responsive and helpful prior to, and throughout, our stay.  We truly enjoyed meeting them and can't wait to return!  Highly recommend staying here!"

The partial view on bondi beach is a bit disappointing but since everything else is almost perfect, this view is definitively secondary. Would warmly recommend Anita's appartment "

Most of all, house is located in near beach side and beach swimming pool. - This can explain about the best benefits for choosing this house!!
In addition, House is really clean, tidy and spacious.
It is easy to park the car near the house, so no need to worry about the car park.
Fred is a nice and kind host that you don't worry about asking him

It is a good experience to stay in this AirBnB in Syd

2016-09-12T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Jill,"Fantastic location with super easy access to public transport (we travelled via Kings Cross station every day). Communal areas on interior of building in need of brightening but sort of adds to the charm as is. Apt is small but comfortably accommodated 2 adults and our daughter on a blow up mattress and had everything we needed. Stairs are a but of a hike with heavy suitcases but nothing we haven't encountered frequently in our travels o/s. Paul and Mary (house cleaner) were very responsive to any communication and kindly accommodated us when we needed to checkin early and to store luggage before departure flight. Night crowd outside a little loud at times but it didnt stop us sleeping. Colourful and cool area - would definitely stay again.  (Recommend Beer & Dumplings for take away, pastry shop below for delicious treats, and weekend market for great healthy interesting food)"
2014-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Sharon,"Our stay at Simone's home was everything we expected and more. Great location, within walking distance from shops and beaches. Short cab ride to Allianz football stadium and Randwick race course which was perfect for our weekend plans. The house was very comfortable and had everything you would need. The off street parking was an added bonus. Would definitely recommend Simone house to anyone wishing to stay in the Randwick area. I know we will be back! "
2017-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Roisin,"House and location excellent. Across from Hyde Park, 10 mins from botanic gardens and Darling Harbour. My family of 6 had an wonderful time in Sydney. Staying in Philips house was perfect. Had everything we needed and more. Host very attentive.  Would highly recommend. xx :)"

2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,24360345,Jim,"Our very first ever AirBnB transaction.  

Very adequate and as described. 
Great location-short walk to transit and area shops, cafes, restaurants, grocery store. 
Area can be noisy, but apartment is very quiet once balcony door is closed-no issues when sleeping
Building itself was clean and very quiet-rarely did we see anyone else. 
Ian was generally quick to respond but not always as helpful as expected in resolving issues
Amenities were provided but minimal/sparse
TV (one of our requirements) was problematic and was never really got resolved to our satisfaction. 
Apartment was generally clean but some areas could use additional attention. 

We were thinking of renting a car but didn’t. In hindsight it was a good move as street parking while available, free spaces weren’t plentiful.  Again, public transit was nearby and more than adequate. 

Nothing major that would prevent us recommending staying here to others."
2017-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,5993432,Jilian,"A lovely and central apartment. Comfortable and well equipped. Loved the very cute bedroom nook. I was warned beforehand that the bath was leaking, but all the rest worked fine. The place is dark, but the bed is next to a big window so you don't suffer from it. "
2019-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,22536824,Kirsty,"Super chill vibe, adorable dog and great location. Only a 5 min walk to Train Station which makes getting around super easy.

2018-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,13333143,Birgit,Central accomodation in Manly in a modern style. The apartment is on the top floor and you have a little bit of ocean view. It is very gut supplied with kitchen affairs and also different sorts of cappuccino and tea are available. All the furniture is in white and in the bed you can sleep very well.

It was near the Central station and there was a small supermarket nearby which closed late, there was also lots of food around and was nearby the famed Bourke Street Bakery. The place was clean and the amenities were amazing, we could see that every thought was put into the decoration and we could find everything we needed. Everything was great and we will be back again!"

2017-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,16221015,Orlaith,"I would recommend Omio's place to anyone!
The views are breathtaking.. You can see Sydney harbour, the bridge, and the opera house on the skyline, as well as the sea. The pictures don't do it justice!

2015-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Cass & Ian,"The backyard cabin was like a secluded writer's retreat! So peaceful and homely, well stocked mini-kitchen too and a beautiful balinese style bed. There's very close by access to an almost private beach and jetty/swimming area, good place to watch the sunset and sip some BYO champers!
Michy was a fabulous host, warm and friendly, and not only did she let us check in early, but also gave us a lift to Jonah's for lunch as it's a little difficult to get a taxi in the area. Highly recommend staying here for a romantic getaway from the city!"
2017-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,David,"Craige & Leonie's home is very spacious and they are a very relaxed couple.

A very quiet location with on street parking that was never a problem. The house is full of charm and Jennifer's bedding and towels are of the highest quality and cleanliness. Jennifer was so generous and welcoming, giving us a walk through of all that we would need to know to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The kitchen was fully stocked for our use and Jennifer had thoughtfully provided breakfast provisions for us  - which we gratefully used - enjoying a leisurely start to the day and breakfast and coffee in the garden. Position of the house is excellent - walking distance to the shopping centre, ferry and bus transport, not to mention how easy it was to access the house with the help of (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. My friends and I can not recommended this property highly enough!"
2015-11-04T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Terri,"My partner and I spent two nights in Paul and Luke's lovely apartment. This place is a gorgeous little base for exploring Sydney!

2018-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Naomi,"Louise’s place was really nice. The rooms and beds were as described and nice and clean. The only downside was that the parking was really inconvenient. There wasn’t parking guaranteed for us, and the back streets weren’t clean whether it was one way or not, so it was a bit dangerous. There was only two visitor spots that could only fit small cars, not recommended for big cars. 
Other than that, everything else was awesome. Was a very homey and cute place with heating and a nice TV."
2013-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Alice,"Cath's beautiful little studio was the perfect place to visit Sydney and the local neighborhood of Merrickville.

Check in and check out was a breeze."
2018-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,22536824,Robert,"We stayed at Clare’s place for 4 nights in Sydney. Everything about it was amazing. Great central location, with the public transportation leaving from just a few minutes by walk. Newtown itself is a vibrant neighborhood with lots of nice bars and restaurants, but Clare’s place is secluded and very silent. Clare provided us with some useful local tips, and is really friendly. The room is spacious with a nice bed, and Mollie is the cutest puppy dog you will get to meet!! Will definitely recommend the place, we will come back here once again in Sydney!"
2016-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Sonia,"l'host è stato molto accogliente, mi ha dato pure un mano con la valigia che pesava ben 25 kili!! è stato molto cordiale, e molto disponibile a qualsiasi domanda.

2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,20906161,Russell,"Where do i start. 
This is a fantastic location, right beside Central train station. If you wanted to walk the town, you had great access to walk to Circular Quay, Paddy's Market  or Darling Harbour.  Your were pretty well within walking distance to grocery stores, restaurants and liquorland to name a few.  The apt is kept in great condition and had comfortable beds.  The balcony was a great place to wind down for the evening.  WiFi is provided and was pretty solid. 
Our host, Alexey, was always on top of things.  He met us upon our arrival and was always just an email away with quick responses to any questions i had. If you want a host that is looking out for your best interests, and is a great communicator Alexey fits the bill.
Thanks for a great week Alexey!"

2018-04-12T04:00:00.000Z,22308786,Sally,We had a fantastic stay with plenty of room for a family of 3 teenage boys.  The location was ideal (a quick stroll down to the rockpool and beach each morning for a swim before breakfast) and the views from the balcony are breathtaking.  We sipped drinks watching the sunset and city lights begin to twinkle. The apartment seems practically brand new and is perfectly equipped with everything you need.  Thanks for a lovely Coogee holiday - we'll definitely be back.

2015-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Jimmy,"Linda was a lovely host and has a very lovely home. Which is close to restaurants, public transport and all other things you could need. It was very easy getting around the city and surrounding areas thanks to the comprehensive information provided to us upon arrival. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend staying at Linda's apartment to anyone looking for accommodation."
2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,12098138,Leigh,Set between Bondi beach and Bronte beach which are easy to walk to. Superb local beach for family and easy to grab an uber to the city. really enjoyed the location and weather.
2017-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,20578419,Karen,"Family of five (including 2 small kids) came to stay at Max's place. Max was such a generous and accommodating host and allowed us to check-in earlier upon our request. Fantastic location near Central train station and bus stops, and easy walk to Paddy's Market/ Chinatown/ Powerhouse Museum. Apartment is clean, spacious, and has all the amenities travelers could possibly need (i.e. cooking utensils, plenty of dishes and cutlery, dishwasher, full-length mirrors on the closet doors, built-in wardrobes with hangers, airconditioning, washer/dryer). Would definitely recommend this home to families with kids or up to 6 adults."
2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Elke,My husband and I just returned from Evelyn's place over the Oct long weekend. We had such a wonderful stay and didn't want to leave. Evelyn and her husband were so welcoming and we felt right at home

Thanks again Michele :)"

2017-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Deborah,"Loved this apartment.  It is located across from beautiful Hyde Park.  You can easily walk to the botanical gardens, many museums and art galleries, the opera house and much more.  The apartment itself is beautiful, nicely furnished, has all the amenities you would want including coffee, tea, milk, cookies, fruit and more.  There is a convenience store right next to it.  Desiree could not have been warmer or more helpful. She was available any time we had a question.  We already asked to book another stay and we will recommend her place to friends."

2017-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,1321603,Claire,"A charming B&B with lots of history and character. Ann took care of us and spoilt us with a lovely breakfast each morning. Not great for young families, but lovely for a couple."
2018-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,23493822,Chironjit,A great room in a nice neighborhood. Great host who provided all the required amenities and who was very helpful when needed
2017-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,5469086,Sandra,"This small apartment is really well located above Bronte beach, with a longish but attractive walk to the beach. The outlook was through trees with bird song and lovely sunrises. There is a nice big private car park and everything we needed was there. No aircon but a good fan made sleeping easy and the bed was comfortable. We found it hard to manage the TV and more instructions would be helpful. Anitta answered us on email when necessary and we enjoyed our stay. We would stay there again. "
2019-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,24863216,Maya,"Within walking distance to the beach, this sparkling clean studio was perfect for our stay in Bronte."

A really good address!"

2015-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Levi,"We stayed at Mal's place right on Bondi Beach for four days and it was HUGE! For a family of four, it was really great because we could spread out. The kitchen was also great and had full sized appliances. The beds were dreamy and the location, if you like to be ocean front, was amazing. We rented a car which now in hindsight was only good for heading out to the zoo or back to the airport because parking around there was awful. And really, there was enough to do right around there so we barely used the car anyway. Mal came over and met us and showed us around the apartment a bit. He actually brought us bread, milk, butter and orange juice, which we were not expecting at all. Plus, he gave us a bit of history on the place, the neighborhood, and a bit on Sydney which was great. He was very friendly and we enjoyed talking with a local. Internet was good and there was a washer and dryer on the roof, too, which was convenient. Just get some coins for it. Highly recommend. I am thankful for AirBNB reviews bc we have stayed in some awesome places over our travels!"
2015-06-21T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Carol,"The listing was as described. Didn't get to meet Miss D, all queries we responded to very promptly either by SMS or email.

All instructions were clearly provided. 

Miss D assisted us with our arrival and departure times.

The bed was very comfortable, the pillows were too big (though this is a personal choice) so would have been good if other options were available. Was a little put off to see hairs in the bed ( just hoping it was from the person changing the sheets).

The room was clean as well as the bathroom and kitchen.

It would have been good to have a television either in the room or the lounge area.

Also first impressions, would be great to see the front garden looking a bit more loved.

Location is very convenient and I would stay again.

Thank you Miss D"
2018-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,21851474,Lindsay,"A beatifully designed studio apartment, well connected for city. Great hosts."
2018-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Lisa,Great apartment. So close to the city yet in a quiet neighbourhood to get away from the hustle and bustle. And an amazing dinner venue Olvolo 1888 just around the corner. Recommend and will be staying again.
2016-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,1944996,Paul,"Where do I start? The neighbourhood is first class. During our seven day stay, we had brunch in one of Surry hills many quaint little cafes every morning, each no farther than a 5 minute walk. The food was incredible as was the coffee. You're two minutes away from an awesome little wine bar on crown street. Bus stops are a short walk away which take you to Bondi Beach in minutes and Central Station is a ten minute walk where we took an train to the Blue Mountains  (recommend that). The apartment itself is excellent. Really cosy, clean and tidy (with Netflix too if you've had an active day). I'm really pleased with our stay and would thoroughly recommend  it! Look no further!!"
2017-06-30T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Karan,"Would recommend if you need a place to crash and experience Sydney. Checking out the buses to the Manly Wharf and the Ferry to the CBD was a thrilling experience. No need for a car to drive around. 
There are nearby restaurants and Supermarkets for convenience as well as a lovely complementary breakfast provided by the host. "
2017-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,8277472,Jimmy,"Elizabeth y Simon son grandes anfitriones, con una casa muy bonita y confortable para alojarse, su hospitalidad y el lugar son recomendados."

2018-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Katherine,"Desireé and Julian’s apartment was a perfect place to explore Sydney from - and delicious Darlinghurst restaurants nearby. They had thought of everything, and we really appreciated the homely touches. The bed is very comfy, there is plenty of wardrobe space, and a comfy couch when a night in is in order. Despite the location right near Hyde Park, it is very quiet and we were not bothered by any noise during our stay. Desireé and Julian were lovely hosts and we appreciated the clear directions and easy check-in and check-out. We would love to stay here again when we’re in Sydney again!"
2018-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,19641701,Jon,"Laura’s apartment was great - fantastic location with amazing views, clean and comfortable. We particularly liked the large kitchen, air conditioner and iron and ironing board. Thanks Laura!"

The house is very pretty we enjoyed a pool, a wonderful open kitchen, a beautiful barbecue area everything is very clean. The house is close to the city just a short walk to the train and 20min drive. We would absolutely recommend this room and would come back if we are visiting Sydney again.

Linda is very friendly, responsive, took time to check in with us during our stay to make sure we are good and accommodating. A pity we didn't meet her during our stay. But her attention to details and making sure her guests are well taken care of is remarkable. 

On the apartment, it was fantastic. Location was awesome and it has everything we need. Feels like home, would certainly come back again if we visit Sydney :)"

They are both really lovely, laid back and have a great attitude towards Airbnb. The property itself was exactly as described, very clean and in an awesome location. The prepaid opal cards were a huge help and all the advice to help with our trip was very appreciated. Our first trip to Sydney and it couldn't have been better. We would definitely stay here again and really recommend it! You will really struggle to find better value on Airbnb let alone in Sydney! Thanks again guys!! "

The studio was very clean and comfortable, and every detail had been thought of, which made our visit very easy and relaxing. Perfect size for a couple!
The location of the studio was perfect for us too, a couple of minutes walk to a beautiful beach and close to the entry into the National Park, yet really peaceful.
We really enjoyed our weekend away, and would highly recommend the studio for a peaceful and relaxing getaway. "
2018-03-29T04:00:00.000Z,21988560,Anna,Tim’s place has great access to public transport and is a quick uber ride to the airport. Comfy bed and very clean - would highly recommend to anyone with an early flight or in need of a place to stay for a night!
2018-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,27009904,Tiffany,Tim & Mel’s place was phenomenal! Great location as it was less than a 5 minute walk from Green Square Station. Sparkling clean and bright room.

2016-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Rebekah,Great room and great facilities. Incredibly close to everything you need in Newtown and only a few minutes to the train station. House felt clean and secure. Thank you !

The flat was just as you see in the photos, amazing location right opposite the beach and within easy walking distance of anything you could want to do in Bondi. The rooftop is the cherry on top and the perfect spot to kick back after a day on the beach. Everything worked, the place was clean and we loved it. Would definitely come back!"

2017-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Lauren,"This is the best location you can ask for. You're in the center of everything. Apartment is nicer than what you would get in a hotel room. They're doing construction a street over for a light rail, so ear plugs are necessary. But if you're looking for something that's affordable and in an unbeatable location, then you won't be disappointed. "
2014-05-03T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Elaine,We had a great experience at the Garden Studio. It was so clean and comfortable with every need provided for. I had wondered about the ladder to the bed as in my 60s with a not good knee but it was fine and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. We loved the shower and bathroom provisions and the kitchen was great. We had delicious breakfast every morning with everything provided by Cath and only needed to purchase yoghurt.We had a weekly travel pass and there was a short walk to regular buses and the new Dulwich to Central light rail line which we used daily in combination with rail. Highly recommended .
2018-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,19376053,Tracy,"The landlord is very enthusiastic. We have informed them all the matters needing attention before we go, so we can check in very quickly and conveniently when we arrive. The house is located in the downtown area. It is easy to get to the downtown attractions. There is a central railway station nearby and it is convenient to go farther."
2019-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,15889399,Naomi,"Steven & Peta have a very comfortable, private, secure and modern unit at the back of their property.  We have enjoyed many visits over the past years.  They are friendly hosts who respond to any requests immediately.  The location is perfect - walking distance to Petersham train station, bus stops and the town centre including restaurants and shops.  It is quiet, has a TV, reverse cycle aircon, a lounge, iron and a kitchenette - everything you need for a comfortable stay.  We wouldn't hesitate to recommend their place."
2018-08-03T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Nicole,"Amazing! We used Jeremy’s place as our base for a team business trip to Sydney. Jeremy was extremely responsive and did what he could to accomodate us dropping bags off early - breezy as checkin process. 

What we loved about this house was everything. There are 4 bedrooms, 3 which each have their own balcony. The top rooms balcony has views of the city and the sunsets are STUNNING. Great place for evening wines. (It would be great if there were some fairy lights here is a small lantern).

The kitchen has everything you could need, so would be very comfortable for families or long stays. 

The neighbourhood is safe and easy to explore. There are many great cafes within walking distance.

Lookout for the Neighbours friendly cat, Fudge. 

We will stay here again in a heartbeat!
"
2015-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Sara,"Marcella is a great individual. She was more than happy for us to check in earlier. The location is really nice, only 2 min walk to a beautiful beach and also there are many great cafes around. However house was a bit dusty and older than we were thinking. There were some insects and cockroaches around. It wasn't big enough for 10 adults specially if you are traveling with family as there wasn't enough space in the living room for late night gatherings!  "
2019-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Patti,"This two bedroom apt. Has a nice partial view of water and boats. However, it only sleeps four adults comfortably unless you can sleep in a children’s metal cot with a thin foam pad, both of which were broken when we got there. It took several   texts, frustration and waiting, but we did get a functional cot that night. Having only two nights in Sydney, we didn’t need the aggravation. Also, we were really grossed out by the black mold in the bathroom shower grout lines."
2018-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Michael,"Great little place! Good spot to explore Sydney from. Paul’s communication was great, and he was very helpful. Would recommend!"
2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,18338274,瑞,"Bill很贴心的提醒我们一点钟可以提前入住了｡对于凌晨七点到达的一大家子早休息一个小时很重要,关键是感觉到了切实的关心｡
距离鱼市场步行十分钟,然后从鱼市场距离daring harbor十分钟,中间经过一个儿童乐园不错｡继续步行十分钟就到了海德公园,然后一路沿着公园走到皇家公园｡临近海边看当地人锻炼身体,读书,几个朋友喝啤酒都十分惬意｡
悉尼核心区步行一个半小时够了｡带着孩子们走走停停,步行是最好的选择｡
感谢Bill准备的旅游建议｡桌子上放了一大本书｡各种电器使用说明,到远近的商店信息｡很用心的人｡屋里各地带回来的艺术品｡泰国的,中国的元素不少｡推荐大家来悉尼住在Bill家｡再次感谢"
2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,22308786,Shane,"This property is exactly as pictured, which does not do justice to how good this place is. 

Spotless and everything is in great condition, bathrooms are clean and the outdoor area is the perfect spot to spend an afternoon overlooking the water. 

Plenty of space and great contact from the host make this the perfect place to stay. Hope to be back!!!"
2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,888107,骏,"房子虽然不在市中心,但出门走1､2分钟就有公交到central station,所以出行还是很方便｡如果自驾来,街边都可免费停车｡附近也有一个超市可以买到日常要用的东西｡有独立的房间,共用客厅､厨房和卫生间等公共空间,因为房东很好相处,所以也很自由方便｡另外小宋和Julie 还提供了许多关于旅行､出租等等信息的帮助｡总之,值得推荐｡"

2015-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Pauline,"Rachel met me on the morning of my arrival and showed me round the house.  The house was exactly as described, the beds were very comfortable and everything was of a high quality.  I preferred living in Mosman to the centre of Sydney.  It has a lovely community feeling but the city is easily accessible by bus or ferry.  We ate breakfast and dinner within a very short distance of the house and there was a large range of places to choose from, all providing excellent food.  Balmoral beach was also a short walk away which I think is the most perfect beach in Sydney."

2018-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Juliana,"Paul’s place is in the perfect location. Walking distance to the wharf, restaurants, shops and beach. Good size apartment and met all of our needs."
2013-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Micael,"After 10 days in such a fantastic terrace, I can say that Natasa is simply the perfect host, and even better person! Friendly, funny and flexible, she is always ready to help, to have a conversation and she makes you feel like at home as you enter the house. The house is clean and tidy, and the kitchen and living room are spacious and with all you may need. The room itself, with double bed, is a perfect and very comfortable place to relax as at home. The house is perfectly located 1 minute (or even less) form Petersham train station, from where you get to the city in a 10 minutes ride. There is also a supermarket and shops nearby, which make it easy to get provisions. Of course, the house has Wifi connection, which is fast and reliable.
This has been the first time I book a room through Airbnb and it has been such a fantastic experience that I will definitely consider Airbnb for further stays, and if in Sydney, at Natasa’s place for sure!

2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Kieran,"My girlfriend and I had a delightful stay with Belinda, the place was in a quiet and relaxing location with perfect access to a nice quiet beach for some snorkelling. The property was well equipped (we made great use of the extensive kitchen utensils as there was few eating out options in the town) and beautifully laid out - the photos on the walls were stunning. The veranda was a nice place to sit and chill out and was nicely enclosed by the garden so it was peaceful and nicely separated from the house. Belinda was very welcoming and accommodating.  "
2016-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Ben,Fabulous apartment & fabulous hosts! Look forward to staying here again!!!

2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Michael,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Angela’s - a fantastic place to spend a few nights in Sydney’s Northern Beaches, either to explore or just relax. The property is located in a quiet, residential area but in walking distance of Avalon beach, and all local amenities. The space is beautifully decorated and maintained, with lots of space for 4 adults to share and enjoy. Angela was an extremely thoughtful host (extra thanks for the wonderful food and drink supplies that welcomed us on arrival) and easy to contact throughout. Would highly recommend staying here, wish we could have stayed longer!"
2018-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,George,"I can fully recommend this stay. Susan and Greg are great hosts. The studio is fully self contained, quiet and private. Bronte is a terrific location, particularly if you like the beach."

2017-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Jamie,"Beautiful home on a nice quiet street just around the corner from shops and restaurants. Walking distance to Coogee beach. The garage is very useful and the house itself is lovely. Thanks for the bottle of wine cooling on arrival, it was a really nice stay. Zero complaints!"
2018-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,1143151,Jana,"The apartment is in a good location, only a very short walk from public transport and with a glimpse of the Harbour Bridge. 

Unfortunately the cleanliness and general  kit out of the place was below expectations. Basic things such as utensils were missing and the light in the main room wasn’t working, just to name a few issues."
2018-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,9080393,Michelle,Lina's accomodation is clean and comfortable. Much roomier than you would imagine and modern for the area. Lina is happy to help with advice. Really enjoyed our accomodation.

2014-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Jasmine,"Staying in this lovely place was truly an amazing experience! Yes the pictures are accurate and the place is located in the perfect spot 2 min walk from the bus stop, nice/safe area and the chance to do lots of shopping. Arnie and his partner were more then welcoming and if you get the chance why not have a look at Arnie's great art work. 
The bed was soft and comfy wasn't much noise at all. I also want to say thank-you for dealing with my last minute booking. I highly recommend anyone to stay at this listing you will not regret it I promise. I can't wait to stay again!!"
2018-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,18130053,Eoghan,"Execellent apartment in a great location, shops, trains etc all located within 5 minutes walk. Train only 8-10 minutes to city centre and all the main spots.
Uber cheap to any beaches - bondi/coogee or even to cbd. 
Apartment was immaculate with everything you would need. Much better than any hotel.
Any advice or help Evan had replied within minutes.
Excellent stay, didn’t want to leave so got our own apartment across the road! "
2017-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Pal,"What can I say about the hosts Lee & Craige. What a lovely genuine couple and nothing was too much for them. They let us check in early as our flight got in st 7am and usually check in is at 2pm. They left some hints and suggestions of what to do in the room with contact details and everything we needed to know about the area, where to get public transport, eat and go out. They even lent us beach towels. Lee lent me her straightener. WiFi too. Bathroom was super clean with a great shower. They got us a cab when an uber let us down. It was like being at home abroad. Very casual down to earth couple. In an ideal location near Bondi Beach. Just a 5 min walk but yet away from the hustle & bustle of the parade opposite beach. First time booking an Airbnb and so glad it was such a happy experience."
2017-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,13595339,Tony,"Cozy studio that is very clean and comfortable.  Location is *fantastic* -- we walked to everything we wanted to see in Sydney and there is easy access to groceries/food, if you prefer to eat in.

Mariana and Don are amazing hosts-- they were accessible for anything we needed and very easy to communicate with ahead of time.

One blip: the neighboring apartment was very loud in the middle of the night (twice), but we let Mariana know and I suspect any issue will be resolved."
2016-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Lorraine,"Natasa was a great host. All arrangements  to arrive and access the property  were d xcellent. We sat and chatted, she made me  feel  very welcome.  Petersham is a good area with transport and  restaurants  nearby."
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,1944996,Kylie,"Annie was a fantastic host to deal with - super responsive and flexible - she even left us a bottle of bubbly to start our NYE celebrations early (thanks!) Easy check in and check out, nice, cosy and compact apartment in a good location with plenty of cafes, convenience stores and other eating options nearby. We walked down to Circular Quay and covered other parts of the city by foot which was pretty easy, though there seemed to be lots of buses nearby. Close enough to the CBD without being right in the thick of things. Thanks for having us :-)"
2016-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Helen,"Avalon Beach is a very scenic destination, not far from Palm Beach. Cathy's cosy room was as expected. Great to walk down to nearby Paradise and Clareville Beaches and watch the water craft on beautiful Pittwater. There was a warm welcome from Cathy, very helpful with everything. Hopefully I will return for another stay ..."
2018-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Sophie,Lovely friendly warm couple who went out of their way to help us find our way around Sydney :) suggested us places to go and even let us use their public transportation cards and wrote down the bus routes for is in detail so we wouldn't get lost!!! Clean and pretty house. We were very comfortable and had nice chats with them :) we would definitely recommend staying there! Plus their dogs are so friendly :D Thank you Judith and Paul :)
2018-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,22412815,Eric,Clean and tidy very accessible for us we would recommend it to friends Thank you Leena
2017-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Frances,"Danny was great in accommodating to poor organiseation on my part and allowing us to drop our bags off early, and we were greeted by his brother. Danny's place was super convenient for a few of us staying in the city, however it is in a serious state of disrepair, including bathroom tap, shower doors, wardrobe doors, balcony doors etc. we're all broken in some way. Furniture was of low quality you could feel it, especially the beds. Just seemed like basic cheap furniture, compared to other Airbnbs I have stayed at, the quality of this was poor. Despite the great location and affordable price, myself and the other guests probably would not stay there again. "
2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,18082902,Marion,"Les PLUS : Agréable studio, lumineux, pratique, bien desservi par les bus, lit très confortable, petite cuisine équipée.

Les MOINS : Le bruit des voisins (aucune insonorisation), la douche et le lavabo qui coulent et gouttent en continu, la TV qui ne fonctionne pas, aucun échange ou entrevue avec l'hôte."
2017-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,16070079,Linda,The apartment was well situated. It was a very comfortable place with everything we needed. I highly recommend it.

2017-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,16408272,Mei Tim,"Chloe has been a fantastic host and quick to respond to our needs. The apartment is just next to a train station, CBD shopping areas & tourist attraction, and not to mention a convenient store which makes it a very ideal apartment for a small family to stay. Will definitely love to stay at the apartment again in our next trip to Sydney."
2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,27716426,Andrew,"We enjoyed our stay at Charles place in Redfern.  Unit is in a great location for both Sydney CBD, Redfern, Surry Hills, Waterloo and access to the Airport.  

Unit was spotlessly clean throughout and communication from Charles was excellent at all times.  Keyless access system works well and provides great security.

Although a comfortable stay, the unit is small with no seating area other than 2 small stools in the kitchen, this wasn't a surprise to us as its clearly shown and stated in the listing but could pose problems for longer stays or days where the weather dictates you need to be inside!

Would stay again for 1 or 2 nights when in Sydney."
2018-06-14T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Pangeran,"It was a great experience so modern, clean, neat, perfect stay with friends!"
2017-03-13T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,Yukio,"This place was amazing!

Not only was Hilde one of the best Airbnb hosts we have encountered (attentive, informative, helpful and reachable, when we needed her), the place was fantastically prepared. We stayed in the apartment with our 1-year-old and immediately after our arrival it became apparent that a lot of love and a well-developed attention to detail went into making this place as comfortable as possible. The beds were great, the pool was immaculately maintained (no chlorine = great for kids), the kitchen was well-outfitted with all the essentials and the bathroom stocked with towels. Hilde even went to the trouble of providing our daughter with some toys, which came in very handy.

All in all, Hilde's ""Bundeena Base"" was a great launchpad for us to have some family downtime outside of Sydney. A real gem of a region, which is quite reachable by train/ferry as well as car from the city."
2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Emily,"Great place, with wonderful hospitality and conveniently close to the airport!"

2018-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Ansie,"LOCATION was great, walking distance from Darling Harbor, close easy 12 min walk with luggage from Wynyard Station.  Can get the ferry to Circular Quay and Taronga Zoo, Luna Park, Seaworld, Madame Tussaud and Wildlife Zoo is very close by, everything is walking distance from this apartment.  Reception was prompt and friendly, room was tidy with all you need, washing machine and dryer if needed. It is small, but for a traveler or long stay more than what you will need, 4 people can sleep comfortable."
2016-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Reza Akmal,"It was a pleasure staying with Natasa! Even if she's a really busy person, she made everything possible, that my stay at her place was very enjoyable and comfortable. The place is great and very well located.Petersham Train station just 100meter from house, Sydney International Airport just 15-20 minutes, we using Uber as per suggested by Natasa and costly around 20 Aud from airport to Natasa House,I'd definitely go there again when I come back to Sydney. Thank you!"

2017-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,8130620,Jennifer,"Fantastic family apartment! It is great to have a break away and be able to have a separate room from the kids. 
Sara went above and beyond providing a high chair, port a cot and sharing her daughters toys; our boys loved it.
The view and location was amazing, the apartment clean and stylish. 

We would really like to stay again next time we are in Sydney."
2017-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,16234640,Amy,"Yang’s place is awesome, great location for exploring outer sydney but close enough to get to CBS easily. The apartment is beautiful, clean and had amazing views. As hosts they were outstanding, meeting us a lot later than planned after we hit traffic, showing us to the apartment and helping us get parked. Overall a great property and great hosts."
2016-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,2900140,Ian,"Chocolates, croissants, fruit, eggs, drinks and spreads, dvd's, books, maps, games, all very comfortable and an easy walk to the beach and shops in a nice street with trees. We loved it."
2015-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Louise,"We had such a relaxing time- the garden outlook was beautiful and it was like being in the country in the middle of Sydney! The bed was lush and room cozy (we needed the heater as it was freezing in Sydney this weekend!)
Susan was such a lovely host- she was very welcoming, provided us with great tips for local eateries and everything was within walking distance. We would definitely visit again.... Thank you Susan."

2018-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,12259367,Gilles,"Athena’s apartment is very nice and facilities are excellent. It is very well located close to Sydney CBD and train and ferry stations. It is also very quiet. Check in was easy and Athena answered my questions quickly. For two people, I recommend the place and would return if I had to stay in Sydney CBD."
2019-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,17606304,Liz,Lovely Australian home with real character. Beautiful details and high ceilings. Good to have private outside space. Well appointed galley kitchen. Transport (buses and trains) close by and easy to use. Very comfortable and relaxing space to relax in after busy days in Sydney. We had a lovely time.
2017-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Katherine,"Great location, close to everything downtown. Could use a bit of a thorough cleaning and some extra utensils, however, it was close enough to walk pretty much everywhere you wanted to go down by the CBD, so it was a hit with our group!"
2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Jizi,"The apartment is in a good location, close to town hall and big shopping centers in Sydney. But it’s much smaller than I imagined, quit narrow for 3 people to live there. And it’s very hard to contact with the host when we found there is no quilt cover for the sofa bed."
2016-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Tony,"
Architecturally this is a fabulous building and well located for Mosman. Rachel provided excellent instructions on accessing the property. Unfortunately we did not meet Rachel in person during our stay. "
2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,5923031,Chanele,Narelles Airbnb was the perfect little home away from home! The location was absolutely perfect for us as it was central to everything and had a train station less then a 5 minute walk away. Would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone :)
2018-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,James,"Excellent spot and a great space to spend a week, with easy access to downtown Sydney (and anywhere else via the train).

2018-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,26829659,Helen,"I’d really recommend this place if you’re seeing a show or sporting event at Olympic Park. It’s very handy and a just short walk from the stadium/arena, along brightly lit streets. 
Very comfortable and with two bedrooms and bathrooms would suit either families, friends or colleagues who need a place to stay."
2017-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,16651655,Ellie,"We loved staying here - great location, easy transport into city and 20 min walk to Newtown which was great. Steven was friendly while also giving us space.

Louise went out of her way to welcome us to her flat and go over local eateries, beaches and transportation for our trip. The flat was a great start to our Aussie adventures!"

2017-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Alexandra,Cathy was a lovely host and her attention to small details made the stay most enjoyable. An affordable price and not a single thing that I could think off that Cathy didn’t provide us with. Would stay there again without a doubt and would definitely recommend it to others.

2016-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,EMily,"We are just back from our two week vacation in NSW. We had the good fortune to run across Rachels gorgeous home on Air bnb. 
This place was amazing.  We were here visiting relatives and sight seeing from the USA.  Its wonderful to hear the kookaburras right in the city and all the beautiful birds. This place is like a garden oasis. Rachel was so lovely and gave us all the information we needed to make  this trip perfect. Our family of four was very comfortable and we felt very at home here. My daughter is studying music and played Rachels gorgeous piano while we were there which was an added plus.  This home is in the most perfect place. Military road is two minutes walking distance from the house and there are plenty of buses if you do not have a car. We parked on the street because we had a very large mini van and it was just easier. Plenty of parking in the surrounding streets if you need to but there is a private garage there as well for your use. 
 There are wonderful cafe's everywhere and you are very close to Raglan street which takes you down to Balmoral beach. 
I cannot say enough wonderful things about this home but my kids and husband and I were sad to leave our home away from home. Thank you so much Rachel for sharing your lovely place with us. Hopefully we will be back again. "
2017-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,888107,Maxime,Un appartement bien situé qui permet d'être dans le centre très facilement. Julie et Wyatt sont des hôtes très sympathiques. La chambre était conforme à nos attentes.

It is close to the airport and to the Mascot train station so you are in very few minutes to the city and to the airport. It gives you plenty of freedom to move. In 10 minutes you are in Circular Quay or in less than an hour in Bondi Beach."
2017-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Linda,"The apartment was so clean and tidy. Very helpful, we did get a little lost, made contact and all sorted. Overall it was a great stay, great apartment in a great location."

2013-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Yu Ming,"Gavin's place was cosy, well-kept and really clean! Conveniently located near Sydney's Central train station, with the CBD just a further 5 mins walk...Gavin was a great host too - recommending food places, places of interest and even taking time at the end of a long day at work to chat with us and share on the history of Sydney :)  Wouldn't have made much sense out of random chalk marks on the pavement otherwise..!

Would definitely recommend Gavin's to anyone, and stay there again on our next visit!"

2017-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,13852692,Liting,"房间非常漂亮,位置虽然不是CBD但是交通也算方便｡
房间对于8人来说非常宽裕｡
但是房东的各项要求非常严格,退房时间也非常早,而且在最后一天(当天是中国农历新年第一天)离开时无法寄存行李,导致我们一行人无奈只能拖着行李箱在市内玩了一天,非常疲惫｡"
2018-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,21281467,Claude,"We had a wonderful staying at Ben’s place.  It is such an awesome (Website hidden by Airbnb) two year old absolutely loves boats and imagine his excitement waking up to boats and ferries everyday!  It was such a treat for us to get into town using the ferry; we took the ferry to Barangaroo and Watson Bay for lunch and my son was over the moon.

Ben was also great organising things we needed for our baby, like a cot and baby booster seat, and provided little touches like toys, hair dryer, candles, heater in the bathroom etc.  (winter when we were there). It was also great that he stocked up! We arrived so late and were so hungry the first night we were grateful there were lots to eat in the fridge and snacks too!

The entertainment in this place is awesome, also large sofas great for entertaining if you have people over.  I love this location with options of cafes, restaurants, parks and the ferry close by.  We treated ourselves to Catalina on the last night and it was so romantic.  The only thing I wished for is a coffee machine for some good coffee.
 
We slept fine through the night, but for light sleepers the slight traffic noise is not ideal.  

All in all a great stay!"
2016-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Christine,"we felt comfy in the studio,we ,my husband was building cubby house so it was great we were able to be close to my daughter's house which was worksite,privacy was good,pubs,clubs light rail close."
2016-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Hew,"We really enjoyed our stay with Duncan and Ashlee. They're a very friendly couple and were great to chat to over the course of our stay! The room and apartment was in impeccable condition and, whilst we didn't need to use them, the pre-loaded Opal cards were a wonderful gesture! It was great to get to know both of them; absolutely great people to have the pleasure of meeting."
2017-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Tom,A lovely cottage that feels a world away from Sydney although only an hour out of town. Short walk to both the beach and cafes / shops of Bundeena and perfect for exploring the Royal National Park. We stayed during winter so were grateful for the heater and electric blankets. Would definitely recommend.
2015-08-02T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Steve,It is quite apparent as to why Susan has the title super host!Our stay was one of the most pleasurable we have ever experienced in Sydney and we look forward to staying with Susa again pending availability.
2017-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Eliza,Had a great and convenient stay at Chathy's. Super laid back and easy going. We would stay again! Thank you Cathy for your hospitality.
2017-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Shohei,"This is near of airport, and Hernan taught me how to go house from airport.
This host is very kind,I wanted to stay more."
2017-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,12370710,Jacquie,"Fantastic room. Fantastic location. Although I never got to meet Maria who was away, Jerry was a fantastic host. A not to be missed room and location. "
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,18130053,Oliver,"Stayed here over New Years and it was great. Close to public transport, shops and the airport. Also, the place feels modern and had everything we needed. Would recommend.
Cheers, Oliver"
2018-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,5581269,John,"Just completed a very enjoyable 3 week stay at Michy's cabin, while visiting family nearby. 
The cabin is opposite Michy and Paul’s home, but feels private. The property is in a beautiful location right on Pittwater, with good on road parking. The quiet reserve just across the road has lovely views along Pittwater to Lion Island. 
The cabin itself is compact, stylishly presented, very comfortable and well organised. The decking is a peaceful and shady place to relax during the heat of the day. We found we had everything we needed for an extended stay. 
Michy was a fab host throughout - always warm & friendly, respectful of privacy but quick to offer help when contacted. We enjoyed meeting her husband Paul and felt honoured when invited to the neighbours pre Christmas get together on the reserve. We had a super time with you Michy, thanks so much!
Highly recommend staying here."
2016-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Brooke,"House was exactly what we were after, perfect for a group of friends clean & great location "
2018-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,22068048,Steven,"Clean, modern, comfortable, lots to see and do in the area. It was a get away from the holidays for me and I loved the change of scenery and alone time."

There were also board games and the place was extremely clean and a fantastic place to unwind.

2017-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Matthew,"Thoughtfully set out, immaculately clean and amazingly peaceful - given that it's right on Enmore Road in what is now the epicentre of Sydney's night life. I wanted some space for reading and reflection and it was just perfect. "
2019-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Paul,"Clean, tidy 2-bed granny flat type place which you get one of the rooms of (separate keys). Super close to the airport that means walking is easy (assuming no big cases), but not under the flight path. The Train is less than 15 mins walk and has regular services straight into town.  Good cooking facilities and a nice bathroom. No AC if that matters to you, but does have a fan. Would be perfect for a city break or business meeting stay over."
2017-05-14T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Ana Maria,"I stayed in Sydney for a working weekend and I just needed a quite place for my self, I didn't wanted to share room or bathroom. This place is good for that. And I knew I wouldn't had the time to cook, so it didn't bother me to share kitchen. Susan is really helpful. The house is easy to get to/from the CBD.
Just be aware of the noise of the airplanes... 
I think is good value."
2017-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,16087198,Duy Khoa,Very very good accomodation. The Landlords were very nice. Totally worth it for this price.

2014-04-26T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Romi,"The Bundeena Garden Studio was a delight to stay in. The place was spotless and had everything we needed for our 3 day getaway.  We were able to cook some meals, as well as eat out on two occasions. The studio is a minute from beautiful beaches and from the Royal National Park walks. Belinda was very welcoming while also leaving us to do our own thing."

2016-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Paul,"We really enjoyed the our stay at Cat's in Bondi. The location was great, and the home itself was a good fit for the two families of 4 who stayed there for a couple nights."

2018-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,21851474,Adelynn,"This space is cozy and really well designed. Materials used were great so gave a really solid and homey feel to it. Amenities were great. The space was used really well so while it looked minimal when we first came in, all the stuff we needed was in the cupboards. Love this place."
2015-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Noel,"Linda left a variety of foods for us at her apartment - breakfast things, and a variety of teas. Tim tams too! The wifi worked well as did the utility room's white goods that we used. The parking space was really useful. 

We were travelling with our 9 month old son. Linda provided us with a cot for him to use (for free) which was terrific. We had some queries and Linda got back to us immediately with answers to our questions. We liked the ""manual"" she left for the Redfern area which highlighted activities we might otherwise not have done like visiting the local weekend market.

The Redfern neighbourhood is a bit of a hipsters area. There's a good (bike) coffee shop opposite and we had a ridiculously good Sunday lunch at the pub next door. The very well connected underground station is a short walk away. The area felt very safe."
2012-05-21T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Damien,"The house is in a great location only a couple of hundred metres from Tailor Square. Its walking distance from all the entertainment and dining options on Oxford Street, Victoria Road and Kings Cross.

The bedroom was nice but a little small for a male-male couple with luggage. The bathroom is nice but it's a little awkward walking up and down the stairs to get between the bedroom and the bathroom. If you're not worried about privacy this is just an inconvenience. The bathroom's location next to the living area is also a little embarrassing when you have those noisy moments."
2017-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,8121226,Melissa,"Location was good, 2 minutes walk to the train station, 2 supermarkets which were each 5 minutes away. The weekend market was so interesting and the food sold was great. The studio was well-equipped and saw to all our needs. There were many eateries around, a police station nearby. It's safe, well furnished. It's a 10-15 min ride to the city which makes it very convenient. Jenny, our host, was prompt in her responses and made sure we were comfortable throughout. "
2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,1321603,Tanya,"Ann was a gracious host and a fantastic cook. She was very good company and her place is ideally located - very near the wharf, cafe, and bowling club as well as just a short walk to the beach."

Everything was provided that we needed. The Nespresso was great when we didn't want to go out for coffee! The studio is easy walking distance to Bronte beach, pubs and restaurants. We didn't actually get to meet susan, her daughter checked us in. but communication with her via Air BnB was easy. I would definitely stay again if I go back to this area. "

2018-06-30T04:00:00.000Z,14921505,Thu,"A perfect retreat with perfect view! We were a big group and yet didn’t feel on top of each other. The outdoor hot spa with view over Pittwater was definitely a highlight. The direct access to the beach was a great bonus. Bailey was a fab host, very responsive and accommodating. Some of the cabinets and drawers could be more tidy and the bbq wasn’t cleaned properly, but we had a fab stay overall and would recommend the house to other travellers. We’ll definitely love to stay again."

There is a park near here and it is quiet area.
Cath is very friendly and a kindly person.

2019-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,30412858,Monika,If you don’t feel disturbed by very simple furniture and quiet noisy sleeping rooms you can book it. If you expect a flat on a high floor with Harbour view this is not the right place.
2018-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,20865085,Amie,"Jenny's home is in the most idealic picturesque coastline of Australia. You are also a stone's throw away from Tamarama or Bronte beach. Upon arrival, there was snacks, fruit and breakfast goodies for our stay and also celebratory champagne for our honeymoon. The furnishing was gorgeous, the aircon was amazing after a sunny day on the beach and communication was superb if we ever needed a thing. We cannot wait to return! Thank you so so much"

The location is perfect for accessing shops (literally on top of them!) and the bus stop is a 3min walk away for easy travel to the city. The apartment is as beautiful as pictures show, has washer/dryer!, parking was easy, and Diana/Jared were wonderful to work with. They were so friendly and checked in with me to make sure all was going well and to see if I needed anything. Will definitely stay here again in the future! Thank you!"
2017-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,13562321,Beau,You can't beat this location. We stayed for almost a week and walked or took a very convenient train everywhere that we cared to go. The size of the apartment was adequate and comfortable but not terribly large. It was reasonably clean and put together but not luxurious. The hosts were very kind to allow us to check in several hours early and we never actually meet anyone in person as the key was conveniently in a lock box. Overall it was consistent with the description and our expectations. I would recommend this for others particularly given the convenient location.
2017-09-18T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Lisa,"Great location, 2 minute walk to maroubra beach, local cafes and places within walking distance. The beach is beautiful and the area is not so far from the airport. Around 15-20 minute drive. The neighbourhood is quiet, and peaceful. Cleanliness of the place could have been better, with it being abit dusty and a few cockroaches here and there. Other than that, the hosts are quite friendly, easy to communicate with and easy going."
2018-06-13T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Catharine,"Really lovely space, nice and close to transport and shops. Sam was really helpful and quick to respond."
2015-08-09T04:00:00.000Z,7439246,Mia,Beautiful clean home and in an excellent spot. Host was very quick to respond and helpful. Would recommend this place.
2017-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Penny,Had a great stay! Fitted our extended family very comfortably and we loved the location and the balcony view. The inclinator made things easy for our elderly guests as the house goes over several levels. Bailey was a great communicator and Paradise Beach is a quiet place to swim and full of character!
2019-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Susie,"Lovely apartment right opposite the sea . We really enjoyed the stay , thank you ."
2017-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Brendan,Great location. Very central. Really spacious apt
2018-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Ahmad Nawaz,"Location: Absolutely fantastic, next to beach (less than one minute) Cafe's, Restaurants and Coles (10 minutes - you don't feel this walk as walking next to beach is itself a pleasure) Bus stand (one minute).  The apartment has quite peaceful surroundings. 
Room: Has everything that you would need during your stay and the entire apartment is absolutely neat and clean. Also there are cereals available for you, which is a great plus.  
Host: Glad that I met Angela, clear instructions and clear communication made the stay as one of my best."
2017-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Itay,"Michele was incredibly welcoming and kind, helping us with any request or question. The apartment has a very comfy bed and a superb bathroom, and was neat and clean when we entered. The neighborhood is very quiet, although it is only a short walking distance (about 8 minutes) from the train station, several pubs and coffee places and lots of restaurants. The only drawback is having a central air conditioning system, controlled from Michele's part of the house right next to the partition, though whenever heating was needed she quickly turned it on (responding in just a minute or two).

Overall, this is an excellent value for your money's worth, and I highly recommend it."
2018-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Celeste,"Great location, great little apartment and amazing view"
2016-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Anthea,"Beautiful location, so close to beaches and the National Park. Great little studio with everything you need."
2017-10-18T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Michael,A lovely apartment with everything you could need. The location was also great - just five minutes walk from Kings Cross Station and lots of great restaurants even closer. The Saturday morning market in the square outside was also a nice surprise.
2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Oliver,"Paul's place is as good as how he described it. The unit is in a very good location. We were able to walk around the neighbourhood as well as commute to other parts of Sydney by bus or train with ease. It was an added bonus that when we requested Paul if we could have another heater (there were 3 of us) since one was not enough for both the bedroom and living room, he readily provided. Though we were out most of the time, we appreciated the fact that Paul's unit is a very beautiful and well-appointed one. It was nice going back to the unit after a long day of going out and seeing the sights. We highly recommend this place to anyone travelling to Sydney. Lastly, although Paul was away on a trip, he was very accommodating in terms of communicating with us during our stay and it certainly made it easier for us to get settled in and get the most of our stay in Sydney."
2017-08-30T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Vera,"我们短暂停留了两天,因为回国时间较早,这里离机场很近,拎着两个大箱子走路也就30分钟,房间十分干净,是自助入住,房东人很亲切,房东妈妈也很热心地为我们指路,周围很安静,可以走路到附近的便利店和超市,入住体验非常好｡"
2016-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Shehzad,It was a very good stay at Angela's place. Angela was responsive and very kind to guide me the way to get to location. Place is at a good peaceful location yet with some very good views across the road. Overall a good stay!
2016-03-12T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Juliet,"Cath is one of those lovely people that make everything lovely. She's clearly got an eye for design because this place has been so cleverly done. 
She left me beautiful homemade jam, fresh eggs from her gorgeous chickens, a chocolate eater egg, milk, a very generous selection of cereals ... she really knows how to make you feel welcome. 
The cottage is very comfortable and it's completely private, fully equipped, comfortable bed, close to transport. There is nothing at all to fault. I really appreciate it so thanks Cath for a fantastic stay!"
2018-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,22378312,Rebecca,"Great spot - 5 mins walk to Kings Cross station, buses, 20 minute walk to City.  

Restaurants, cafes, bars all in close proximity. Lachlan the host, was obliging, friendly, helpful and checking in was easy

Was a little bit of noise from Main Street late at night (but you have to expect that in a central location) and from 7am onwards due to construction works (guess this is temporary). 

Overall enjoyed our stay and great value for money"
2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Dena,Great location and great restaurants surrounding Millie’s place!
2015-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Lea,"We had a wonderful stay with Naveen and Tristan. They were terrific hosts and made us feel very welcome - providing lots of great tips on nearby cafes and bars, and even bathrobes. The bedroom had an amazing view and was large and spotless. The apartment is in a fantastic location - close to the city and lots of great places to eat and shop - and is really comfortable and super stylish. Definitely would stay with Naveen and Tristan again!"
2016-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,12256344,Chantelle,"Paul, Judith and Tim were welcoming, friendly and completely lovely. They allowed me the space I needed yet were open to a nice chat each evening too. I highly recommend this AirBnB. It's delightful and so are the hosts. "
2018-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,David,"Michele was a great host, with clear, easy communication and lovely small touches (fresh fruit in the fridge was great!)
The place is in a perfect location, close to King Street and Newtown train station. 
Great secluded room with private entrance, exactly what we wanted! 
Thanks Michele :)"
2018-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,21999107,Kyle,"Amazing location steps away from a beautiful sandy beach.  Brightly lit living space with a large comfortable bed.  TV Chanel selection was great, I was able to watch the NFL games and they had Netflix.  Neil was great answering questions and pointed us out to some amazing restaurants within walking distance."
2017-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,10091713,Ed,"I enjoyed my stay at Ben's place. Perfect location for public transport either to city (5 mins) or Bondi or Coogee beaches.
Small but has everything you need to explore Sydney with and best of all, great city views!"

We would definitely stay again :)"
2016-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Ulrika,En fantastisk värd som välkomnade oss och hjälpte oss med väskor och introducerade lägenheten och området för oss. Lägenheten var underbar och var nog bättre än beskrivningen. En klar överraskning. Området var perfekt om du vill ta dig runt i Sidney. Nära till tåg och buss.
2017-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Marie-Amelie,Un joli appartement très bien situé si vous souhaiter sortir. Logement spacieux et  accueillant. David a été charmant et réactif tout au long de nôtre séjour. Je recommande grandement l endroit!
2018-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Robyn,"Margaret and John are absolutely sterling hosts!  

What a unique and restful experience this was!  In the midst of a peaceful Australian forest, you will find a private, refurbished railway carriage with so many true to period furnishing for you to enjoy a lovely yesteryear ambiance.

Margaret provided fresh fruit, vegetables, breakfast makings and beverages.  A very generous food offering.

I highly recommend this venue.

You will particularly enjoy the experience if you have an appreciation for historical railway memorabilia, and days gone by!"
2016-08-07T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Ashley,"It was a great place to stay, awesome location for a good price, and it was a good size for the four of us for four nights. Nice view out the window of the city too"
2018-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Zara,"Susan’s studio is bright, clean and wonderfully located in Bronte. The beach, a fab bakery, and great cafes and restaurants are all a short walk away. Susan was a wonderful host and the little touches and local knowledge made our trip extra special."

2017-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Yohay,"The place was as small as shown in the pictures, and still equipped with  everything one may need, including everything for cooking in the tiny kitchen. Cath was attentive and generous in house supplies."
2017-03-27T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Susan,It was central and perfect for our stay
2018-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Michelle,"Great value for money.   Was a great place for our family of 5 to stay for our trip.  Close to public transport to the City.  Our kids loved that there was a pool.  Sarah was very friendly,  happy to answer any questions that we had and made us feel right at home.  Would recommend to anybody looking for somewhere to stay outside of the City Centre."

Can't fault it."
2016-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Marcus,"A botiuge place to stay, a little sparse in furnishings and would be a little cold in winter, lots of concrete. 
In general a nice place to stay and very convenient to restaurants and the city of Sydney. A short walk to the bottom of the hill and you are at the waterfront looking at the Opera House, Harbour Bridge and Luna Park. "
2018-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,16651655,Scott TJ,Great location for getting about that part of town. Excellent value.

2018-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,22362742,Paul,"Eleni's place is situated in a fantastic spot in Sydney. Right amongst it. The unit is clean, chic and well decorated. A comfortable bed takes up just about all the space in the bedroom and a comfortable pullout sofa can be used  as a second bed. All in all thoroughly recommended. Cheers Paul"
2018-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Stuart,This place exceeded our expectation and we are so happy we chose this place to stay. Everything was easy to use and we were amazed at the great features in your home. Thank you so much!
2019-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,15889399,Madeline,"A beautiful studio to stay in, the place was super clean and had everything we needed. Steven was quick to respond to messages and the checkin process was very easy. Would absolutely stay here again!"
2013-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Hilke,"Natasa was a friendly and communicative host. She was always very busy but took her time to provide us with useful information about places to go, things to see and how to get there. We had chosen her place to organize the further months of our stay in Sydney and booked the accommodation before our arrival in Australia. The house is located in a side road to Petersham rail station - a perfect location to get into the heard of Sydney quick and easy. The room, bathroom and kitchen were equipped with everything you need. We enjoyed stayting at Natasas home!"
2015-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,2711936,Avi,"Karen is a wonderful host.
I really enjoyed her place and her company. Her place is clean comfortable and close to all (2 min walk to the beach)
Karen guided me through all my stay and thanks to her my 4 days visit was a filled up with the right activities.
Thanks you karen for being such a great host I hope one day to come back."
2017-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Nicky,"Great centrally located apartment. I loved the balcony - it's a real suntrap and a lovely place for an afternoon drink. The bed was comfortable and it's great there are two bathrooms - one on the living/dining level and another off the bedroom. 

It's opposite central station, so it's really easy to get everywhere via train. 

Just note there is some construction going on - firstly on the road outside (it's literally all ripped up) so you need to catch a Uber from the road around the corner. Secondly the building is under maintenance (roof terraces being are renovated) - but it didn't concern me at all. 

Wifi was good and quick. 

Overall I'd happily stay there again and really enjoyed my stay."
2015-06-21T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Frederick,"We had a wonderful month at the Idyllic Sanctuary on moving to Sydney. Stayed there with my wife and two young children who had a great time.

Accommodation was as advertised and host was easily contactable and very accommodating. Location is extremely convenient for everything from shops to public transport to parks.

The third room provides options for an extra person but it is significantly smaller than the two main rooms which are very spacious and have built in cupboards."

"
2016-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Terry,"Paul's place is right in the heart of the action in Potts Point, just down the road from King's Cross. It's a great central location for exploring inner Sydney. Communication was great and checkin was easy. While it's technically one bedroom, our four year old was very happy on a mattress in the study nook which has its own door and effectively becomes a small second bedroom."
2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,10213499,John,Great space and location. Great value. I will definitely stay again.
2017-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Allen,"Fantastic host.  Very prompt responses and highly attentive to the incoming heatwave --- Linda went out of her way to get a misting fan to help our little one adjust to the hotter climate 

Would definitely stay again of back in Sydney"
2016-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Xiaolu,"David was kind enough to greet us in person and to show us around. The apartment was superb. It's BIG! The beds and sofa are super comfy and the large windows gives a perfect natural lighting to the whole room (LOVE IT!). The location was perfect, too. Kings cross station is just around the corner, tons of restaurants and cafes on the Macleay st as well.

I'd definitely recommend David's place to all my friends who's going to visit Sydney."

2015-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,1145567,Yan,"It is lovely neighborhood, very easy access to all the buses to the city center. The host adam has been helpful and was generous to let me use his living room for my work. The first night the room floor was dusty but was happy it was thoroughly cleaned on the second day. The only concern I had was the room has no lock, given I was the only female guest in the house and did not know any of other (male) guests on the first day of arrival, I was slightly nervous in the first night until I met other guests who were very kind and friendly. "
2015-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Felicity Jane,"We had an awesome stay at Naveen and Tristians. It was really easy to get to, excellent access to public transport, all the city sights and places we wanted to go. There is a wealth of good cafe and bars in the area and we were given excellent tips on which ones to go to. Friendly, clean, welcoming great amenities and views! lots of personal space or good chats."
2013-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Hasan,"We have enjoyed our stay at Louise's flat. It is modern and spacious, and full of sun light. All the appliances are new and working excellently. The little herb garden was useful in cooking with fresh herbs. Louise is very considerate and friendly. I would very much recommend the flat for a comfortable unforgotten stay."
2017-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Jim,"The two upstairs bedrooms are large and well lit. Very comfortable. The third bedroom is more of a maid's quarters (with attached laundry room). If you plan to have a relative stay in that room, prepare for some feedback.

My only real issue with the home is the vehicle traffic. Do not understand how a narrow suburban road that is only 3 blocks long can support so much traffic starting at 6am, continuing to 10pm. Plus one day there were some early major deliveries to the facility across the street. [Not sure why this did not appear in other reviews. After my visit I rechecked the reviews. Traffic mentioned on page 3. Deeper than I usually look.]  Don't plan to sleep in.

Perhaps this was the price to pay for convenience to Mosman village. Walked there for breakfast, lunch, dinner, shopping, wandering. Very convenient. Very friendly."

The kitchen was fully stocked with spices, tea flavours and an Nespresso machine. The bathroom had lovely toiletries and supplies.

Overall I had a lovely stay. Simon and Nicole were very accommodating hosts. The area is in a great location with easy access to public transport.

2018-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,13852692,Kath,A most stylish house to spend the few days prior to our daughters wedding.  Great for photos.  Feel like we were living in a classy antique warehouse with all the mod cons that were needed!  Great location too.
2017-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Nicolle,"Very cute, but small place.  Paul was very quick to respond when i had a question.  Keep in mind that you must climb 2 sets of stairs to get to the apartment and the shower was very tiny.  It was still comfortable and i loved the bakery downstairs."

2017-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Willie,"Sabrina's place was quite clean, spacious, and well-equipped. We had a nice stay there!"
2017-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Rob,"Great location, 2 minutes from cafe's and the waterfront. Ideal for larger groups and families. The house was clean and tidy. Marcella is quick to respond to enquiries and made the check in process easy. I would recommend staying here. "
2018-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,23650892,Rebekah,"Great location!  Close to transit, restaurants, pubs, shops, everything you need.  The apartment is spacious and beautifully decorated creating a very comfortable atmosphere.  Host responded to our needs very quickly.  The concierge staff at the front door were all very friendly and welcoming."
2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,24863216,Rebecca,A fabulous small and compact studio in a great location for the eastern superb beach life
2016-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Joeltron,"Stayed for my second time with Naveen, this time shorter but just as lovely as the first!

We first visited her for the location and keep going back for the amazing vibe and also Felix. Looking forward to future visits too!"
2018-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,23529310,Andrew,Casey was a lovely host!   The room is comfortable and very convenient to Sydney University and surrounds.   I had a problem-free stay :)
2015-12-12T05:00:00.000Z,1310308,Kim,Lovely apartment beautifully kept and modestly decorated.  Location of mosman very pretty with all amenities close by.  Lovely ferry ride to get to Sydney main area - would certainly return to this address if in mosman again.
2017-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Fathima,Perfect location and very cosy place.
2018-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,16166535,Philip,"I stayed here for a second time, collectively in the last month I have spent about 5 hours looking over accommodation in Sydney (which I know pretty well) and Fei's place is definitely the nicest and most competitively prices. I would highly recommend."
2019-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,20767798,Thomas,"The location is great as you can easily get to many points of interest. We were unlucky as there was a lot of construction work directly around the building the whole day and night during our stay. Jared gave us finally a refund for this, so we are okay with that. The apartment has not so much light as the pictures indicate but this is not a blocking point for visiting Sydney. Check In worked easily."
2018-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Titi,Angela is very nice host. She could give us lots of information about the beautiful local place around her guest house.
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Louise,"This is such a great querky cottage to stay in.  Lovely location, comfortable and has eveyrthing you need for a city stay.  Many thanks Bryan!"
2016-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Angela,"Our host Linda made us very welcome, provided more items  e.g. food/washing powder, umbrellas which we needed.  Other items beyond our expectations.  The apartment was exactly as shown on the website. Very clean, comfortable bed, bathroom perfect. She provided us with information with regard transport, local shopping and places to eat.  The off street parking was very accessible and secure. The instructions were well set out.  We liked the area. She was very interested to make sure we were comfortable. We would strongly  recommended to couples like us. 
"
2017-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Ferdei,very nice place. clean and well kept. access to public transport is not an issue. hernan gave very clear instruction and provided assistance in whatever the guest needs. i highly recommend his place if you want to travel to sydney.
2017-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Hengyue,"The apartment is located in the heart of Sydney and importantly near to many attractions. 
We find that the apartment is suitable for a group of 6, and with sufficient necessities provided by the host. 
The process for check-in and check-out is easy with the detailed instructions provided by the host."
2017-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,琬琪,"陽台好舒適,環境也很整潔,房東家的兩隻狗狗也超溫馴好可愛"
2017-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Francesca,"Our stay at Leslie's place was great and all we needed.
The room has all the necessities we needed and all was as described.
We ended up being on the go most of the time and for that it was a perfect place for us to stay: close to the bus stop and the ferry station in manly as well.
Would stay again!"
2017-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Laura,"Highly recommend this beautiful place. We booked for a girls' weekend, and we were really happy. The place is very clean, and just perfect for a relaxing holiday near the beach. Cat is a wonderful host and easy to deal with. Plenty to see and do, great access to public transport, and the shower is amazing! Would definitely stay there again. :-)"
2018-06-08T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Heather,A lovely apartment - modern with convenient location and wonderful views. Definitely recommended.
2016-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,13562321,Mónica,"El apartamento es amplio y está muy bien ubicado ya que está en el centro, además tiene una parada de tren a 3 minutos caminando. "
2019-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Maria,The house was beautiful. Very clean with lots of fresh bed linen and towels. The kitchen facilities were excellent and the house had lots of cooking essentials that I would not have expected. I would highly recommend a stay at this property
2017-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Anna & Michael,We very much enjoyed staying in Millie's lovely and very well presented apartment. It's very easy to get to from the airport/city and in a part of town that's a delight to wander (if you can tear yourself away from the balcony with its view of the Harbour Bridge).
2016-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,9735397,David,"Great location, nice folks, more than adequate lodging.  Sean & Nadia very helpful."
2017-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Katalina,"Mohit has a nice place. It was big enough to host the 7 of us. There were 4 adults and 3 children. We stayed for 4 nights and we did enjoy our stay. The place is very secured but I found having one key was problematic when you have 7 people stay in the apartment. Also, there is only one undercover parking spot and finding a parking around the area was very hard. There was also no iron in the apartment. Apart from that, the place is clean, is in a very good location, close to everything and close to the airport. It was what I expected!"
2015-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Shawn,"This is a very good location to the beach and near to CBD. The property is comfortable however it's quite dusty on the second floor and there's a lot of mosquitoes around the house. Some of us got bitten quite badly but owner did provide insect repellent. Bad luck for us on power failure on the 2nd day but owner got it fixed so no complaint on that, although update can be more prompt to remove the anxiety we faced when approaching the night time with the problem still outstanding."
2017-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Liz,"Totally unsuitable for older people, dingy, messy garden, description does not say there were 5 people sharing one bathroom - the other shower is downstairs and reached by going outside! There is a cat not mentioned in description. Natasha gave someone our beer which she replaced. it may be cheap to Sydney and convenient for the station but it was very disappointing. Had it not been convenient for our family nearby we would have left on day one. towels not changed on a 10 day visit and we had to request bedding change. It was very hot despite a fan in the room. security is poor with only one locked gate protecting us and no locks on bedroom doors. Not recommended even for backpackers."
2017-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,12370710,Terry,It is one of the most beautiful parts of Australia. Not for sleeping in. Get out and enjoy the day.
2017-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,16811226,Cedric,Very good folks. Smooth & responsive communication. They made accommodations for me to check-in the early morning given my 7am-hour flight arrival. They had a welcome package waiting for me. Great location in Bondi -- 'not even a 5 minute walk to the beach. Even offered to provide information on local activities that I might be interested in. Great experience.
2017-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Jean,"The position and access to shops and restaurants was a little stroll from Susan's place, but was perfect because once eaten you could walk off the meal on your way back to Susan's"

2018-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Hope,"David’s unit was in a great location and just looking out the windows at life on the streets was a great pastime. The unit was perfect for our purpose as a base for our sightseeing trip to Sydney. Checkin went smoothly, the unit was clean and provided everything that we needed to make our stay relaxed and comfortable"
2017-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Jane,"This is a lovely little apartment in a good location - plenty of restaurants &   Cafes & within easy reach of the clean & efficient train network.  Well equipped, comfortable beds &. Strong  wifi.  "
2017-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Sophia,"The location of this apartment is prime! Easy walking distance to all the inner city attractions and as this apartment shares the building with a hotel, you feel safe coming and going as you please. 

There are currently major roadworks going on on George street (the street the apartment overlooks) which is really loud at night time as they work throughout the night. If you're sensitive to sound while sleeping, ask the host if they're still working or bring a good set of ear plugs ;) "
2014-04-25T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Kaila,"Hernan's place was clean and comfortable. It's close to the airport which was perfect for our last night in Australia. He is very quick to respond and help with any questions you may have - including my many inquiries about how to take the local pic lib transit. 

Thank you!"
2017-04-20T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,Prina,"This apartment is stunning, well equipped, - stones throw away from the beach, shops and restaurants. Anita is a great host and will accommodate where possible and makes you feel very welcome. It was perfect for our stay in Manly and felt like home from home. Would definitely recommend a stay there if you are looking for a place close to the beach with everything you could wish for when on holiday! "
2017-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Franck,Perfect host! Lovely neighborhood

2016-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,6046461,Johnny,Suzie was an amazing host. The listing accurately describes the property. Suzie was extremely organised and made the check-in and arrival process a breeze. Highly recommended!
2016-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,14223095,Majella,"Krythia's apartment was clean, quiet and comfortable and close to beautiful Balmoral.  Krythia was very understanding about our late arrival into Sydney and ensured we could access the property in her absence.  Krythia ensured we had everything we needed to make ourselves comfortable for our brief stay (tea, coffee) and was a generous host."
2018-06-30T04:00:00.000Z,24863216,Lucy,Vivian’s place was lovely and cosy! Only a short walk down to Bronte beach!  She was a great host with quick responses and very helpful.
2016-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Yvonne,Hosts could not have been more welcoming from the goodies to the lovely bottle of champagne which was a lovely surprise after such a long journey they were also most accommodating with the key pick up location could not have been more perfect we all loved it the perfect hosts and perfect location hopefully we will make it back sometime
2017-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,Michaella,All 4 of us had a wonderful time! Hilde also gave us bread and muesli for our stay. Very close to the beach and the shops! Kitchen was very well stocked. The outdoor dining area was a nice treat to watch the sunset over the water.
2019-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,17438054,Jay,Very neat and tidy granny flat. Will definitely be using again.

2017-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Gillian,"Susan's studio is in a good location for transport links to the city. The studio is clean and comfortable with facilities to have drinks and heat snacks. Susan is helpful and accommodating.

We did have issues with the busy flight path on certain mornings. Make sure you get an opal card before you use any local transport and watch out for expensive taxis from the airport."
2016-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Hao,Linda is very responsive and considerate. Easy access to CBD and Sydney university. We really enjoyed the stay at her place

2016-05-03T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Elisa,"My family of 5 had a wonderful time in Sydney.  Gavin's apartment was bright, spacious and had all of the amenities that we needed in a central Sydney location.  Gavin was responsive and accommodating to a couple queries that we had.  We would recommend this apartment to family and friends.   "
2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,David,"I can highly recommend this property. Great location. Very clean. The host Mona was awesome, very helpful and great communication. Thank you"
2018-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,21583732,Kate,"Ellie's place is perfectly described - well appointed bedroom and bathroom (which is shared but didn't feel like it - really I had it all to myself for my brief stay!). Her home is very close to transport yet very leafy and quiet.  Ellie was flexible with my arrival time, and helpful with parking, making a cup of tea, explaining wi fi etc. Enjoyed my stay - highly recommend."
2014-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Jothi,"Linda was a great host.  Although we couldn't meet her, she did everything that we asked for and made sure we were comfortable.  The listing was accurate and the neighbouhood was quiet and calm even though the place was very close to the city.

She also provided us with milk, bread, yoghurt and cereal for breakfast.

I would recommend staying here to anyone who is going to Sydney.


"
2016-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Nic,"The place was amazing. Located on the top floor of an apartment complex in Surry Hills it was central yet quiet. Train station a five minute walk will get you anywhere and some nice local pubs and places to eat close by also. 
The space itself it awesome. Has everything you need and the cable TV caused us to stay inside a little more than we probably should have. 
Pool and gym located in the building as well as a roof top tennis court none of which seem to get overly busy which is good.

Nicole and Simon were a pleasure to deal with and flexible with us as guests. Would recommend to anyone and would return when next in Sydney.

Thanks again Nicole and Simon."
2014-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,2900140,Gray,Great place to stay. I wish I had planned to stay longer..

2018-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,18616850,Deborah,Quaint and pretty cottage in a wonderfully quiet location . Very close to the wonderful shops and amenities of the Paddington. A lovely home for a romantic weekend get away . Great host in every way.

2017-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Matt,"I had a wonderful stay at David's home. What an incredible location literally on the doorstep of Flinders St and Oxford St (including many of the most well-known gay bars/clubs), and yet so quiet. From there you can also pretty much get yourself anywhere in Sydney really easily and quickly. The property is exactly as described, and if anything, had a few pleasant surprises in terms of the various things he provided. Oh, and the bed is super comfy. I didn't have much opportunity to interact with David (as I was mainly seeing friends and attending a wedding), but he provided everything I needed and was really nice and flexible. I would very happily stay with David again the next time I'm in Sydney."
2016-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,Mark,"Kath is a very accommodating and friendly host. I arrived late on the day and she waited patiently for me to check in. She lives at a super convenient location - 10 minutes train ride to city, apple store, China town etc. Would definitely stay again next time I'm in Sydney!! "
2018-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Linda,Perfect base for exploring the city and very well equipped.
2017-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Louise,"Brilliant location and house is spacious and very well thought out. Bailey is always around to help out if you have any questions.

thank you again."
2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,15889399,Kristy,"Steven and Peta’s AirBnB is a gorgeous example of inner city life in Sydney. The area is full of great restaurants and cafes, shady tree-lined streets, and friendly locals. The cabin itself is a cosy, immaculately clean, comfortable and thoughtfully appointed. We also had the pleasure of meeting Steven. A truly great stay - would recommend without hesitation."
2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,22346270,Kailyn,Perfectly understand why Sam is a super host. Sam's place is by far the best place I have ever stayed in terms of bnb. The place is well managed. Everything is very clean and well designed. Had a really pleasant stay there. Highly recommended!!!!
2017-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Sonali,"We were only at Cathy's place for one night but it was really lovely - spotlessly clean, comfy with a great selection of tea/coffee. Cathy was kind enough to pick us up from the bus stop, and was very helpful throughout our stay."
2017-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Amanda,"Great place, ideal location for exploring Sydney. Excellent saturday market and local coffee shop. Plenty of choice for restaurants and cafes. We were lucky enough to be in Sydney for Vivid festival which was amazing. The building corridors etc could do with a spruce up and the apartment wasn't as clean as it could be but nothing major. One slight gripe was we were hoping that the spare bed would be a single blow up not a double as it would have fitted in the little dressing room and given that guest a bit of privacy and we did have to move some furniture to place the air bed in an area where we wouldn't trip over it when getting up in the night. Overall really pleased with our choice, thank you Paul. Communication and check in was very smooth "
2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,17944310,Sivateja,"Nice and clean family home, has all amenities that we needed. Had no issues whatsoever. Warm and kind hosts Maryam and Ali. Will definitely stay again if need be."
2017-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,12655535,Gabi,"This is a lovely place to stay. It's a very quick walk to darling harbour, either walk up the hill and across, or through the parking structure down the road and cross at the tram crossing and it takes about two or three minutes!
It was very comfortable, two full bathrooms, a full kitchen two bedrooms, could comfortably fit four people. Great area, close to grocery stores, restaurants, pubs, public transport!"
2016-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Hannah,I felt very at home here. Arnie and Lorraine are warm and relaxed. The bed was super comfortable and it was quiet at night. The location was perfect- my favourite part of Sydney. Loved being surrounded by all the art.
2016-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Rosana,"Wonderful host! Natasa was warm and welcoming and kindly organised Uber transport to get us to a show on time within half an hour of arrival!! Perfect location for inner city venues. The room was excellent- clean, comfortable and with lovely homely touches. Highly recommended stay. We will be back when back in Sydney."
2015-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Tim,"My wife and I loved this apartment. Very clean, with a lovely homely feel. Lots of little extras similar to a 5 star hotel. Quiet neighbourhood with great views. Would stay again."
2015-03-13T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Camille,"We had an amazing time in this lovely studio!
2 min walk from the beach, 
the studio got a lot of charm with white ceiling an lots of light and peaceful garden around it.

I will be back!"
2018-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,24858356,Susannah,"I loved staying at this adorable apartment. 
The location is amazing, literally metres to the beach and handy to everything. The apartment is modern, clean and very well equipped, I had everything I needed for a perfect getaway in Bondi.
The bed was super comfortable and the kitchen and bathroom are immaculate.
But the best part was waking up, walking outside and having gorgeous Bondi Beach at my doorstep.
Heavenly! Thank you Natasha, I will be back."
2016-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Sco,"A great place to stay. Close to everything in Olympic Park (including being around the corner from the train station), and a phenomenal view. From the lounge room as well as both bedrooms and balcony you can clearly see every major sporting venue. And what's better is it's only roughly a 10 min walk to any one of them, making it incredibly easy to access any one of them with ease. 

The apartment itself was very clean, with a modern look and feel, and had everything we needed. And whilst we didn't actually meet Nicole, her communication was excellent and she was very accommodating when we had a couple of extra guests show up at late notice wanting to stay, and she allowed us to have a late checkout.

All of this for a great price.

Thanks Nicole. I would definitely stay there again."
2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,26474245,Andrew,"Leigh's place was perfect for our family of 5.  A 2 min walk to the beach, 30 seconds to cafe's and 2 mins to the Supermarket.   Buses to take us into the city were available at the end of the street.  The place was spotless, comfortable and had everything we needed.  The kids loved the Netflix and playing trivia on the (Hidden by Airbnb) smart speaker.   A highly recommended place to stay."
2018-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Adriano,"The apartment location and amenities are great, the host is quick to reply and help, the car park, main entry doors and lifts can be abit confusing but once your in, you will be in the best spot and apartment for all the attractions nearby."
2017-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,21583253,Jordan,Nice cosy apartment style home close to ships and transport
2018-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,24608152,Alex,"A beautiful and relaxed place to stay. Very comfortable and Godelieve is a very welcoming, generous and kind host. The view from the balcony is beautiful & although the pool is shared & Godelieve lives upstairs it feels very private. Godelieve was very kind lending us toys for our 3 young boys and trying to get us a wooden cot for our ongoing stay in Sydney to take with us. Would recommend as a great and relaxing  place to stay and explore the northern beaches."
2016-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Gert,"Gute Beschreibung wie man zur Unterkunft kommt; ich habe alles so vorgefunden wie in der email beschrieben;
ich kann diese Unterkunft nur sehr emofehlen!"
2013-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Junshien,"Gavin's a very nice host,he'll basically try his best to answer your questions happily and talks with you easily. He allows his guest to fully utilize his accommodation which we appreciate very much. He made an effort to stock up his kitchen with full of foods upon our arrival. 

The location is amazing with free shuttle bus and central station (train) around the corner. His place is clean,tidy and big enough to accommodate quite a number of people in fact. 

The setback is there's no air conditioned which was what he'd mentioned. It gets quiet at night that we felt insecure while on the way back but so far,it's fine for us.

Overall, it's a good stay for us!"
2017-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Nancy,"Hugo and Pamela went out of their way to help us. Hugo went to the apartment to meet us so we could park our car and unload our luggage before returning the rental car to the airport so we didn't have to drag it through the city. They also let us stay on the day of check out in the apartment longer since we had a late flight. 
The view of the city is beautiful and the apartment is located close to all transportation. It is very basic, clean apartment conveniently located. They even provided milk and a bottle of water in the refrigerator to get you started. Nice flat screen TV in family room with excellent sound system. "
2015-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Peter,"A perfect home in an ideal location, very convenient to UNSW where we were attending a conference. House was exactly as described, and had been well maintained and cleaned. The bedrooms are large and beds comfy. Courtyard is perfect for a relaxed BBQ, with outdoor couches and fresh herbs. We will definitely stay here again when next in town."
2016-07-29T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Maddie,"Our stay in Jared's apartment was exactly what we needed. It's a very comfortable space for two people. There is a big window that provides a nice view of the surroundings and a lovely breeze. We didn't use the rooftop pool (too cold) but it was gorgeous! The kitchen is very small but it's well set out so there is still plenty of bench space. Being on a high floor the hot water doesn't run for particularly long but it's fine if you leave a bit of time between showers. Checking in and out was super easy! The building is in a wonderful location, we walked easily to Haymarket, Darling Harbour, the Rocks, and Circular Quay. TIP: If you are driving into the city, this is not the place to stay. Parking was a nightmare. Jared does warn that parking is expensive (he mentions $69 in the apartment description) but what I didn't realise is it's not just a $69 flat rate for more than three hours, it's $69 the first day, $50 overnight, then $69 for the next day. In the end we just gave up trying to find cheaper parking and paid. Other than that our stay was wonderful. Thank you Jared for being a wonderful host! "
2019-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,22020910,Jeong,"When you wake up in the morning, you can see beautiful sunrise. Very nice ocean view in cozy house."

2018-08-02T04:00:00.000Z,24660064,Shaan,"This apartment was everything that I needed, nice and quiet and close to public transport (a short walk to Milson's Point or Ferry). Stephen was awesome and communication was quick and efficient, great value for money as well."
2018-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,24848349,Lin,"Carol and Ian were lovely hosts who went to great trouble to ensure I had a good stay, including a local area guide,  a heater and bathroom toiletries. "

2013-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Param,"My second stay was as good as the first. Just overnight, but I arrived earlier and was able to catch up with a bit of TV news and then do internet and chat with some good music background."
2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Jack,"Oriel’s place is just as expected, and had everything you could need for a night away!"
2018-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,Narelle,"I loved our stay at Hilde's place.  Ocean views, and bush meets the sea.  The kids loved the pool and would have been perfectly happy staying put the whole time just to swim."

2015-08-16T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Joel,"Mals place was amazing and Mal is an awesome host, very welcoming and willing to help. The apartment is in a ridiculous location and it is actually more impressive than the photos. If your going to stay in Bondi, always check if Mals is available, you will love it."
2017-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,16166535,Cordelia,"We had a lovely time here. It was a large room. Breakfast was lovely. Fantastic location, short walk from restaurants and cafes. Great hosts!"
2018-07-12T04:00:00.000Z,16651655,Grace,"Terrific stay at Stevens, good location to the main street in Newtown and lovely self contained place for a stop over in Sydney! "
2017-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,21851474,Justine,"This place was perfect for me while I was traveling solo in Sydney. It's close to buses, a bit of a walk to train stations, and close to a supermarket and lots of cafes.

It can be a little loud in the area - mainly birds and dogs which I'm not used to - and you can hear the garage door opening when the car is driven in and out, but it didn't bother me at all. 

Perfect little place for one person."
2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,4502957,Katie,"This was a great place. Very big by Sydney standards and amazing location. We really enjoyed the short walk to Bondi Beach every day.

A few maintenance issues here and there from previous tenants however Hannah was very responsive and helpful when these were raised."
2019-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,22068048,Phoenix,"Very good experience staying at Lucy’s spacious apartment. There space is clean and tidy with all the necessities we need for a comfortable 16 nights stay. And Lucy and her husband are very nice and considerate, they went extra miles to make us feel at home and comfortable. I recommend her place for future airbnbers."
2017-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,20906942,Phoebe,A clean and very spacious apartment with tons of storage. The Bosch washer / dryer is a great addition although an iron would also be useful for business travelers like myself. Xinhui is friendly and accommodating. Check in is super easy with keys in a combination locked box and the apartment is quiet but well located for the city.
2018-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Alicia,Was great to come back to after a busy day! Thoughtful touches and great amenities.

2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Wayne,"The accommodation was comfortable and clean, with all essentials provided ... and very conveniently located near the airport, where I needed to be early next day.
Communication was via AirBnB / SMS ... but Shuang was always available to contact and always responded promptly.   Self check-in and check-out instructions were very clear and very easy to follow.
Highly recommended - especially if you are travelling to or from Sydney Airport."
2017-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Jeh,"Exactly as described. The apartment is spacious, bright with great views and with all amenities. There is a supermarket very close to the apartment and also restaurants and cafes. Will definitely stay here again whenever I'm back in Sydney."
2018-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Sophia,"Richard's place is exceptionally beautiful. It's chic and in a truly excellent location. Perfect for a little getaway. Richard was lovely to deal with, generous with his home and the home was thoughtfully stocked with everything you might require. We had an excellent little holiday."

Thanks very much!!"
2017-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Gis,"Great place to spend your vacations at Sydney!... even though is not close to the city center it has an excellent location, the bus stop is right outside the apartment and you can easily go to the downtown using the public transportation (very efficient by the way). You can enjoy amazing views of Bondi Beach which is just a block away and do some surfing while you are there... I highly recommend Anita and this beautiful and cozy apartment for your next holiday at Sydney :)"

Access clear amd simple,  Spacious bedroom, modern bathroom with AWESOME shower.  Kitchenette well equipped for simple needs.  Wifi excellent.   The bedroom door could be locked.  Great communication.  No traffic or aircraft noise - located in cul-de-sac.  Separate entrance to main house.  Have booked to return  for our next early flight.  Simple and great value"
2018-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,16898275,Edilson,"It is nice place for a family with 4, near by the markets,  public transportation and easy to move.

2017-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Shanee,A great location for a quick stop over in Sydney before an international flight. An easy check in and check out that accommodated my super early morning check out time. And a great shower. Thanks!
2018-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Ahmed,"Sarah was an amazing welcoming, supportive, understanding and culturally sensitive host. The place is exactly as described.

In spite of being quite far from the CBD, all the buses and expresses were less than 9 mns walking time. We could go everywhere in Sydney relying on the nearby public transportation network. We even didn’t need to hire a car as planned; due to the availability of all buses lines near Sarah’s place.

Sarah was reachable all the time, gave us a lot of tips about different things. My wife and I liked talking with her. She payed attention to the special things we needed as Muslims (We were surprised, she already aware of our religious needs!)"
2018-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Sydney,Very clean and modern. Bed very comfortable. Free parking on street. Only took 20 min to get to opera house by train. Lots of restaurants and grocery store within walking distance. Only negative was that you are able to hear the planes taking off in the early am
2018-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Mimi,Great location! Host was easy to contact. We had trouble using the stove but host arranged for immediate repairs.
2017-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,Angela,Hildes place is great we had everything we needed. She has it set up perfectly.  Very friendly host I feel she went beyond our expectations.  I would certainly recommend her place and we would love to go back. Thank you Hilde

2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Daisy,What a great find! We loved our stay here. Angela's place is exactly as it looks in the photos! Self check-in was a breeze and communication with Angela was excellent. The location was perfect and easy to find. Angela went above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable and the information pamphlet she sent was very thorough. The apartment is also close to Avalon beach and the supermarkets/shopping strip which was very convenient. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a beach getaway :)
2018-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,8121226,Rachel,"Jenny was very nice and sweet, we felt welcomed once we arrived. When me and my boyfriend lost our wallets at Bondi Beach, we were offered to help with money and were also allowed to rearrange with the check out time. The apartment is perfect for couple, compact but has everything you need and is well decorated. Lots of good cafes around the area, Kings Cross station is only 5 mins away. Good experience :)"
2016-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Zachary,An amazing time sums it all up! David's place is way better than the pictures! It is convenient and close to the trains and is really pretty! Theres weekend markets just outside!
2017-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,15960997,Jodi,Terry's house is very nice. The best part is the kitchen. It's very tidy and full of different cooking tools and spices. And there were a teddy bear sitting on our bed to welcome us. It's really surprise us. We have a really nice time here.Thanks Terry.
2017-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Pene,I always stay with Ali when in Bella Vista. Beautiful clean accommodation. Always a pleasure

He loved staying with Susan and  is very keen to come back to Bronte....organic chocolate, beers, fresh bagels....comfy bed, fab location, warm and helpful host, what more could you want?
erica "
2013-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Annalise,"The apartment exceeded expectations.  
First, the location was incredible.  Literally overlooking the Tamarama beach and a beautifull balcany to sit on and watch the world go by.  
Secondly, the apartment itself was perfect.  It is clean, with great entertaining spaces and very welcoming.  You don't feel like your invading another persons home but it still feels homely - if that makes sense!  The beds, couch and linen were all clean, fresh and comfortable.
Third, it's only a 10 min walk to Bondi!
Finally, Wayne is lovely and immediately responded to all my questions.  We only booked the apartment a few days before, and it was my first time dealing with airbnb, so we really appreciated the quick responses.  Also, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolates on arrival which was a lovely surprise!
I would highly recommend this apartment.  It is the perfect place for people who want to hang out, relax and and enjoy one of Sydney's premier beach locations.  
I will definitely go back if I need a place in Sydney. "
2019-01-24T05:00:00.000Z,26829659,Nikki,Great location for Olympic Park events
2018-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,15312988,Ali,"Great apartment - lovely and airy. Cindy and Claudio are calm and peaceful, and the decor reflects their personalities. The bedroom faces a main road, but it is surprisingly quiet at night and didn't bother me. The location is great - you can walk to Coogee beach, the racecourse, the university; and the restaurants/supermarkets are very close. Randwick is a really cool suburb for travellers in Sydney to visit, so I'd definitely recommend a few nights in this BnB."
2015-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,6293102,Jess,"This was a great house in a very cool area. It is in a super convenient location - trains and buses, grocery stores, cafes and restaurants all within 2 minutes walk from the house. The house is new and tidy, and full of plants and colour - it was a really nice atmosphere. The host was very helpful and made sure I had everything I needed, she even left me a little gift! The housemates were also really nice, they were friendly but did their own thing mainly, and that was fine with me. Overall an excellent airbnb experience. I would totally recommend it. 
"
2018-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,20962081,Martin,"Great place to stay - close to the heart of Sydney.  We didn't get to meet Min, but the place was clean, well organised and was everything we needed.  Should point out that the entry system is a fully electronic from the front door, through the elevator to the apartment door  - no need to walk past an inquisitive receptionist, etc."
2017-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,16964637,Jessica,Judy was great to communicate with and easy to reach via email and messages!  Took care of issues quickly when we accidentally locked our keys in our room.
2017-12-23T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Tony,"Location and apartment are fantastic. Everything was clean, tidy and ready for us. Paul is a great host. Would highly recommend staying here if in the Manly area."
2017-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Friederike,"Wir haben uns bei Ashlee und Duncan sehr wohl gefühlt. Das AirBnB hat eine gute Lage und war stets sauber.  Die beiden sind tolle Gastgeber, die uns unsere Zeit in Sydney durch Tipps und spontane Aktivitäten unvergesslich gemacht haben. Hoffentlich sehen wir uns irgendwann mal wieder! :)"

2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,16221015,Sharon,"Omio is really a lovely host that made us feel welcome from the first day on. He had so many recommendations for the neighbourhood and was also in for some activities to do together! His home is very clean, and the rooftop view is just amazing. I couldn't wish for more than this AirBnB stay, thank you so much Omio for your hospitality and kindness."
2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,10423504,Lucy,"Cat was great! The place was welcoming and homey. We felt right at home. Definitely recommend. This was perfect for my family of four. We were able to cuddle up in the comfy couch after a day on the beach. 

We are especially grateful for our experience here because we had to cancel our previous place at the rocks.  The host there was unaffected with our concerns. All of which were half heartedly addressed, if at all.  The house at the rocks where we stayed had a terrible mold problem. My poor son was having asthma attacks. 

Luckily, Cat was able to accommodate last minute and she was sure to deal with any concerns we had right away. But we didn’t have any. Everything was great, you won’t be disappointed."
2015-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Ilona,Neighbourhood was peaceful and we really enjoyed our time in there.

The apartment is very conveniently located and the bed really comfortable.  I walked to most places and took the bus or train at other times.  This was my first visit in Sydney and it was a blast.  Thank you, guys."

Good accommadation but not luxury.
A hole in ceiling that needed to be fixed with a bowl to catch the drips in the sunroom area and no wifi for our stay which was disappointing.
Great cafes, bars, outdoor entertainment.

Good kids room downstairs.  A selection of toys too.  No problems with communication etc.

Currently no curtains on the windows in the main bedroom which meant we didn't sleep well, hopefully the owner will remedy this."

The location was great too, as right near the ocean, start of a great walk through the national park and not far to the shops. We would highly recommend staying here if you love walking and would like a great place to relax after."
2017-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,9701620,Clare,Lovely quirky cottage in handy position to reach Darling Harbour and nearby Glebe. Comfy beds. Nice gesture of welcome pack on arrival. Only criticism is extractor fan broken in bathroom which caused humidity and difficult to keep clean. The host is very helpful and keeen to share local knowledge and wants to help you have a great time.

2019-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,24460520,D & J,"PROS: Fantastic location in one of our favorite neighborhoods in Sydney, clean flat, not cluttered.

CONS:

This was a last minute booking, booked on the day as we had enquired about checking in the following day but as it was sitting empty we decided we may as well go ahead and switch rather than extend our current place as we had to check out the next day when the owner was returning period since the flat was sitting empty, as hosts ourselves, we figured they would probably be glad to get an extra night stay and additional money, but instead she acted as if she was doing us a favour.

We had requested to leave our bags with the cleaner as we were checking out at 11am from our current flat at the time - knowing the cleaner would be at this flat prior to 3 preparing it for us (we wanted to put perishables in the refrigerator). We were told no, that we could not drop our bags, for the cleaners safety. This was very strange since we have hundreds of reviews, have been hosting an Airbnb in Manhattan and other cities for nearly 10 years, are superhosts (not to mention one of us is an NYC attorney, weighs 93 lbs/42 kilos and only owns 5 inch plus heels and dresses and such and looks quite dressed up and out of place in Sydney to begin with, I only wear fitted trousers and loafers, so neither of us exactly look like the sort that would be intimidating any cleaners), and since we are Airbnb hosts/guests. 
She stated that clearly we must understand this ourselves, so we replied that we absolutely always (at no additional charge) do our best to accommodate guests checking in early or checking out late, and that even on same day turns, we do this, and we absolutely always allow people to drop off their bags even before the cleaner has cleaned or if she is there so that they don’t have to carry them around with them and may enjoy their limited time in the cities in which we host (mind you on two continents).

She continued to state that surely we understand, which obviously we made clear that we did not, but okay, we will drop our bags at the 3 pm check-in time and sit around with them nearby until then.

We then checked in and realized no fans were provided. There is a ceiling fan in the bedroom but the living room gets no circulation at all (faces a wall), so on hot days and nights it gets very stuffy. Also, it is a pocket wifi, not a proper modem, so do not expect great wifi. We continually received error pages, directing us to the internet providers information site (ie the sort you get if you haven’t paid your bill or have run out of data). Annie states in her informational section in the flat and on Airbnb the Wi-Fi is quite poor in Australia and Sydney, but we visit Sydney every year and usually rent a townhouse in Paddington (unfortunately has been sold since last year and this was a very last minute New Year’s Eve trip), and obviously had switched from another flat which was just a five minute walk away, and have never had any issues with Wi-Fi previously.
The host did send us a partial refund for this, upon a few reminders (I should add that she had stated when we checked in that we could extend a day, as they had an empty day before their next booking, but then after we had complained about the Wi-Fi and she offered us ~US$35 as a credit, she stated that we could not extend a day, and that is when we again reminded her about the WiFi credit extended, as we had planned to put it towards our additional day). 

The roof is not really usable, as it is so small with a giant laundry hanging rack that fills the majority of it and the rest is filled with a table, so the one time we tried to use it, it was pretty awkward as if anyone else is up there, not only is all the space taken but it’s kind of awkward to have to say sorry and turn right back around as you basically walk right into them. Plus they’re over your head (the flat is on the top floor), so you hear them walking around and moving the table and such, but obviously sound isn’t a huge issue coming from Manhattan. 
There isn’t a view by any means, so we really missed the roof we’d moved from. 

Finally, Annie, the manager, messaged us the day prior to leaving just to remind us we had to be out by 10am. Sorry, but not only is 10am early (which didn’t matter as we had a flight to catch anyway), but messaging on your final day kind of puts you in a bad mood telling you to be out so early (and not politely either). As hosts, we always message the morning of check out, so as to respect the fact that guests might be trying to enjoy their final day and don’t want to sour any final time.  

Its a shame other hosts can be so rigid and inhospitable, in so many ways."

2016-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Peter,"We were visiting our daughter in Sydney and we enjoyed our 16 day’s stay at Fred & Bernadette's place very much. The unit is fully self contained, clean and has everything you need (including wifi, Netflix and laundry possibilities). Malabar is a lovely town with a nice quiet beach, great ocean pool, restaurant overlooking the water (open from Wednesday till Sunday) and a beach cafe (open till 15.30 on Friday and Saturday till 20.30). The bus 399, takes 45 minutes to Central Quay, stops in front of the house and in the evening at a 2 minutes walk. For the bigger shopping centers, as detailed in the welcome book, you can better use a car, smaller shops are on a 10 to 15 minutes walk. Fred & Bernadette were very helpful, thanks for using the opal cards. I highly recommend this place."
2015-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,6201263,Shehan,Stayed at Yoco's house for a week and a half and it was great. Ideal location close to the city and good value. Robbie was a great host! Will definitely be booking it again next time I'm in Sydney.

Oliver and Hugo responses very quickly, there was no communication problem. The only downside was bugs - cockroaches. So we sprayed insecticide, like every morning before we left. "
2016-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Jon,Desireé the host was very friendly and replied quickly to any questions. The apartment was a little noisy from the road outside but it wasn't a big issue. It has obviously been recently renovated and is very clean. There was tea/coffee and milk which was a convenient touch. I would recommend this Airbnb.

They really loved all the cool decks attached to the bedrooms - the city views are brilliant.

Jeremy himself is a very helpful and welcoming host. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to do the inner-city experience and not skimp on comfort!"
2016-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Steve,"This was an exceptionally great central apartment within easy walking distance to all of the iconic Sydney landmarks. We had very good communication with our host Gavin who was very accommodating as he allowed us to leave our luggage at the appartment so as we could enjoy our last day without having to carry heavy baggage around with us. The apartment was to a high standard and very clean. We would highly recommend this appartment to anyone with children, groups or just couples as it will meet everyones needs. Thank you so much Gavin for your hospitality."
2016-05-09T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,June,"Kath's apartment was a great way to start our vacation. We stayed in the room with the balcony and had plenty of room. Kath supplied bread, fruit and other breakfast items. We also enjoyed the many bakeries that are close to the apartment. Kath thought of everything from a fridge in the room, big bath towels, washer and dryer, to Tim Tam cookies. We enjoyed pleasant conversations and Kath was a great asset in dealing with our little emergency.  Kath was willing for us to check in early in the morning after flying in from the US. The only drawback was sharing the small bathroom with the other Airbnb guests who were staying there, but this was just a minor inconvenience. "
2017-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Melissa,"Wayne and Kate's place is everything that we imagined. We stayed there for 5 nights and wished we could have extended our trip! 

First of all, Wayne and Kate are wonderful hosts. They were very responsive and was happy to answer all of our questions. They were also very accommodating and allowed us to check-in earlier and check-out later to match our flight schedules. Checking in and out was super convenient as they left us with very clear instructions. A manual regarding the apartment was also given to make navigating around the place easier. They even left us coffee and a bottle of bubbles to welcome us! 

Their apartment is right on Tamarama Beach (2 mins walking), and about 15-20 mins walk from Bondi Beach making it very convenient to go shopping, have a coffee or breakfast! 

The apartment itself was very clean, and all toilet amenities (including shampoo, conditioner, hairdryer, clean towels etc) were provided. 

Even though they didn't have air conditioners, they provided us with huge fans that kept us cool throughout our stay. 

I highly recommend their place, can't wait to visit again!

2017-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,18338274,Ela,"Bills's Place is exactly as described and with 4 bedrooms certainly has plenty of space. 
We loved the little courtyard in the back with the fishpond. 
The beautiful antique furniture and deco was a nice touch to a classic terrace house in contrast to the modern kitchen and bathroom.
The house manual was very helpful in explaining everything to do with the house.
Location is perfect, just 2 minutes walk to the light rail and 2 minutes to shops and restaurants. 
Bill was very helpful with our request to extend our stay a couple of hours so we didn't need to wait at the airport.  We would definitely like to stay again."

2015-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Jules,"We absolutely loved our stay at Michy's lovely cabin on Pittwater. It is even more beautiful in real life than the photos show. Michy went out of her way to accommodate us and make us feel at home, and was also very respectful of our privacy. The cabin is a delight, and full of lovely touches that made us completely spoiled. It's literally right on the water too. It rained the whole time we were there but we were so cosy in our beautiful cabin and enjoying cups of tea on the verandah that we didn't care at all. The Yoda Food restaurant in Avalon just 5 mins away is delicious too! Thank you Michy for a wonderful and much needed rest in your delightful cabin xx"
2018-08-30T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Matthew,"Richard's cottage is definitely an even better experience than the pictures suggest, very scenic views and lots of comfort. We used the cottage as a unique location for a film production. Richard was extremely helpful in providing local knowledge for ease of logistical preparations. The one trouble my team experienced was unrelated to the location, however, a result of the location's remoteness (only accessible by water). That problem was that the Barge Service cancelled on us due to unexpectedly rough (unsafe) water and wind conditions, which affected schedule on our bump in. You also must not forget anything as it is not practical to run errands if you forget to bring anything with you. Other than this, the film shoot went very well and everyone was excited by the cottage and its views. On another note: the neighbours were incredibly friendly and helpful. It was very easy to make contact with them, liaise with them leading up to the shoot and on the day they were very cooperative on a few requests of ours. The water taxi and barge service operators were also friendly, punctual and cooperative. I would recommend this place and hope to someday return for a weekend holiday to this paradise corner - it really is a hidden gem of Sydney."

There were makeup stains and grubby marks on the pillows and doona cover, little spiders on the ceiling throughout the house, hair on the pillows, doona cover and throughout the bathroom on the shower walls and on the toilet. It was very uncomfortable and we were glad we only booked one night. If it was cleaned properly it would have been a great place to stay."
2018-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,7439246,Judy,"Great place in excellent location. So close to the beautiful beach and bus stop right by the apartment made everything easy.

There was a small issue, but the excellent communication of the owners contacted us straight away and sorted it out promptly.

Thanks for the lovely stay."
2017-06-19T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Christina,Mohit made communication so easy and we had no problem communicating with him. The place is lovely and the balcony is a fantastic place to chill with friends/family. Will definitely be back again!
2017-07-29T04:00:00.000Z,10091713,Martina,"Warm, light filled studio, compact but has everything you need. View from the loo window is pretty cool. 
An abundance of eating & drinking places all within an easy walk, (recommend the 'Shakespeare pub' 200 Devonshire st, for their Thursday night fish and chip special).
Again handy location for the single or couple travellers, easy key pickup and great communication with Ben."

2016-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Sonia,"Susan was very welcoming! She picked me up from the station on my arrival day! My first day it rained hard all day so I stayed at the house and caught up using wifi!  Susan kindly invited me to go to her swimming club with her which I enjoyed , the exercise was good!
Susan encourages use of kitchen and is not 'precious' about her stuff. She provides a nice breakfast of cereals , some fruit, juice and toast :-)"
2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Kim,"I really appreciate for their house and kindness. Thank you.
I couldn't forget memory in Sydney."
2015-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Rachel,"Thank you for everything. Ashley and Duncan took turns to chat with us, though all of us was in and out quite alot. 
Glad we had time to hang out briefly. 
All as described- clean and crisp, and felt truly welcome."
2018-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Teri,Great host! Place was very clean and perfect location for catching bus into Sydney which we did often.  And of course it was great to have a view and beautiful breezes. Grateful for the tips on eateries and Anita's quick responses.  Lovely stay!  Highly recommend.
2018-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Melissa,Michele’s place is wonderful. It’s in a nice quiet street but is close to everything in Newtown! We had a great time and will definitely be back!
2018-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Pippa,"The unit was very clean, well designed and remarkably quiet while being at the heart of Newtown. It is close to public transport and all the amenities of Newtown. Narelle was a very responsive host, she replied to emails promptly and checked with us that all was well during our stay. The self check-in instructions were clear and easy to follow. Narelle had provided a short list of things to do in Newtown. We know Newtown well having visited a couple of times before, so my only suggestion for improvement would be some more comprehensive information about Sydney. Otherwise I wholeheartedly recommend this unit to other travellers and would definitely stay here again."

2017-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Gillian,Davids place was in an excellent location - easily accessible by underground and quick to the airport. Check in was made easy and his communication was excellent with us. Good value for money. Lots of nice little cafes and juice bars nearby.
2017-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Ally,Vickie is a very helpful and gracious host. Will definitely come again. Thanks so much!!
2018-08-30T04:00:00.000Z,27009904,Sally,This is ideal accommodation for a couple or a single traveller who wants to be near the city and on the Airport route.  Lovely modern clean functional accommodation and welcoming hosts.
2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Charlotte,"Good location, walking distance to China Town, Sydney Opera House, Darling Harbour. Host is nice and helpful. But unfortunately the air conditioner, oven and parts of the stove not work during our stay. Hope host can fix them soon as to bring the best experience to guests. Not bad experience at all."
2018-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,22509800,Kara,"We stayed for 3 night here, Sally's place is so close to everything. Fast responses to questions. I would definitely recommend this apartment."
2016-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Catherine,Cat's house was in the best location. Just around the corner from great coffee shops and just a short walk to Bondi Beach. Bondi Beach itself is still only a 15 minute car ride to the city so it was terrific. The place was lovely and clean and beds very comfortable.
2018-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,1131054,Paul,This place is a knockout ... stylishly decorated really well located ... short walk to anything you need in upscale area ... just perfect no complaints will return

2019-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,22268452,Bernard,"This place suited me perfectly. I’m not sure if it’s the same for everyone but it was for me. Very clean and functional. Small but enough for my use. Vicinity to Rose Bay wharf is unbelievably close. 

I would come back here if I needed to stay in the vicinity."
2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Jim,Great if you need an overnight stay for an event around the rocks or Opera House
2017-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Lucie,"Our stay was truly lovely! We were welcomed by freshly made banana bread and some groceries to get us started. The location is near the ocean, beach, rock pool and golf courses. Great with kids or if you want your peace :) Having a car is more comfortable but there is a bus too."
2018-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,23210058,Andrea,Perfect location for a beach holiday and lovely place to stay.
2014-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,2609433,James,"We had a lovely stay here - just one night. Quiet, relaxing, a lovely second floor room and picturesque backyard."
2015-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Mavis,"They're really nice host. Fred welcome us into his apt when we arrive & help us out with the foldable sofa. It was pouring on that day so he lend us umbrellas as well. Apt was neat,tidy & clean. They have juice &water in the fridge as well as brownies as a welcome gesture. We enjoyed 2 days of stay there. They also have an awesome view of the sea just outside the house which we really like.  Would love to stay there again if I vist again. 

Thanks for having us Fred & Bernadette :)  "
2015-11-03T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Sebastian,David was a great host. Everything need was provided. Room was clean and cosy all bars were in walking distance. I had a great time in Sydney. I can highly recommend his place. Thumbs up!
2017-03-07T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Jackie,"Thanks to Pamela and Hugo for being a great host! We arrived a few hours earlier after a long journey from Canada. Pamela and Hugo managed to get us in right away. The place has great view of the Royal Botanic Garden area and the ocean. It is very clean and safe. Pamela and Hugo provide a lot of stuff, including tea, milk, and etc. for guests to do simple cooking, to keep clean, and to enjoy the life in Sydney! The location is really central, 2 minutes walk to Town Hall Station, Woolworths supermarket, Queen Victoria Building; and only 25 minutes walk to the Opera House; very convenient to tourists. We love the host and the place!"
2018-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,20578419,중엽,중앙역과 가까워 교통이 편리하고 걸어서 주변을 관광하기에 좋았음
2018-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Jacob,"Stylish place, great bedroom, nice bathroom. Super easy check in. 15min walk from train station, quiet street."
2018-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,27009904,穗玲,"We had a impressive experience in our stay. It’s a safe, clean and really stylish room. The hosts are very nice and sweet who would prepare some snacks for us in case we will feel hungry anytime. Beside, the place is so convenient that we can easily access to everywhere in this city we want to go. Really recommend it to you."
2016-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Si Pui,"Paul's place in Potts Point was perfect for our two week stay in Sydney. Location wise it was spot on with the station just a couple of minutes away, buses on our doorstep and just walks away restaurants, coffee shops and more. Paul was an absolute pleasure to liaise with. He would respond so quickly, answering any questions we had. We can't thank him enough for letting us stay in his lovely apartment. 
If I had to choose one con, it would be the noise from the street below. We struggled with it one night out of our 12 so it wasn't too bad for us but if you're a lightsleeper, you may need earplugs. "
2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Kiah,"This is a lovely space! Stylish, not too big or too small. We would even have had room for a 3rd visitor, if our plans had not changed. We could hear the fountain across the street flowing all night, which acted as white noise to help us sleep. The location is perfect, a short walk to the train station. If you're in the mood for a slightly longer walk, you could walk all the way to the Australian Museum, which is what my boyfriend & I did after a lovely breakfast at Marcelle (just next door). :)"
2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Sunyoung,"시티에서 조금 떨어져있는 거리지만
시티까지 가는 버스가 도보2분 거리에 있고
중대형 마트가 집앞에 바로 있어서 편했어요! 실내는 정말 깨끗하고 잘 정돈되어 있었고 햇빛도 정말 잘 들어옵니다!"
2019-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,22020910,Alix,"This apartment was one of the best experiences I have had on Air B&B. Anita has a tidy, organized and comfortable home with the most spectacular views. The apartment sits on the south end of Bondi with direct access to the beach. The building is a little older, but that does not matter when you have a home in such a magical place. Anita is a wonderful host, taking the time to share local information, being always readily available and just a lovely, kind person. The access to the city is super easy, with the bus directly outside the front door. I would never stay in a hotel in Bondi again, as this place is far better value."
2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,4872526,Carissa,It’s a granny flat and the aircon doesn’t reach the bedroom so was hot. Peter was nice but the price for the place that we were provided was poor
2019-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Ian,"Lovely apartment in the heart of the city with view towards Darling Harbour, well presented and clean"
2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Thabs,"Mariana is an excellent host. She will communicate almost everything you need to know about the apartment when you check in. I especially appreciated the road maps and travel guides in the apartment. I knew I had found a truly Airbnb wonderful host when she recommended I take an ""apple cider vinegar and baking soda"" bath after my long 24-hour flight from Germany. The bath was nice!"
2018-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,30479760,Novita,Lower your expectation! :)

2015-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Megan,"Rachel gave us excellent instructions on how to find her home and upon arrival we couldn't have wished for anything more.

 The beds were outrageously comfortable, the neighbourhood was quiet with a village like atmosphere and the house itself was well equipped with all the things one needs to make a visit memorable.... and then there was the spa bath!!"
2018-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,6046461,Clinton,"Suzie is lovely, the apartment is immaculate and the interior is beautiful. As for location you couldn't get much better, next to Darling Harbour with amazing places to eat and the CBD so close."

2018-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Laura,"Spent 7 nights at Manly Beach and loved every minute of it. The location is great - quick walk to the Corso, the beach or the ferry. There is a lot to explore just walking around. From the outside, the building could use some TLC but Ziggy’s Place is well cared for, bright and airy. The bed is comfortable, bathroom spacious and the place is clean. Lots of towels and toiletries provided, including beach towels. Enjoyed the balcony although the views aren’t that great, there isn’t much foot traffic below, except when the cafe is open but that isn’t a bother. It’s great for bird watching and we were lucky to have cockatoos and lorikeets and noisy miners come to our balcony. Enjoyed the whirlpool and did use the BBQ. Did not use the laundry $6 to wash and dry a load. Neighbors are quiet. Most of all, loved going into the city but coming back to Manly."
2017-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,14223095,Mohana,"My partner and I had a wonderful stay at Krythia's place. Spotlessly clean, easy to access and very comfortable. Krythia is a great host."
2018-05-21T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Sharon,"This cozy apartment is conveniently located near the train (Kings Cross Station) and the weekend market in the park. 
WiFi is strong and lots of hangers! Nice to have travel books and maps available also. 
Excellent and a good price."

2018-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,16898275,Alan,"Thank you Trent for your prompt replies to all our enquiries before and during our 3 week stay at your home.  We were very comfortable there.  It was ideal for visiting our family and would definitely stay there again on future visits, if we had the opportunity.  Location was excellent with shops close by for every day needs and with public transport – buses and ferry - at the end of the street."
2016-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Shinta,"We didn't meet Nicole and Simon when we arrived yet Nicole was very responsive with our inquiry and sent us the details of key pick up location. The check in process were seamless and we found the parking easily.

The apartment has a great location, only minutes away from great restaurants and I found a great hairdresser just 5 minutes away who knows my hairdresser in Canberra. What a small world!

I like the toiletries provided in the apartment. Normally I use Aesop products and the Brown Alchemist products were very similar to what I normally used. 

I also like the way they provided everything that we might need in a trip such as umbrella, hair dryer, even Opal cards (we have our own but it must be really handy for someone new to Sydney). We walked to central station and enjoying the gigs and shows at Sydney Festival. The Uber charge from the city was less than $10. 

Thanks Nicole and Simon for sharing your nice place with us. We'll stay again if we are going to Sydney next time :)"
2014-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Julian,"If you are seeking a charmingly rustic, secluded getaway to a cottage located twenty metres from a stunning protected beach; look no further.

Getting to the house is a boating adventure directly from Palm Beach (either by the ferry, the friendly local boat house, or the water taxi). Not being able to drive to the house is a nice removal from the mundane, however make sure you pack accordingly.

The main sandstone cottage is designed to effortlessly entertain large or small groups of people. The generous outdoor setting is nicely accompanied by extra deck chairs and umbrellas.

Richard and Claudia have very tastefully arranged the homely living interiors and bedrooms. The tree-house (bedroom and bathroom), removed from the main cottage, is fantastic and you are treated to a stunning elevated view to the East. Watching sunrise over the ocean from the comfort of  bed is pretty special.

The quiet location means sleeping with the doors open to the sound of gentle waves is a must, and the house is well stocked with mosquito coils to make the pests don't interrupt.

The recently renovated kitchen contains everything needed for cooking, and is complemented by the large BBQ outside.

There are walking trails nearby which can take you to the West Head lookout, Aboriginal Archaeological sites, and tiny beaches dotted around the headland.

All-in-all, a very pleasant stay, and we look forward to any opportunity to return."
2019-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,16234640,Christine,"Excellent apartment loved the space.
So close to Ferry and trains beautiful spot, would recommend"
2018-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,22005432,Mark,"Treen’s place is fantastic, and suited our family of 6 perfectly. It’s spacious, modern and bright, and she was kind enough to leave toys and books for our kids, which was incredibly helpful. The location is ideal, just 3 minutes walk to the trendy cafes on Hall St and 5 minutes walk to the beach. Treen was a fantastic host - very helpful and accommodating before our arrival, and available during our stay - though we didn’t need her, since the place was so great. Her home is perfect for families or a group of 6 looking for a charming house in the heart of one of Sydney’s best neighborhoods."
2018-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,22068048,Glenn,I just keep coming back. My favourite of all times. Lucy provides a superb air bnb experience. The peace  privacy and tranquillity combined with an incredibly comfortable and well appointed accommodation makes this feel like your second home.
2018-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Rhonda,"Terrific in every way!  Susan was an amazing host.  Upon my arrival, she warmly greeted me like I was a long lost friend. The space is beautiful and shows such attention to detail. It could be featured in a home design magazine. Delicious yogurt, fresh fruit, and granola plus teas and coffees were provided. The linens were so cozy, I slept like a baby. The place had every special touch you can imagine. Susan gave great recommendations and was so helpful.  The location is ideal.  It's a short walk to a small grocer, pharmacy, and coffee shops and cafes, plus a most amazing bakery. You must eat breakfast at Three Blue Ducks. A little beyond the shops lies the big, blue sea that can be enjoyed by walking the coastal trail or from one of the local beaches. Bronte and Bondi beaches are easily accessible on foot."
2017-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,17606304,Imogen,"This place was great. Much more spacious than I expected for a one bedroom unit (long hallway, big kitchen, lounge room and bedroom). The place was absolutely spotless when we arrived, especially the bathroom, which is always so important (hate when the bathroom is dirty!) Patrick and Christine were so accommodating when we had a last minute change of plans and asked if we could check in early to get ready for an event that afternoon. I will definitely stay here again!"
2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,22661818,Andrew,"Kate was a great host and had an exceptional apartment. Kate was amazing to deal with through her quick responses and friendly attitude. We had a wonderful time in Manly in her apartment. The apartment itself was stylish, clean, had great facilities and offered exceptional beachfront views. The garage offered safe and easy parking for our stay in Manly and the secondary car park in front of the garage was an added bonus. With the apartment being a walking distance to all main attractions, it made the apartment location a perfect stay for us.

We left Kate’s apartment with a better stay then expected, we loved the apartment and our stay in Manly. We highly recommend Kate and her apartment!"
2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Mark,"Our 11 days stay was great, Ali was very helpful when messaged her questions about the area and bus routes. Was a perfect location for what we were doing Australia, Hillsong Church/College is a 10 minute bus ride! Thanks for everything, I’m sure we will stay again next year when we go visit our daughter at the college! "
2019-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,22295401,Hannah,"Griffin's met us for check in which was super nice as we arrived quite late, he had also got us some fresh fruit. The place is in the perfect location for transport around the city. It is a pretty busy area at night on the weekends but this isn't an issue in the apartment. Everything was as we expected, lovely and clean. This place is perfect for a trip to Sydney."
2015-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,6033723,Sheila,"Jonny was a lovely guy that made us feel very comfortable in his home. The apartment is fresh and clean with a comfortable bed, it is in a great location with just a few minutes walk to the centre of Manly and the Wharf to get a ferry to the city."
2016-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,6361929,Melissa,Edi was very welcoming to her home.  She was very quick and responsive on taking us in on the very last minute. Thank you for your help.

2013-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,1098211,Annie,"Serena's apartment is centrally-located and near a lot of great restaurants and bars. The coffee shop next door was really nice. Serena was a great host and greeted us with a tasty breakfast basket. The apartment itself was nice and clean although somewhat dark and the main window faced a lightly frequented alleyway so we generally kept the blinds shut. That said, it was a good place for the price and I would recommend it."
2015-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Deborah,"Nothing is too much trouble for MissD. I had literally booked the day before. We arrived early and MissD's friendly husband was extremely helpful and accommodating preparing the room in no time and then by chance securing a perfect, handy parking space for us. Great atmosphere, locality very clean and well kept. Quality linen and fluffy thick towels. We would love to stay again. "
2018-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Amber,"Great directions. I am directionally challenged and I found this easily. Super clean, great bed, little bit of road noise but I slept very well. One hop and skip from the airport, we took the bus and it was cheap and easy. Thanks Hernan!"
2018-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,14223095,Michelle Linda,This place was close to Balmoral beach and nice places to eat. Having a car spot was handy to travel to the northern beaches of Sydney. Lots of hills in the area too. Krythia was a pleasant host.

2016-10-04T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Riley,"My wife and I spent 5 comfortable nights here. We were completely satisfied with the studio's location, security, cleanliness, spaciousness, and amenities, including the WiFi connection. Andrea communicated well with us, and kindly left us a few food items in the refrigerator. "
2017-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Xinyi,"We had a great stay here during our first two days in Sydney. The apartment is even better than in the photos, and we absolutely loved the dining area overlooking the fountain and street below! Location is perfect, walking distance to Kings Cross Station, supermarkets, CBD, SOH, and Royal Botanic Gardens. Also very clean and well-equipped, and David left us things for breakfast too which was really appreciated. David was an amazing host, and we highly recommend this place!"

2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,16813942,Jess,"Great location and beautiful house. On the quieter side of town, just a walk across the road and through a path to the beach, this beach house is beautifully decorated and comfortable. Plenty of space for people in the large dining kitchen and the two bedrooms are apart enough to suit two couples. The surrounds, even in our wet weather, were breathtaking. Great escape from reality with little 3G/4G reception and no wifi!"
2016-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,9848595,Marion,"I had such a wonderful stay at Charlie & Gioia's apartment. They gave me all the instructions I needed to get around the flat and even left a bottle of red wine. While it's a bit of a hike to get up there, Fairlight is beautiful and quiet and the walk to Manly and all the beautiful places to see around is totally worth it.

2017-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Krystal,The room is pretty clean.The location is convenient as it is only a few minutes away from Newtown Station. It can get a bit noisy though due to planes and traffic.

2018-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Siying,"Shuang’s place is sparkling clean and has all amenities that you would have. Check in is super easy without bothering the host or other guests. The suburbs is quiet and close to the airport (10mins walking to the railway station then only one stop from there.. should be cheaper taking Uber to get there).
Thanks Shuang for hosting me! Would love to stay at your place next time!"
2018-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,12256344,Beth,Beautiful leafy suburb close to the city. Gracious and friendly hosts.

2018-03-14T04:00:00.000Z,21851474,Liz & Conrad,"This was one of our favorite Airbnb experiences and after traveling for 7 months straight have stayed in A LOT. The interior is stunning, clean, and makes great use of a small space. We had everything we needed and then some to cook meals in as well. The bathroom was very clean and spacious and there is a washer which came in handy. Would stay again!"
2017-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,18083735,Michael,Greg is so helpful all through our stay. They are how the perfect hosts should be.

Already singing praises about Dino' s place to friends and will have no second thought about staying there again.
Thank you Dino & Rick."

2016-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,K.,"The studio's location is very accessible. Its a few minutes walk from both Wynyard and Circular Quay train stations. That was a major win for us. We were able to visit one place in the morning, then return and feed the kids and visit another place in the evening/night. Jared provided us plenty of everything described in the listing.

You can even see Sydney Eye Tower from one of the windows. No balcony though."
2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Rhys,Hernan is great and this was a super convenient place to stay for me.
2018-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,23493822,Vivian,The room looked exactly like the photos. It even had its own door for private entrance which was nice. It would not have been a convenient location to get to without a car but we knew that prior to booking because our friend was able to drive us around. The neighborhood is very safe and xiaowei was very nice upon arrival Everything was great for our 2 night stay!

5-10분 거리에 큰 마트 2개나 있어 좋았어요

2017-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Laila,"David was a lovely host. My check in plans kept changing on my behalf and he remained super flexible. The location is unbeatable - super close to shops, cafes and safely located to walk to and from. The private tv and netflix was a real treat - I may have binge watched a night or two free from judgement. David was a lovely warm host throughout my 4night stay. 110% recommended :)"

2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,敏,"可能是墨尔本的房东太周到了,到了悉尼就感觉到落差了,房子很宽敞,位置也很好找,只是交通不是很方便,周围只有巴士站,最近的火车站走路过去要15min钟,吃东西也不是很方便,附近只有一家便利店｡因为uber故障,所以打车也不是很好打,而且卧室的枕头里面不知道装的什么,沙沙响,不是很舒适｡细节还是有很多可以改进的,希望Wendy把民宿越做越好｡"
2017-07-19T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Vince,"The accommodation is within close proximity to Arncliffe rail station and very near taxi ride to the airport which is very handy.

2018-04-26T04:00:00.000Z,21999107,Ayela,As others have said this is one of the best air bnb places I have stayed at - the place is gorgeous and private yet conveniently located and has such a wonderful feel. I would highly recommend it.

It was very easy to get to (we walked from St. James station) and in a nice neighbourhood. The building/apartment is very secure and in a good central location.  Good places to eat close by, Bloody Mary's for breakfast was a great spot.
Also probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! "
2018-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,17829178,Vickie,"Great location, easy to find, nice neighborhood, self check in super convenient and efficient, place is clean and nicely decorated with everything you need, except coffee. Walls are thin so you can hear people talk or walk by but not a big issue for me as at night when you sleep it is quiet. What bothers me is the second night it was very windy after the thunderstorm, something kept banging  on the window periodically and woke me up at 5am. Unsure how often it gets windy or is it just me who’s unlucky."
2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,13852692,Sue,Beautiful and spacious place in a great location.

We even got something priceless from Duncan (no further details to avoid everyone expecting this)"

Private entry was great and check-in and out was a super easy and smooth process with all details sent through the day before. The shops and public transport a super close, an easy walk away. Cannot fault it, was a lovely place to stay for a long weekend, close to family living in the area. Thanks."

2016-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Svenja,The room is exactly like the pictures and the balcony is very nice. It was really close to the train station and you are very fast in the city.
2018-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Xiaosi,"It absolutely is a good accommodation in Sydney. The house is large and the facilities in house is complete. However, the shower water is too cold. Maybe it will be better if it has a calorifier. Anyways, the house is in the city centre and house price is quite cheap. It is high performance cost ratio."
2015-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Danica,"We found our heaven at Richard and Claudia's place at Mackerel. It was an ideal home and location for our family and the holiday we wanted.
Richard's communication was always prompt and helpful, and he and Claudia went out of their way to assist us with several aspects of our stay. "
2017-03-12T05:00:00.000Z,17438054,Kyra,"I was in Sydney with my family for a holiday and we've had a lovely stay at this new granny flat. It was above and beyond our expectations. If I could rate it, it would be an easy 10/10. This place was way better than a 5-star hotel. This was my first Airbnb experience and they have set the bar so high. From day one, George and Lucia had been nothing but helpful, attentive and on the ball of everything. There was so much thought given to every little detail of the house. The house was super clean and it always had an amazing scent. Fresh linen and towels were provided, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The kitchen was fully equipped and everything needed to cook was there, including the recipe books. Commuting was rather easy. We took the train most of the time to travel to the city. The nearest train station is Kingsgrove Station which is about 10-15 minutes walking distance. Opal cards can be purchased from a convenience store at the station. We also downloaded the ""Opal Travel"" app to check on the train times and fare estimate. The nearest supermarket is Woolworths which is only 2 min walk from the train station. There are many restaurants around the train station too. This place has truly made us feel like home and there is absolutely nothing better than returning to a cozy house after a really long day in the city. George and Lucia were the best host we could ever ask for. We will definitely stay here again if we return to Sydney :)"
2015-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Lexi,I booked Marcella's place on behalf of family and she was extremely communicative in making sure their needs were met and that getting in was trouble-free. I would recommend dealing with Marcella without hesitation!

The studio is so lovely (we both agreed it was our best Airbnb experience in the last 5years), comfy, calm, perfectly located (very close from the beach and good restaurants). 
Susan and her husband are very good and caring host.
Fully recommend the place !
Thank you Susan :) "

2018-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Manisha,Loved the location (5 mins walk and your in Circular Quay) and the apartments high ceilings (its top floor). Was also surprised to find a small but lovely pool area on the roof.
2018-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Tiina,"This apartment is very interesting on 3 levels so make sure you can handle stairs;)
I found the location fascinating. Directly opposite the railway station and work going on putting in the light rail but it did not impact in the evening at all. 
Loved sitting on the balcony with generous bottle of supplied Chardonnay,  people and train watching. And the lovely city lights beyond. Though the trains seem to go through the night ( I looked if I got up) I did not hear (Email hidden by Airbnb) fortable mattress (on floor as in photos) and lounge to relax on after a long day out and about. 
I wish I’d had time to read some of those great looking books!
Very homey and comfy and great location to get to anywhere!"
2018-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,17027421,Chris,Excellent place to stay.  Yvonne and Carey's house is beautiful and extremely clean.  We felt very welcomed and they went out of their way to be gracious hosts.  Wonderful to talk to and great communicators.

2018-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,20767798,Kathryn,"If you would prefer a place in Sydney to use as a base, this is it. Perfectly positioned amongst everything Sydney-ish. A good space to lightly relax with another couple after a concert or night out on the town. Maybe not a place you would chill in for a weekend to 'get away from it all'.
Good beds, although light buffer to noise on Bridge St & George St, and air con in slightly larger room.
Bathroom tricky to feel comfortable in, but clean, as for kitchen.
Very reliable communication with check-in etc.
Easy, has the basics for what you need and notes well communicated in explanatory information."
2017-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,15920870,Julie,"My husband and I stayed here for a week. The place is great, it had everything we needed.

We checked in on a Saturday (race day) and got to watch some of the horses race by from the balcony...with a glass of wine! I also enjoyed watching the horses being trained/walked early in the mornings. 

The TV was huge and we enjoyed watching Netflix/Stan. Having WiFi was also a bonus.

We would definitely recommend friends/family to stay here. We would stay again.

Thanks Oliver!"

2014-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Anne,"This is a great holiday house to stay in.  We are a family of 5 and were very comfortable in the space.  The flat was nice and clean with all the kitchen essentials, plenty of seating and an outside area which we used a lot too.  The area is great, the shops are close enough to walk to and just up the road there are lots of different restaurants and a fantastic patisserie.  The bus services are excellent with buses every few minutes into the city and down to Coogee Beach... Look out for the family funday sunday tickets at $2.50 per person for full day travel on buses, trains and ferries (if you are travelling with kids)!"

2017-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Neil,"The place is very large, with very big common areas that could accommodate everyone twice over. The location is great with transport connections from the airport bring very simple with short walk and train ride. The surrounding cafes and parks. Given the look in photos I was concerned that my 1 and 3 year old might reek havoc this was not the case. The little outdoor areas and the nearby playground were great for them. Supermarket  cafes, pubs are 5mins walk away. Vanessa was helpful and quick to respond."
2018-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,15920870,Andrew,"The apartment is exceptionally clean, comfortable and perfectly presented. Oliver is extremely hospitable and lightning fast with communication and thoughtfulness. He went above and beyond letting me drop off some luggage early. Easy check-in/ out and perfectly located for quietness, yet close to anything you need. Everything was much better than expected, don't hesitate to book this place because I will next time I have the opportunity. The view of the race track while having coffee each morning was pretty cool too!"
2015-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Jessie,The wonderful expenrience has made our tour Sydney a memorable one. Not only the amazing appearance of the modern apartment but also the cozy home-like atmosphere make it suitable for tourists travelling in this city.

2014-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,927923,Chloe,"Julia and her sister Adelle are friendly and helpful, they always respond to my enquiry within a day. When we reached their place after a tiring flight, Adelle gave us a warm welcome and they even prepared some snacks for us. That was very thoughtful.. The unit is clean and tidy, with a big bedroom and a cute kitchen. It's located at a great neighborhood, convenient and quiet. The unit is within walking distance to ferry and bus stop. We stayed for two months and spent a really great time there. PS, do try the pizza shop nearby, you won't be disappointed!"
2016-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Natascha,"The place is exactly as presented in the pictures. Its clean, well stocked and the location is perfect for getting around all the sites while still enjoying a good nights sleep.

2017-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Felicity,"We absolutely loved our stay at the garden studio - the only bad thing was having to leave! It's the perfect base for solo travellers or couples to explore Sydney and is definitely the best equipped Air BnB we've stayed in to date. The breakfast basket was fab, as were the delicious cookies we found on our doorstep when we arrived home  on our last night. Cath was super helpful and friendly (as was Hazelnut the adorable pup!). Highly recommend and would definitely stay again.  "

The room was huge and had all the amenities you would need. Very clean bathroom with your own drawer to house your toiletries. Yoco wasn't in town but was easy to communicate with.

Thank you Stephen for opening up your place on Airbnb."
2017-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Coral,"Sarah is a very warm and welcoming person, and the accommodation was very clean and comfortable. I highly recommend staying at Sarah's place if you want somewhere that is comfortable and a very gracious host.

2014-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,794910,HuiShan,Gavin's place is extremely convenient & a short walk to some of the greatest meals on earth. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Sydney! The best part is that Gavin is always up for a conversation about anything (thanks for the insight into Australian politics!). Anyone who wants to experience the beautiful Surry Hills neighbourhood should stay here. It really is incredible.

Gavin's appartment is very well located - just a few step further and you are in Central Station - in a cool and trendy neighbourhood.
About the room - it has been renovated, spacious and the matress is awesome :)

2017-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,16609607,Andrew,"Great location with pretty well all the amenities provided. It has been several years since I'd last spent time in Chippendale, and what's been done with the old brewery site is fantastic. Some really good restaurants to explore!"
2016-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Michael,"This is a very convenient, cosy and perfect appartment in the center of a lot of action: Central station is 8 minutes to walk and then your are close to all attractions in Sydney. The neighbourhood us lovely, typical Sydney townhouses with a great pub on the other side of Abecrombie Street. It is 6 minutes walk to the train station Redfern.
The appartment has all you need and the shopping for these needs is at Redfern station.
Linda is a very helpful host, always available by sms if you need advice.
This unit is very recomendable for 2 or 4 people. Have fun! Thank you Linda!

2017-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Kate,Place was lovely with everything you would need for a night or two away. Can highly recommend a pre-dinner drink across the road at a little private beach followed by dinner at the Clareville kiosk which is only a few minutes drive from here.
2018-03-12T04:00:00.000Z,18047246,Michael,Couldn't get a better deal! Well worth a try. (We got the spider man bed linen!)
2019-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,21127680,Yelim,"외국인들 후기에 베리 클린, 클린이라은 얘기가 많아서 깨끗한 줄 알았는데 아니에욥^*^ 생각보다 낡았고 못 쓸 정도는 아니었는데 와!!!깨끗!! 이정도는 아니었지만 뭐,,, 쓸만하네,,, 정도였어요
위치는 뮤지엄역에서 5분, 센트럴에서 5분 정도로 엄청 좋아요
근처에 12시까지 하는 coles도 있어요
가격 대비 가성비는 굳!
전반적으로 만족하지만 화장실이 호텔급으로 깨끗했으면 하면 별로일 거 같아요"
2018-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,12117514,Erin,"Great location, can be noisy on weekends as busy street. Gwen is lovely though."
2016-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,6201263,Nicolas,"I had a great stay at Yoco's, it reminds me a lot the movie Auberge Espagnole with mostly europeans roommates. I didn't have the chance to meet everyone because I was very busy but I would definitely stay again at his place. Yoco was also really flexible regarding the check-in time, I was able to drop my luggage early in the morning even though the room wasn't ready yet because an another guest hadn't checked out yet, that was really convenient after a long flight from USA.

Also if you're a light sleeper, it can be loud, it's not really well soundproofing. I'm heavy sleeper it didn't disturb me."
2016-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Ingrid,"We absolutely loved our stay in Bronte. I would highly recommend staying here for a perfect weekend away. Susan and Greg were lovely. They greeted on arrival and made sure we were comfortable. Susan left me her umbrella as it was raining the day we arrived. They provided us with great tips on what to do and where to go in the area. The studio is beautiful. We were provided with tea, coffee, orange juice, chocolate and other breakfast treats. Fresh bagels were delivered to our door on the first morning. The studio is very private  and comfortable- it has everything you need and more. The wifi works well, which was important as I worked on the first day we arrived. The location is perfect. It was a lovely short walk to local cafes and to beautiful Bronte beach. We walked to Bondi along coastal walk one morning and to Coogee one evening. It was a short uber to Bondi and Coogee for a night out. I would recommend for anyone to stay here and I am now completely in love with the Bronte neighbourhood. Stay here and you'll feel like a local! "
2016-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,10213499,Raja,We had a great experience at Tracy's place in Narrabeen. The apartment was a great size and located just off of Narrabeen lake. We would definitely recommend staying here and would do so again!
2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Ricardo,Great apartment with amazing views. Much better value than staying at a hotel. Highly recommended.
2018-01-24T05:00:00.000Z,17606304,Bridge,We had a lovely stay. The house was just like in the photos. Confortable bedding and a cute courtyard where thé kids could go outside. Situated on a main road so maybe a bit noisy because of vehicles at times. Very clean. Duplex.
2018-05-24T04:00:00.000Z,15889399,Mahavir Gabriel,"Steven is an excellent host, very friendly and supportive. Location is very clean, full of light, simple and nicely equipped, for both, work and relaxation. Unless bothered by some transient airplanes flying over Petersham, which you can get used easily, then the place is also very quiet."
2018-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,24848349,Gavin,Thank you Ian & Carol for your hospitality and hosting. Thoroughly enjoyed our time in Sydney and felt very comfortable in your home. Want to mention how convenient the location was and how helpful you were in getting us around town & picking up from the train too! If we come to Sydney together I’d like to stay there again! Thank you so much!
2017-06-14T04:00:00.000Z,15923846,Kane,Great stay in a great home. Would recommend!

2015-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Marnie,Our stay in Bronte was lovely. Communication with Susan was easy and clear. Susan and Greg were welcoming and very respectful if our space and privacy. We knew they were around if needed though felt we had our own space too. A great little pad in the gorgeous Bronte. Highly recommended . Thank you
2017-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Mark,"Very good value for location, nice apartment with a great view!"
2014-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,David,"Absolutely great place to stay and a wonderful experience. The apartment itself is very nice and very comfortable; it is light, airy, relaxing - all the things a beachside apartment should be. And the location just can't be beat. It is right on the beach and right next to everything you want to be near, while retaining the laid-back 'neighbourhood' vibe that the best parts of Bondi seem to manage. The views are, needless to say, spectacular. 

Mal was very friendly, offering us some local insights into places we might want to check out (or avoid) and although we didn't call him again after we checked in, he was sure to let us know we could call if we needed anything. In short, the perfect place to stay in Sydney. Would go back again in a second."
2019-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,17028088,Leonie,This is an amazing place to stay. Close to the wonderful Centennial Parklands and the apartment was immaculate- there is nothing I could fault about this place or the host.
2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Ian,"Great place, great neighborhood, great host! We stayed for 10 days and felt right at home."

2019-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,22005432,Ralph,The host canceled this reservation 55 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,20374683,Pearllyn,Phan's place was very comfortable for our group of 5. The apartment was clean and was convenient and easy to locate. Phan was great at responding and was always happy to help. A great stay overall!

Thumbs up!"
2014-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,1090153,David,"We stayed at Aquila House over Xmas and NY in 2013 and had a spectacular time.  The house is stylish and simple, with impressive water views and only a short walk to the beach.  It managed to take 2 adults + 2 children + various other family members and friends with kids for BBQs without seeming crowded.  My sons were amazed to hear kookaburras and have a couple of parakeets come down to join us on the terrace at breakfast.  Susie the owner was very straightforward to deal with and added some really thoughtful touches to welcome us (Xmas tree, hamper, list of best cafés and restaurants in the village).  Just be aware that you should rent a car to get around, same need if you stay anywhere  outside of the very centre of Sydney to be honest.  I highly recommend Aquila House for a genuine summer break."
2019-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Krista,Enjoyed my stay. Was exactly what I needed.

2018-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,23650892,Kate,"We attempted to stay here on business trip to Sydney. The apartment was not at all what we expected, there were blood stains on the sheets, hair left in the sink, grim on the shower floor and the toilets were dirty. Naveen was very unprofessional in her response to this and we ended up leaving because we felt very uncomfortable."
2014-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Georg,"We really enjoyed our time at Davids House. It is perfectly located - very close to transport, Cafés, Shops and you can easily reach a lot of sights by relatively Short walks (Opera House, Harbour Bridge, Darling Harbour, ...)

The House/Room is very clean and Looks exactly like the pictures. Very nice room with balcony, TV, comfortable Bed and a Lot of Space to store your belongings. The bathroom also is very clean and Even bigger than expected.

David is very nice and helpfull - he can help you Out in almost every Situation. David even created a booklet, which recommends some nice Bars, Restaurants and Breakfast-Offers.

Thanks for everything, David. We really enjoyed staying with you/at your beautiful place.

We can totally recommend David and his House/Room"
2018-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,8797439,Dave,If the property still has a king sized bed and a queen sized bed in the description and this is important to you then you may wish to get an explicitly acknowledgement that this is the size of the beds at the property as when we stayed the sizes were double and double.
2016-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,6170899,Philippa,Jennifer met us at the house when we arrived and made us feel at home. The house looked just as we had viewed on the website and fulfilled our expectations. We loved the private outdoor area.
2015-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Anne,"J ai passé trois jours très agréables dans le studio du jardin de Susan. C est un studio très confortable, très pratique dans lequel on se sent comme chez soi.

2014-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Megan,"Had a wonderful time at Jeremy's house. The kids especially loved the stairs and the loft bedroom.  The views from the balconies a must see. 

Located very close to Sydney cbd. Local buses just a street away, 5 minute dawdle. It is possible to walk into / from the city which we found after the bus left us behind and no taxi would take us because they didn't have a baby seat. 

We were a family group of 7 so we caught a mini bus from the airport which cost us approx $60. Soo much easier than catching then train and walking with 7 + bags. 

Would love to stay again. "
2018-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Paul,One of the best apartments within the 3 apartment buildings around Olympic Park. Ticks all the boxes.
2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,20962081,Paul,The massage chair is fantastic and the location couldn't be better.  As I said the only thing I would change would be the towels.

I would reiterate the point about the stairs being very steep and perhaps unsuitable for very young children or people with mobility issues. Other than that, I would highly recommend!"
2017-07-19T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,Lisa,"This is a beautiful comfortable home, within easy walking distance of a gorgeous beach, the famous aboriginal carvings, ferry to Cronulla, shops and cafes.

The photos don’t do the place justice - very spacious for 2 people, well decorated and the leafy views from the balcony make you feel you’re far, far away from Sydney! 5 min drive to Avalon Beach and shops, so very handy. Justine also supplies bread, milk, cereal and fruit for brekkie, which is a lovely touch."

2017-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Kimberley,"Michele was a fantastic host and always willing to help out with requests! The place itself is exactly as pictured, if not better as the sofa bed has been upgraded to a real bed. It is clean and the kitchenette is well stocked. Would definitely recommend staying here to my friends and would consider staying here again next time. It is a short 10min walk to Newtown station which is a few stops from the city centre which is really convenient. "
2015-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Dave,"Great experience. Really nice room, really convenient for what I needed. Hernan is a good guy, made my stay very comfortable and got on with our own thing. Definitely recommend staying."
2014-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Chelsey,"This room and apartment are a great little find - in a lovely quiet area in Rozelle with great transport links into the city via bus and walking distance to some awesome pubs & into Balmain. You could also walk into the CBD in 40 mins (which we did a few times across the Anzac Bridge).
We stayed with Duncan and Ashlee for three weeks and they are perfect hosts - gave us space to do our own thing but always there if we needed advice on Sydney (it was our first time to the city) and generally great company.
The room itself is spacious and well furnished with plenty of space for storage, the bed was really comfy with an electric blanket for when the nights got a little chilly, and Duncan's information sheet in the bedroom was a great reference point. Kitchen, Living Room and Bathroom are ample sized and well equipped. There is nothing I can fault this property on nor the hosts - a great first experience of Airbnb and Sydney for us. Thank you so much guys!"

Although the house a little bit far away from wolli creek station, it still a good choice to stay in shuang's house as it is located in a quiet neighbour . It takes around 5 mins walk to get to the supermarket to get what all you need. Thank you Shuang and your mum! I will defintely stay in your place again in the near future ! Cheers!"

2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,20962081,Thu,"The apartment had an outstanding location. It is very closed to World Square with shops and Coles supermarket. It is closed to train stations as well (Town Hall station and Museum station). The house is very clean when we checked in. It has everything that we need. The host is very careful, actively contacted me for the check in, check out, and when I asked. Very quick response. 
My family love the massage chair. It works well. 
Just 1 small thing is about the bathrooms. The glass doors cannot be shut properly so water comes out to the floor while showering."

2016-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,5993432,Georgia,"Hugo's place was lovely! Exactly as he described and a great size for the two of us. It's far enough out of the city so you don't have the noise and traffic but still in close enough distance to public transport, supermarkets, and tourist attractions. It's also an easy walking distance to the city which we loved. I would highly recommend this place to people who are planning on getting out of their accommodation and exploring Sydney because for me it was a small space to be in for long periods of time. Having said that though, it was very liveable and comfortable! Thanks again to Hugo, and thanks to Oliver for being very hospitable on our arrival. "
2017-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Trudy,Had a lovely stay at Millie's.  Only a 15-20 minute walk to Circular Quay over the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  Very convenient.  Many thanks
2017-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Sheila,Shuang's place is ideal for a layover in Sydney.  It is within walking distance to the international terminal at the airport as well as close to shopping and transit. Very clean unit and comfortable bed.

Cathy was a great host, and even picked us up from the nearest bus stop on our arrival! There are plenty of beaches, shops and restaurants around. Great place!"
2017-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Sebastian,"Let's be clear - this is an incredible space. The Airbnb is bigger than it appears in the pictures, and the views far more stunning. The neighborhood is also so charming and underrated - so many excellent cafes and restaurants, and yet still so quiet. You will not find a better Airbnb in Sydney for this value - period. Jeremy was also a delight to facilitate this process - organized, quickly responsive, and willing to go that extra bit to accommodate your needs. Being a frequent Airbnb host myself, I was so impressed. 

I would recommend this property to anyone I know visiting Sydney, and can't wait to hopefully stay here again! Thanks again, Jeremy!"
2018-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,21637487,Ella,"Hands down the cutest little secret spot in Bondi!!

2018-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,22124796,Jade,The most beautiful apartment. Such a nice pool and good gym. Very happy i choose this place.
2015-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Jennifer,"Susan and Greg are some of the most caring, welcoming and thoughtful hosts I have met. Their studio is the perfect place to stay near Bronte beach - light, airy, very clean and well appointed with a super comfortable bed, roomy bathroom and the comforts of home. I awoke every morning to the sound of birds and an ocean breeze, and loved relaxing in the beautiful garden space which they have lovingly created. It offers the quintessential Bronte neighborhood experience - 10 mins stroll to the beach, close to the best restaurants and is located in a lovely street full of native flora.

But what makes this home really special are the hosts' thoughtful gestures - everything from the breakfast items they left me, through to local tips and suggestions, as well as an invitation to join them for festive celebrations. They are both natural hosts - available if you need assistance but also offer guests privacy and personal space.

This is the perfect place to stay at one of Sydney's best beaches (as a single or couple). I look forward to enjoying Susan and Greg's hospitality and friendship again very soon!"
2016-10-23T04:00:00.000Z,4499095,Beatriz,"Tengo que poner un 10 al apartamento, a la zona y a Dino. Todo han sido facilidades y la comunicación abierta en todo momento. El apartamento tiene de todo. DE TODO. Es muy cómodo, con mucha luz que le hace muy agradable y la decoración y el cuidado con que están escogidos los detalles le dan aún más valor. La zona me ha encantado también. A unos 10-15 minutos de una estación de tren y el autobus al lado del edificio. Lo recomiendo sin ninguna duda. No tiene ninguna pega."

I highly recommend this place, it's great. I'm looking forward to returning soon."

2016-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,7503081,Nachum,"We (myself and 2 of my young sons) stayed a week at George's. All good. Place was very clean and tidy when we arrived at around 9am. The place is small but sufficient for our needs, as we spent most of our time out-and-about. Great location, just a 2 minute walk to Bondi Road.

If you rent a car then plan to spend 5 minutes looking for a parking place along Penkivil St, and perhaps walk a few hundred yards to the building. We had no problems parking in the building's driveway to load/unload luggage.

I met George just once during the stay, when we locked ourselves out. He immediately responded to my message and I went to get spares from him. Worked out fine and we lost only the time it took me to drive to his work and back - around a half hour.

All my communications with George were very quick. Everything he told us was true and I would recommend staying at his place. Enjoy!"
2018-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Shanti & Lauren,"Simone’s place was fantastic! We stayed for 4 nights with 3 adults, two babies and two kids and there was plenty of room for all of us. Simone left us a portacot and high chair, both of which were very useful. 
The location was fantastic, we walked, and on occasion took the bus, to the beach. And the proximity to The Spot was great for dinners and early breakfast at the bakery!
We would definitely stay here again."
2016-12-12T05:00:00.000Z,12655535,Tan,Very friendly and helpful.
2016-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,13299549,Bill,"Five star location right in the heart of the CBD. Clean, convenient and great value. Will book again."

2017-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Maria,"Nataša is a perfect host offering a cozy, clean and comfortable place to stay."
2017-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Ashradha,Great location and accommodating hosts!
2016-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,10213499,Nicholas,Tracy and her husband were very welcoming and the room was very comfortable.
2018-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,16408272,Tyler,Chloe was a ray of sunshine and went out of her way to meet us early.
2018-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,13333143,Elle,"Ziggy's apartment was exactly as described/represented in the pictures. Ziggy was very easy to deal with and he was very accomodating when we needed to make an amendment to our booking. The apartment was modern and very clean and the location was extremely convenient. 2min walk to the beach, 5min to the wharf and surrounded by shops. I would highly recommend this listing for a couple wanting to stay in Manly."
2017-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Margo,Fantastic value and so central. Chole is a great host and very accommodating and great communicator. Will definitely stay again.
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Vern,"What a fantastic apartment right next to Central Station. This opens up the entire city to you through the trains, buses and light rail. Use the Opal card to save on costs. The living room is well laid out and the couch is well built and comfortable. The TV is run through the Internet so there are many options to chose from. The closest market is downstairs and a small Woolworth a block away. The unit is in a secure building and on the top floor for great views. If you like trains, you will love it more! The kitchen has everything to make your own meals, which we did. When we arrived Alexey and Olga had a lovely bottle of wine waiting for us. Very thoughtful and considerate host. The bed was very comfortable. We used the downstairs bathroom with the large tub and shower, so convenient. The stairs are easily manageable but not for wheelchair users. The bathroom upstairs has a shower and the washer and dryer. That is such a plus for travelers. I would say we were able to enjoy our week in Sydney so much more because we rented this apartment. This is the very best value to be found and we're thankful we booked it. Highly recommend and would book it again if in Sydney."
2017-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,Sarah,"Anita and Peter are fantastic hosts. The apartment was beautifully decorated and immaculate. Beds are exceptionally comfortable. The location in Manly was perfect, you can see the beach from the balcony, less than 10min stroll to the corso, and less than 20min to Manly Wharf. Loved our stay here and wish we could have moved in permanently! "
2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Aaron,Rhonda was very friendly and helpful.
2015-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Vivienne,"Everything is more than satisfied and amazing in Naveen and Tristan' s apartment! Me and my sister have spent three nights in their lovely home, they have prepared everything we need in our specious room as well as the private bathroom. We enjoy all the details and atmosphere, it is exactly looks the same as the photos.
The gym and swimming pool just 3 seconds from home, super convenient. There are lots of designable café and bar on the street nearby, train station just 5mins walk.
It definitely is the best choice for everyone who have a plan to stay in Sydney. Highly recommended."
2016-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Licia,"Naveen's place was clean and nice, conviently located near the train station. Naveen and Tristan were lovely hosts and their dog, Felix, is a delight too. Great stay!"

2018-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,26785847,Caitlin,"We loved staying in this cosy flat, it’s so charming and it felt like home right away. The location is great – close to all the action but on a quiet street and everything just felt fun and easy. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us! "
2018-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,22295401,Arne Philipp,"Nice, stylish apartment with a comfortable bed! Easy communication. Area is a bit rough, former red light district, but house felt really safe."

2015-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Vesa,"The location is absolutely perfect!

Other great things about this place:
> The shower had excellent water pressure

> The location was perfect for easy access to the beach and to coastal morning runs. 
> The kitchen was well stocked with all the equipment one needed.
> The bed was very comfortable, and we enjoyed waking up to the sound of waves.

2017-06-19T04:00:00.000Z,16070079,Nicholas,I highly recommend Gregoire's place in Sydney it's the perfect size for a couple staying in Sydney. Very close to the city cbd with Museum station around the corner to take you anywhere. Lost of nice bars and coffee shops around the corner. Great host that is very prepared with a house manual presenting all transport options and places to stay and eat. We had a fantastic time.
2018-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,19508741,Jane,Great place - everything we needed. Would recommend.

2017-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,6201263,Kate,"I had a fantastic stay at The Yoco House. Big thanks to everyone for making me feel welcome. Communication and check in was easy. The room is large with a comfortable bed, WiFi is good and kitchen is well equipped. I had a car and could park it on the street on the weekend for free. Lots of good cafes and restaurants to explore in the surrounding streets."
2015-03-27T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Jodie,"Its neighbourhoods like this that make me want to move to Sydney! The location was perfect, being between the city and Bondi with a great variety up-market of shops and boutiques. Arnie and his wife are both intelligent and friendly. I stumbled to make eye contact with them at times because I trying to take in the collective of interesting artworks. My only regret is that I didn't book another night. Thanks for having me. I would love to stay again."
2017-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Matt,Perfect stay!

2015-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,6785160,Janice,"I can highly recommend Carole and Steve’s place  - what a lovely, light, spacious and spotlessly clean home! If you get a chance to rent the entire house, go for it. We stayed in the front two rooms of the house, in our own fairly separate area, and had sole use of a beautiful, spacious bathroom.  There are no kitchen facilities in this part of the house (as made clear in the ad) but there is a small fridge, kettle and toaster, as well as cutlery and crockery for guests to use. Meals are easy to find in any case as the house is close to some fantastic cafes, bars, pubs and restaurants – a real taste of Sydney’s cosmopolitan inner west. The house is in a peaceful, quiet, tree-lined street. Parking, if you need it, is easy to find nearby, or even out the front if you're lucky (check the parking signs to be sure though). Public transport – buses, trains –  in easy walking distance. Carole and Steve and Snoop dog were perfect AirBnB hosts, very friendly and considerate, without being intrusive. We were lucky to have found them! Absolutely recommended. "
2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,21851474,Max,"A great place, clean, stylish and convenient. The bird sound in the early morning may be a nuisance to somebody want to get up late."
2016-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,13689460,Minako,"Irresponsible lowest host.
""We will now be away for the weekend so unfortunately will not get to meet you! ""
She sent me this message the day before the afternoon of check-in date, no sorry, no apology, nothing. When the day before I made a final confirmation about check-in, she did not mention anything, I don't know why. I didn't check my e-mail after leaving my home, so I first realized this after arriving at her house. I felt very uneasy, I had to find all things myself.
If you need to get away from home, okay, but you should let the guest know at least a few days ago, you are too irresponsible.
Also where was ""Nutribullet and breakfast essentials""? I didn't see anything, I had only tea and coffee.
Also, I left the house before the checkout time, but after that I got a message about checkout.
Lowest host.

2013-11-05T05:00:00.000Z,794910,Joel,We had a nice stay in Sydney. The room was no frills which suited us fine and we had a great chat with Gavin. We recommend staying here if you are looking for a simple room with good company.

The most important is that the location is very closed to stations and you also can easy walk to city. It is also a safe location too. Just good for 3 of us to stay in. We are enjoy the stay there.

In the months leading up to our booking Jason made himself available to assist us with any questions or queries we had about our time in the house.

Jason was flexible with our schedule and did everything he could to make our stay as perfect and problem free as it could be.
The home is immaculately kept and in great condition.  Close to public transport and near by shops. 

By the end of the two weeks, Jason's home felt like home to our cast and crew. Both Jason and his partner are so welcoming and accomodating - We have now become great friends!!"

The house and location are absolutely superb and it was one of the nicest places we have ever stayed. Special mention has to go for the bed, which was something out of heaven, the comfiest thing we have ever experienced in our entire lives! Thank you so much for such a lovely stay."

Really appreciate it ."
2019-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,23510317,Anne,Great place in a perfect location. Exactly as described. Spacious and cute decor. Would recommend staying here. Just two things that were not perfect: The wifi was too slow to use and the aircon unit is a big mobile unit but requires the window to be open which on a hot day does not quite work. Other than that a beautiful apartment to explore Sydney.
2019-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,25410221,Salome,"Thea’s place was perfectly located. A great space which was well maintained and exceptionally clean. Thea was an excellent communicator and was in touch very promptly to reply to all of my questions. Staying there during summer, the studio was very cool during the day. It is well located close to public transport and major shopping centres. There are many great cafes in the area, and a very welcoming and diverse neighborhood. Definitely good value for money."
2018-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Neil,"I was greeted by a lovely warm welcoming smile, the price the location he huge private granny flat and the wildlife nestled background :)"
2017-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,19574869,Juliana,"Ruby is an excellent host, but the photos don't show with accuracy all spaces. A lot of dust everywhere and a little bit dirty in the balcony. The building is in remodelation process and there is an scaffold in the main access and block the view as well. We didn't be warned in that issue."

2018-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,22378312,Jon,Great location only few minutes from Kings Cross station yet quiet and peaceful. Coffee shop few doors up the street is also worthwhile.
2019-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,27555785,Jenna,Cy was an amazing host who was super understanding when our flight was delayed and we couldn’t check in till 4pm. The location of the place was outstanding with it only being a 10min walk to darling harbour and a 10 minute train ride into the CBD! 10/10 would recommend and stay again!
2016-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,8121226,Lisa,Jenny could not have been more accommodating or helpful.  The apartment was even nicer than the photos suggest.  Everything has been finished to a very high standard.  The area is vibrant and convenient.
2018-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,13595339,Vicky,"Mariana is a lovely host, easy to get a hold of and happy to help out if you need anything. Having never been to Sydney before I wasn’t sure what was a good area to stay in. I was so happy with the location - Woolworths just across the road, 30 mins walk to circular quay, lots of lovely restaurants and cafes and I didn’t feel worried walking around at night alone so can’t ask for better! 
The flat was lovely. Really clean and tidy with a heater and fans so easy to keep warm or cool depending on the weather. Fantastic rain shower as well! 
I stayed here for a little over a month and the only thing I missed was having an oven. There’s a microwave and hobs so easy to manage without. 
Mariana had fly screens in place to keep the room ventilated which was lovely but it was very noisy the first night where we could hear the next door neighbours conversations and music! No problem to take some of them down and no problems with noise once we could close the windows. 
The internet did drop in and out a little in the evenings but always sorted itself out so again not really a problem. 
All in all it is a really lovely flat where I felt safe and comfortable in a new city on the other side of the world! Mariana was a great host and I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again.  "
2018-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Katy,"I booked this AirBnB for my parents who were visiting me nearby. The place is lovely, spacious and well appointed, and not far from the bustling Dulwich Hill shops. The bed was very comfortable and my parents enjoyed their stay here."
2019-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,22295401,Fay,"Extremely well-located, Griffin’s place is ideal for either lone travellers or a couple. Also to note the area felt safe and the studio apartment was beautifully decorated and the bed extremely comfortable and the place very clean. Would recommend!"
2017-07-14T04:00:00.000Z,12370710,Debbie,Perfect location at Manly with a stunning view.  An easy stroll to Manly and the wharf with breathtaking views along the way.  Maria and Jerry were charming and friendly and willing to share their knowledge of the local area.  So much to see on the beach side of Sydney and away from the crowds of the city.  Highly recommend.
2017-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,18338274,Anthony,Beautiful period house. Very spacious and tidy. Amazing location so close to transport and city. Made to feel very welcome by our host. An absolute pleasure. Would choose to stay here again.

2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Leonor,"The place is perfect if you have to pick up an early flight. Just like 10 minutes drive from/to the airport, both international & domestic terminals, a taxi is around $24. They have all you need and the place is pretty independent."
2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Kathryn,"Wonderful location,  but on an unexpectedly noisy street, so take ear plugs for sleeping!

2016-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,13299549,Rachel,We really enjoyed our stay at the apartment. The location was fantastic and made getting around in Sydney very easy. We have very young children who were waking very early due to the light in the bedrooms (thin blinds) but otherwise it was great.
2016-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Chrissie,Susan has a caring and lovely character. I will give her 10 stars or even more for the service and everything provided.

2017-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,16087198,George,"The hosts are definitely nice people, and have taken great care of me over the 19days that I stayed with the family. Both Auntie Yang and her husband are great people, who often asked me if I had my dinner, and invited me when they have their family dinner. Really thoughful of them. The house is big, and the room is clean! Hope to be back again!"
2016-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Margaret,"We had a great time staying with Naveen and Tristan. Their place is in a great location to eat or drink in Darlinghurst or to explore the city.

2018-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Paul,This was perfect for me. I loved the Bluetooth speaker so I could access all my audio on my iPhone. Strawberries in the fridge. Air conditioning was great on the cold night.
2018-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,21127680,Jason,"The apartment is in a good area with lots of good Thai and Chinese restaurants and about a 10 minute walk to the Central Station. The flat is rather basic and a bit dated and could use a bit of renovations and a deep cleaning. The kitchen amenities are sparse and not really adequate for a long term stay. The bed was comfortable, but the sofa was not. We were there for only 5 days which was OK. It is pretty much as advertised, but nothing really special. It was reasonably priced for what it was. 
Thanks Coffee"
2018-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Jacki,"Great location, terrific facilities and so helpful with our requirements. Just a high five all round ! "
2019-01-24T05:00:00.000Z,17829178,Debbie,"Elise was quick to reply and helpful with any questions we had! Beautiful and clean place, short walk to shops and take away places. Very kid friendly and fitted all our needs as a family of 5 :)"
2018-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,24863216,Amanda,Great comfortable bed and great touches such as a beach bag and towels! The studio is very modern and has a great shower also. The keyless entry was very easy to use and made the check in process very stress free. Would stay again.
2019-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,21939239,Nikhil,"Don's place is in a fantastic location in surry hills. Close to the best cafes and restaurants Sydney has to offer. The apartment is spacious, clean and has all the amenties for a comfortable stay in Sydney"
2017-04-20T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Nicholas,Great location with full facilities
2019-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Jaci,Nice place very convenient to the airport.
2017-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,20906942,April,Excellent location in a quiet leafy suburb. Within walking distance to many good eateries and shops. Great place for exploring Sydney.
2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,16885508,Jaselle,We had a wonderful stay at Ruth’s home! It felt like arriving in a resort and was so wonderful to be able to live in the house as though it was our own. The bed in the main bedroom was amazingly comfortable!
2018-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Johann,Fantastic place has a base camp for Western Sydney however it is more suitable for business trips or for short stays due to the limit space. House is located in an ideal spot close to major highways and local shopping centre but nested inside the suburbs so you escape the noise pollution.
2016-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,15960997,Allison,"Terry's place has a beautiful view of the city and was easy to get to and from throughout the day. It was a bit difficult for Uber drivers to find us, but using the hotel across the street as a pick-up spot fixed that problem easily!"
2017-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Smita,Nice place
2016-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,2900140,Deb,Great as it was previously thank you
2018-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Nicole,Highly recommend MissD's place. My stay was incredibly enjoyable with no drama or confusion. Hands down the most comfortable AirBnB bed I've ever slept in.
2016-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,6170899,Clare,"Stayed for 3 nights in Jennifer's beautiful Balmain terrace. The kitchen was well stocked. We had a great stay in this beautiful house, no issues at all. I would note that the stairs are steep, which is typical for this type of house. If you have small children  staying (as we had) or people with mobility issues, you would need to take extra care. "
2018-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,18130053,MinJung,The house was really nice and spacious. I liked the two storied house. Two bathrooms were clean and nice. The location was also very nice but little bit noisy at night
2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Rizwan,Stunning home in a great location
2016-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Dorine,"We had a great time at David place in Pott's Point. The location was very good, we could do a lot of things walking from here. The place itself was fine, nice and clean, only the noises from the street were a little bit disturbing."
2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Solange,Apartment was great. Very well equipped. Great stay.
2015-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Michaeli,Really lovely home and cosy seperate cabin in backyard with own bathroom. Very easy to find and parking was good. I love this part of Sydney and Susan was very friendly and easy to talk with. Offer of a lovely breakfast but I went down the road to a lovely little square with a few cafes. Friendly and easy stay.
2015-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Andrew,"The apartment was very clean and had everything i required for a short stay. Bed was a great size and very comfortable. Really liked the couch, great for relaxing on. Excellent sound system. Louise was very helpful. Everything was as shown in pictures if not better. "
2014-03-29T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Jacinth,"The studio was really lovely. It was very clean, well equipped and pretty spacious. Everything was as how it looks in the pictures. We liked how the studio was designed, it gave us a very comfortable homely feel. Cath was patient and helpful with our questions, and she gave us our privacy, only popped in to give us some baked goodies and fresh towels. Overall we enjoyed our stay there and we would definitely recommend it to our friends."
2018-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Yousuf,Great location and very responsive host. Highly recommend.
2017-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Meg,Great location - close to pretty much anything you could need.
2017-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Alexandria,Mal's apartment was great and he was a helpful and responsive host. The apartment was as described and right on the beach and public transport straight across the street. Close proximity to great bars and restaurants. We had a really wonderful time. I'd suggest if someone is sleeping in the sun room that you pack a sleeping mask as the street lights are a little bright. Would 100% recommend this place to stay. Will be back!
2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Celine,"This apartment is very well equiped and easy to live. There is one detail we did appreciate: there are USB plugs available! It may be a detail but we’re French and we need adaptors for all our devices. With USB plugs things were easier for us. 
This shows the nice attitude towards people who stay at this apartment. 
It is very well located also. Close to bars, restaurants and food shops. 
We loved staying there. 
And on the top of that we loved meeting Ollie we were talking with. He was here to warmly welcome us when we arrived. He was very reactive with messages and helped us with information about things to do (special thanks for the markets Ollie ). He also booked a taxi for us. 
And we had conversations through Airbnb chat about our days. That was so nice! Thank you very much Ollie "
2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Edisson,"Cathy's place was a great choice. It is well located, not far from public transport, sparkling clean and quite cozy.
She gave us quite a few tips on how to get around as well as to what to do and see.
The breakfast provided is good an simple.
Even though it is rightly described as  pint sized we felt comfortable and didn't miss anything. 
Cathy was happy to help whenever we need it.

Great value for money. Highly recommended."
2017-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Yuyue,"Thank you !!!Thank you for your patience, thank you for providing us with such a warm environment!!"
2016-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Julie-Ann,"Simon and Nicole's apartment was an absolute delight! 
It is very conveniently located near the Central train station stop-which is the perfect place to be if you are going to the Blue Mountains, beaches, anywhere really- from Sydney. This stop is only minutes from Circle Quay which is the stop for the wharf and all ferry transfers, the Rocks, Sydney Opera House, etc. With the Central Station so near we felt truly like we were in the perfect location.
The apartment itself is very clean, cozy, and has everything you need to feel right at home. Kitchen is well stocked with necessary items for  light cooking, but there are also many cafés and coffee houses near by. Staying here made us feel like we had a home ( or at least an apartment) away from home right in Sydney. 
We would definitely stay there again on future visits to this beautiful city!
It was an absolute perfect place for us to stay on our first visit to Sydney! We would highly recommend this apartment to anyone!
"
2018-06-22T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Adam,Great location and a lovely apartment with fantastic views. Recommend staying here
2017-06-19T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Dee,"I booked this room because my flight was in the morning and Shuang's house is super close to the Sydney airport. All full stars, pretty clean, tidy, quiet! Good mattress hotel level bed sheet set. Even the shampoo and body wash product are of good  quality. The room is as  good as the picture shows."
2018-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,21568012,Frieda,"Good value for money, would rent again"
2018-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Brian,"Michele was very helpful host who communicated well. The room was very comfortable for our couple. It is located near Newtown stn, 10 mins walking distance. Would stay here again!"
2016-08-07T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,Kaushik,"I had a very comfortable stay here. Kath is a great host, and her dog Ruski is very friendly. The room was clean, and the place is very close to a train station (just one stop to the city center). The neighborhood is a bit quiet with not many people around, but doesn't feel unsafe. Thanks Kath!"
2016-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Amy,Cath has really thought of everything to make your stay comfortable.  The amenities in the apartment are above and beyond anything I expected.  We had a lovely stay and would certainly return.
2018-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,25977467,Kirri,"We stayed here overnight to go to a concert and the apartment couldn’t have been more perfect for what we needed. Ideally located, secure, private, superbly maintained, and easy for a visitor to navigate. The sofa bed was prepared for our arrival as requested. There were towels and sheets from previous guests on a rack in the lounge room, but they were kept out of the way and didn’t intrude on our enjoyment of the apartment at all. Thank you very much, we highly recommend it."
2017-10-23T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Leni,"Mohit and his fiancée, Priya were very friendly and welcoming. My relatives who stayed at their apartment to attend my daughter's wedding were very happy with everything. Although they couldn't find the password for the wifi but it didn't bother them because they were out most the time anyway. I could've contacted him and asked him about the password but I was so busy myself with my other relatives so I am very happy that my relatives were happy too. The location was very ideal for people who want to go sightseeing around the city area or to go to train station and bus stop. It's very closed to The Grounds of Alexandria where my daughter's wedding reception was. I can highly recommend their apartment and him and Priya who were very professional, friendly and approachable.

Mohit and Priya, thank you very much for being amazing hosts and kindness and everything.

I can only say nice things about the apartment and the hosts. It's very easy to communicate with them too."
2016-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Suchada,"We were so happy with Cath's Garden Studio. Everything was clean and looked just like the photos. We felt very comfortable, safe, and right at home. Cath was so sweet to bring us fresh eggs, fresh bread and warm croissants in the morning. She was very kind and helpful whenever we had questions. The fresh towels smelled so good and the bed was super comfortable (we didn't want to get out of bed!) This space is perfect for one or two people. Thank you, Cath!!! :)"
2019-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Luke,"This place is amazing. Perfect location and great modern facilities. Phillip is a great host, quick response and friendly. Would stay here again for sure."

2018-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,16234640,Manling,great location and great view from the apartment
2015-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,FrankVee,"Very enjoyable and warm reception.  The unit has automatic booking, so Arnie was unaware of us coming, thus we only gained access around 3:30.  Thus, suggest you call ahead to ensure all are aware.

Lovely interesting house, I will attempt to return on my next visit."
2018-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,22124796,Melissa,A great to stay! Highly recommended!
2017-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,James,"A lovely cottage room and ensuite in the heart of beautiful Newtown. Close to the shopping strip, 10 minutes from buses and trains, and Michele is lovely!"
2018-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Tammy,"The place was perfect for our family, a good place to stay while visiting nearby family. Lina was great to deal with. We'd come back next time."
2015-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Linda,"We arrived early from interstate and the apartment was ready for us, Fred was on hand to explain everything and give us some tips on catching the bus.   The apartment was exactly as described and the location was fabulous.  The beach and sea pool were much utilised as the temperature climbed to 42 degrees, even beach towels were provided, in fact we had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay.  Although we travelled to Sydney to see the touristy sites, we found it hard to leave Malabar, the cafe a few minutes up the street and the golf club restaurant meant easy access to good quality meals and coffee.  A thoroughly enjoyable stay, thanks Fred and Bernadette "
2018-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Nada,Nice space and easy enough to get to. The coffee machine and selection of teas was a lovely touch.

2017-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,16234640,Annie,Perfect location. We really like the view from the apt exactly what u c in the pictures. The surrounding was nice with pathways to the ferry wharf n nearby park. We saw people running up n down the hills right in front of the apt. Parking is easy.
2018-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Paul,"Had a a great stay, the location is perfect. Quick response to emails."
2018-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Joselito,Great location near the harbour. Great value
2017-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,16234640,Anita,"This is a great spot to stay as a launch into all directions of the greater Sydney area!  
All public transport options are available very close by, we took the ferry into the city, it was a really nice trip and if you don't have an Opal card, it's very quick and easy to buy one at the convenience store downstairs.
The floor to ceiling windows are pretty amazing and the breeze that comes through at that height was all we needed to keep the apartment at a comfortable temperature. The sunset view is beautiful.
The estate has other buildings and common areas being worked on, but it doesn't effect your stay - just great for people watching when you sit at the dining table! :)  There's a convenience store downstairs, there's an IGA about a 2 minute walk away, as well as a coffee place, medical centre, chemist, vet, nail bar and more that looks to open soon!  Then in the other direction, in the same estate, not sure how long it would take to walk (maybe about 5-10 minutes), but there's a few restaurants there.  You could also walk over the pedestrian bridge to a large shopping centre in Rhodes, it has everything you need there!
The hosts were lovely, while we didn't need to call on them during our stay, they seem like they'd do anything to try and help make your stay the best possible."
2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,20055551,Mason,Thanks Adrian and Rhys for an awesome stay! I loved the location - very close to public transport and a 15/20 minute walk to Sydney Opera House. Both guys were super friendly and offered recommendations for the area.
2018-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Leo,"One of the best location. infront of central train station. this place have everything you need. quick to response to inquiry. and going over and beyond with the personal touch of a welcome wine . If you are looking for a place to stay, do not hesitate to book this awesome apt. great place and great host!"
2018-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,24460964,Hung,It’s an amazing apartment! The couch turns into a sofa bed and there’s air conditioners on the roof. I would recommend this apartment to many people!

May good times continue, THANKS Hernan"

2018-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Moritz,Our stay in Sydney in Victoria's apartment was great. It is nicely and conveniently located in the beautiful Elizabeth Bay area. Public transport can be reached easily and even a walk to the Opera House is easily possible. The apartment is small but equipped with everything that two people need. Even breakfast and coffee was there. We would stay here again!
2017-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Matthew,"Chloe was really helpful with check in and check out on a busy public holiday weekend. The apartment really worked for us. 2 couples with 2 toddlers under 2. There is enough room in both bedrooms for a travel cot and all your luggage. Really central location. It is right at Wynyard station and is a 5 minute walk to Circular Quay, 7 minutes to Barangaroo, 10 minutes to Pitt St mall and a 20-25 minute walk to darling harbour. Plenty of parking around (Sydney CBD prices)."
2014-11-04T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Anna,Marcella is a welcoming host providing all the details that we needed about the house and the place.  It was close to the beach and shops and just a 15-20 minutes drive to the city.

It is a part of a complex where other air bnb people rent, and some of the guests were noisy, especially late at night. The walls were super thin. Very comfy bed and big window that allows fresh air in all night!"

2014-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Sarah,"You can't really beat Belinda's place in terms of location and experience. I had a friend visiting from overseas and we had a lovely time in this little laid back beach town. Belinda's place is a cute little place where you can hear the birds sing in the morning and the waves crashing on the shores as you sleep. 

Just lovely and I couldn't be more happy to recommend it to anyone looking to get out of Sydney for a few days! "

2018-11-07T05:00:00.000Z,16166535,Suzanne,I couldn't be happier with Fei's place.  We arrived earlier than expected and Fei's father showed us around. Fei arrived and welcomed us.  Fei's son opened a bottle of wine and  cut up a mango. He chatted with us.  We had separate sleeping rooms and our own refrigerator.  Groceries and pub within walking distance.  Very safe neighborhood.  Fei even gave my travel partner some tea to take home with him.  I highly recommend staying here.
2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,17028088,Erin,"I really enjoyed my stay. The apartment had lots of space, was very clean and was beautifully decorated. I would definitely stay here again."

2016-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Sion,"Needed a place to stay just for the night close to the airport, only $14 taxi ride. Perfect just for the one night quick stay, really clean and comfortable."
2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,20865085,Katie,"Jenny was a gracious host. She made sure we had everything that we needed. She even left some bread, butter and jams. The house was stocked with milk and tea as well. Very comfortable bed. Clean spacious living area. Beautiful view. The experience was wonderful. I would definitely stay there again."

Now with a microwave - thanks Hugo!"
2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,19376053,Joe,"We found it a great location for exploring Sydney, right next to central station. We thought it could use a little TLC to fix a few little things, and found the main bedroom a bit noisy from the traffic at night. Andrew was very easy to communicate with throughout. No major issues overall but felt the photos made the flat appear better than it was in person."
2017-04-27T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Phil,Perfect place to stay. Lovely apartment - highly recommended. Extremely helpful and responsive hosts.
2018-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,28231022,Jackie,Great place. A bit noisy when a train goes pass
2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Cole,"The location is absolutely incredible! We were able to walk to a number of coffee shops and eateries right below the apartment and hop on the train just two minutes away to get anywhere else! The apartment was exactly what we were hoping for as far as location! The apartment is old and it's in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) it's a bit dirty and loud at night! All in all, it was exactly what we were looking for, just didn't expect to be woken up so often throughout the night! :)"
2018-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,22308786,梓宜,"Perfect, very clean, suitable for family live, kitchen have all things needed. Beach is very closed, woolworths is about 7 min walk. Our family like this house very much."
2018-03-12T04:00:00.000Z,23312848,Vanessa,Great location and great house! Richard was a very relaxed host and made us feel at home. We had use of the pool which made our stay even more special. Would definitely recommend.
2018-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,21127680,Juliette,Great place to stay in central Sydney. Loved our stay!
2014-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Steve,The perfect location.  Close to bus and rail stops. Many local resturaunts. Jeremy is very responsive to any issue and responsibly accommodates his guests. He communicates quickly and is any amazing guy. The Gracious Darlinghurst  Terrace accommodates up to 8 people comfortably. All bedrooms are upstairs and the City lights view is worth every step. Thanks Jeremy. We will definite return for our next visit to Sydney.
2016-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,1979960,Astrid,"We had a good time at this place. The location is perfect for a visit to Sydney - all major sights are more or less in walking distance. Jeremy was very helpful and accessible, and he responded immediately in case of concerns or problems. The house is very spacious and easily accommodates a group the size of ours (8 adults), it just could do with some TLC. We had the 'Big Wet' (non-stop rain for four days in a row!) so unfortunately we could not enjoy the decks and balconies. "
2015-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Samantha,"Simon and Nicole were wonderful hosts. Very polite and helpful. Their place was very clean,spotles, close to transport and in walking distance to cafe and restaurants. I would recommend this place to my family and friends. Thankyou for having us there."

2015-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Marion,"MissD's Appartement ist sehr schön und zentral gelegen und alles war so, wie auf den Bildern gezeigt und wie es beschrieben wurde. Erwähnen sollte man jedoch für lärmempfindliche Menschen die Einflugschneise des Flughafens direkt über dem Appartement. Wenn man länger als eine Nacht dort bleibt, sollte man sich eventuell überlegen, ob man sich nicht etwas Ruhigeres suchen sollte.
MissD ist sehr hilfsbereit und jederzeit schnell zu erreichen, egal, um welche Frage es sich handelte. Auch die Informationen, die im Zimmer aushängen, sind sehr hilfreich. "
2016-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Kerrie,"Our stay in Philip's house was excellent.  We were welcomed by Oliver who was very responsive to every request we subsequently had.  The location is great, just 5 mins walk from Hyde Park and the CBD.  The house is very cool, with multiple levels and is well equipped.  Would definitely stay again if in Sydney with the family."
2018-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Sarah,"Loved staying at Narelle's place. The location is unbeatable, the triple glazed balcony door really does keep out all the street noise. Lots of thoughtful touches like a well stocked kitchen and bathroom, and little things you might not have with you such as spare Opal cards and an umbrella. Self check in/out made everything easy. Also a very stylishly decorated and clean place, it was a very enjoyable stay."
2016-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Tiffanie,"Overall, we have a pleasant stay. 
Convenient and easy to travel around in Sydney via buses and train. 
Near to Airport.
Well equipped kitchen."

2018-06-26T04:00:00.000Z,13320545,Fiona,"Jessica very kindly accepted our last minute booking - she was very welcoming and her flat is a lovely little place tucked away in Paddington, which has some greats shops and bars and a market and is very well-connected with the CBD.
However, we did have some trouble sleeping due to construction noise and paint smells coming through the floorboards, as there was a shop being fitted on the floor below. Jessica had said there might be mess downstairs at the entrance to the flat, but didn't mention that the work had been continuing late into the night. We raised the issue with Jessica during our stay, and hoped she would be understanding when we requested a partial refund after our departure. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case and we had to work with airbnb to resolve the issue."
2017-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Mikhail,"Third stay at Shuang's place. As always, easy 20-min walk from the International terminal (with luggage), smooth check-in, clean, and quiet. Cookies are a very nice touch! Thanks again!!"

2015-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Kim,"This was the perfect location for a relaxed stay in Sydney; located right on  the water, and the local saltwater pool was gorgeous. The   picnic area at the beach includes a large covered play area for the kids and was the perfect back drop for a family catch up. And 10-15 minutes drive form everything in town. I loved it.  Fred and Bernadette provided a very welcoming and comfortable space; and have thought of every detail. It felt like a home away from home. Thank you. Kim."
2017-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,David,"An excellent recommendation from friends.The accommodation was great with all that you could want and spacious,set in a lovely garden.The location was ideal for the beach at Bronte and walks to nearby beaches.The buses to central Sydney were ideal with only a short journey time.If we ever return to Sydney we would definitely use again"

2016-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,10213499,Simon,"A nice location near Narrabeen Lagoon. There is a lovely path through the forest along the lake to the Sydney Academy of Sport where I attended a few days of training as part of an aikido winter school.
Tracy made us (including wife and three-year-old daughter) feel right at home. She was also kind enough to lend me one of her bicycles for the time we spent there.

2017-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,9849915,Juliane,"I can highly recommend staying with Valentine.Her place is just beautiful, overlooking Bondi Beach. I really enjoyed my time there. You are so close to everything and it is quiet too. Valentine and her boyfriend are very friendly and nice to talk with."
2015-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Linda,"Duncan and Ashlee were the perfect hosts for our first experience with Airbnb in Sydney. From the first moment they let us feel home and give us the feeling of being very warm welcome. It was a pleasure to stay at their very cozy, clean and beautiful home! Thank you so much!!"
2017-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Karen,Location is good. Very close to King Cross station. Host very responsive. A lot of restaurants nearby. Bedroom is facing the road though and might be a little too noisy at night. Not for light sleepers. But overall a very good and comfortable stay.
2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,20206764,Mira,"Tolles Haus mit großer Terasse und schönen hellen Räumen im Obergeschoss in einem netten Stadtviertel, das sich sehr gut eignet, wenn man ein bisschen Ruhe sucht in Sydney und in Strandnähe wohnen möchte. Am Bronte Beach gibt es einen großartigen öffentlichen Pool mit Meerwasser direkt am Strand. William war immer erreichbar und sehr hilfsbereit."
2013-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Jacqueline Yow,"Absolutely lovely stay in the small cosy apartment. Walkable distance to the bus stops and beach nearby. The apartment itself was clean and tidy, and Hernan + his girlfriend was a polite host. Highly recommended. Cheers. :)"
2016-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Vivien,"This is my first Airbnb experience.  The location of the room is excellent with everything you want in Newtown and Sydney at the door-step.  The room is comfortable and spacious.  The host is quick to communicate with the guests. However, the cleanliness of the house needs to be improved.  The bathroom was not cleaned during the entire stay unfortunately.  We ran out of toilet paper every second day.  This room is on the ground floor right by the stairs and also facing the street so it is quite noisy as the window is not fully sealed.  The listing was a little misleading as the host does not live in the house.  "
2017-12-12T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Hylton,"Fantastic.! Victoria was a great host and met us in the lobby on arrival and was very friendly and gave us
some great suggestions. It is a small studio apartment which looked exactly like on the website and is perfect for two people. Location was perfect for exploring the city and walkable to restaurants and Kings Cross station. There was a small kitchen with a hotplate, toaster, kettle and fridge - was perfect for our stay. Great area, great location and would definitely book again and highly recommend!"
2017-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Elisa&Carlo,Wonderful stay!! Belinda was really nice and helpful with suggestions. The house is spacious and well equipped. We highly recommend this place!
2017-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Jp,"Another great staying, the host is awesome! Well done!"
2018-09-03T04:00:00.000Z,21421463,Kevin,"My parents, both in their seventies, stayed in the apartment for eleven nights.  They were very satisfied and found it to be very comfortable and well furnished.  They did suggest that it would have been helpful if the equipment, e.g. washing machine and coffee machine, had simple instructions on their use.  Also, there was very little cutlery - especially a shortage of spoons.

They did appreciate the surrounding quiet environment."
2017-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Anita,Danke Bryan für dein gemütliches cottage. Wir haben es sehr genossen in Glebe zu wohnen. Ein tolles Viertel mit vielen Restaurants und Cafés.
2015-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Steffen,"Wir haben die Zeit bei DJ sehr genossen. Das Haus ist perfekt gelegen - ganz in der Nähe von Cafés, Geschäften und man kommt sogar zu Fuß in die Stadt/zur Oper (oder mit einem der unzähligen Busse). Das Haus/Zimmer ist sehr sauber und sieht genauso aus wie auf den Bildern. DJ ist sehr nett und hilfsbereit, wenn wir ihn gebraucht haben, war er jederzeit da, ohne dass man zu sehr aufeinander sitzt.  Danke für alles!
We really enjoyed our time at DJs House. It is perfectly located - very close to transport, Cafés, Shops and you can easily reach a lot of sights by relatively short walks. The house/room is very clean and looks exactly like the pictures. DJ is a very nice and helpfull guy and helped us when ever needed! Thanks for all!"

2017-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Cerissa,"Leslie was very accommodating and provided all the information needed. The room was nice and cozy. Towels, toiletries, etc. were provided. The room had it's own bathroom and washing machine. The room also had its own entrance. Their home was also a few steps away from the Manly Scenic walk which was great. It was also near the bus stop. We would highly recommend Leslie's place. "
2015-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,6201263,Kevid Giselle,The room is very clean and tidy. The house is so quiet and Robbie is very polite.
2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,23510317,David,Great location and everything was as it reads and looks in the ad. Easy check in and helpful communication for a first time Airbnb user.

2018-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,17028088,Charmaine,"Kathy is an excellent host! She has thought of everything you could need! It really is like a home away from home if you are a solo traveller, 2 couples or a family of 4. Very close to Randwick Racecourse, Coogee beach and shops. I will definitely stay here again if I’m in the same area of Sydney."
2018-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,22295401,Yannis,"Highly recommended. Griffin is a great host and very helpful to any questions! We love the location of it, very close to Kingscross Station. The studio is lovely with everything I need for a weekend, i.e a big comfy bed by windows. The apartment is a few storey up in the building which requires a few staircase walking. Mindful if you have mobility issues. "
2014-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Lim,"The hosts are very friendly and helpful. Great location and a real stunning room!

2018-09-13T04:00:00.000Z,24360345,Shi,"Kevin and Ian are really great hosts! 

Communication with them was clear, quick and concise.

They were so hospitable, they even checked up on us for last minute requests before our check-in.  

Also, they provided us with detailed instructions which made check-in & out  a breeze.

The apartment was immaculate. Exactly what we thought it would be.  Extra towels, linen and the little details such as name tagging the drawers made it extra special. 

The location of the apartment is amazing. Other than being relatively close to the city, it also has a mid sized shopping centre close by and public transport is everywhere.

We will definitely book this place again."
2018-06-22T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Danny,"Fun-tas-tic! We had a great stay.
The house is fully equipped as you would a vacation home and is tastefully done. Comfortable bed linens & mattresses. TV with good sound system. Only wish is to have a speedier broadband internet for the Apple TV as it hangs frequently.
Very centrally located. Close to all transportations, restaurants, grocers, drinks, park & CBD. 
Hosts kept us updated on coming stay. Thanks to Phillip & Matthew."
2015-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Justin,"Hernan was a *lifesaver* for my time in Sydney. When my plans fell through, I needed a place to stay in a hurry before leaving super early for the airport. Hernan's place was a 15min taxi ride away and he gave me the number of a local firm. Air bnb's app was causing some issues and Hernan was so patient and kind with my many messages and took the time to really help me. I was sorry I didn't get to meet him personally to thank him, but I really appreciated all he went through to help me book the room. The bed was so comfortable and the room was super spacious and clean. Hernan's place was easy to get to by bus or train, next time I'd love to stay longer, its right next to a beach! Thanks for everything Hernan, you're awesome!"
2018-07-29T04:00:00.000Z,12098138,Lauren,"Lizzy was a fantastic host and we absolutely loved her Tamarama penthouse, it really exceeded our expectations. Here apartment was clean, fully stocked with everything we needed and more and the location was amazing, close to the beach and a quick walk or bus ride to Bondi Beach. Lizzy went above and beyond to accommodate us and made us feel so welcome, she was wonderful. We have 3 small children and the apartment was perfect for our family, safe, clean and had plenty of toys and other amenities for the kids. We can't say enough great things about our stay. "
2018-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,27716426,Daniel,Fantastic location. Redfern and Central station are both an easy walk away. Many good bars and restaurants nearby. Unfortunately the WiFi in flat 3 doesn’t work. Otherwise excellent. Charles is a quick responder to any queries.

The apartment had ample room and great facilities, yet was also very comfortable and relaxing. I would recommend this stay to anyone visiting Surry Hills looking for somewhere quiet to stay."
2018-08-16T04:00:00.000Z,26334724,Giles,The apartment is great - airy and tidy.  Redfurn is an area being redeveloped so not full of eateries so you might need to travel.  The check in procedure (lock box) needs to be sorted out as at present it's not really safe to arrive a night.
2016-03-12T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Tim,"Marcella is a great host and available to contact as required. as this is a used house (not just rental space) the house is full of useful kitchen/living items to make the stay more user-friendly, although some may feel it is somewhat ""busy"". There is an extensive library for anyone with time to explore. The property is ideal for exploring Maroubra and the beach. 
Internally it feels a little dark without lights on- possibly due to proximity of other buildings and mature vegetation at the rear.  Heat at the time meant we needed fans in every room which were provided. Overall a great site and well located."
2017-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Oscar,"Great place, central location and very welcome setting. Chloe is a great host and easy to get in touch with. Our check in and stay was very smooth, thank you very much! "

Only downfall was having the train run past quiet often and is quiet noisy when trying to sleep at night ."

2016-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Carly,"Natasa was a perfect host! From the moment I arrived at the airport she gave me clear instructions as to how to locate her place via the train. The room was amazing - spacious and clean. The location was great too as I was commuting each day and would only have to leave 5 minutes before to catch the train into the city which would only take 15 minutes. Natasa was always willing to offer advice on places to go and eat too and made me feel really welcome. I would fully recommend staying at Natasa's place and cannot wait to stay again next time I visit Sydney!!! Thanks again for everything :)

Very short walk to bus stop (bus no. 343) which can directly take you to the heart of the city near Westfield/Eye tower. Did not get a chance to use the pool and gym but looked really good. Wendy is a very good host, very understanding and accommodating. Will definitely book this place again. Thanks Wendy :)"

2018-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Daniel,"The location of this place can’t be beat. The main level is very stylish and roomy. Bedrooms require either a walk down a narrow spiral staircase or a walk up some steep stairs. There is no door on the downstairs bathroom. The owner, Philip, is very responsive and accommodating. "

Some of the vintage furniture is aged but to me this only adds to the beauty of the house. The sofa,  beds, linens etc are fresh, clean and comfortable. If you appreciate a period house this place is a delight."
2014-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Niels,We stayed at Hernan's place for give days and enjoyed every single of them. Such a nice atmosphere with Herman and Connie. They gave us good advices and made an awesome BBQ last night. Hopefully see you again guys.

2016-11-06T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Clare,"We stayed here while visiting Sydney for a family function and found the house large enough and very comfortable for the 7 of us. The kitchen is well equipped and Jeremy was very accommodating of our requests for a cot and high chair for our daughter. He was also very responsive throughout our stay and responded quickly to our questions. The house is located in a lovely neighbourhood, with many food and entertainment options nearby. Only downside is the upstairs room did get rather hot, but fans are provided. Overall it provided for a clean, comfortable stay."
2014-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Stacey,"A beautiful stay was had at Cath's gorgeous cottage. She is a most gracious host, having made me delicious bread and a brownie for my birthday! "

The basket for breakfast is really complete and everything is thinked that we lacked nothing. Moreover it was a pleasure to be able to taste the delicious biscuits and bread, all home made by Cath.

I really recommend Cath's studio !"

2017-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,16651655,Peter,Comfortable space in the back yard of the property. Functional and ok for short stays. Some aircraft noise unavoidable being close to the airport. City buses about a 5-10 minute walk.

Cathy was very communicative and helpful, but also gave us privacy which meant it felt like we were alone on a couples holiday."
2017-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Geoffrey,"Terrific place in a perfect location :) 
As the description says this is a room (& seperate bathroom) within a house - the area is partitioned from the rest of the house and has it's own door to the street, so it works. The room itself is terrific - Michele has made a lot of thoughtful touches (coffee, fresh milk etc) and it's very-clean. The area is perfect for exploring the inner-west of Sydney. Michele is a very responsive and generous host (inc kindly allowing us a later check-out due to our flights) - thank you!!"

2017-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,14921505,Rachel,"Beautiful home, the pictures don't do this place justice. The spa overlooking the water at sunset - absolutely perfect. Very spacious, amazing views of the water from all the rooms. Close to the supermarket, restaurants, bottle-o. Great location. Perfect size for 10 guests, and would comfortably accommodate 14. Bailey was great with communication. Can't wait to plan another stay, will definitely recommend to friends and family. "

La porte ouverte toute la nuit pourrait peut être être remplacée par une chatière en hiver ? Wifi un peu inconstant.
On recommande ce logement."
2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Sara,"Simon and Nicole's place is a great little place for a short or extended stay in Sydney. It is close to public transport and amenities. Unfortunately there was a party of one night of our stay at a neighbouring property that went well into the early hours of the morning. Otherwise it was a lovely, quiet location. Thanks Simon and Nicole."

2017-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,15312988,Chris,"I didn't really want to leave! This is a great place. The location is fantastic, 10 mins to beach, 5 mins to shops and bus stops directly outside the building. Couldn't ask for better. There is only one negative I can think of and even this is minor, no offer of teas or coffees for the morning. But that really doesn't take away from how much I enjoyed my stay! The bedroom was pretty much perfect, very comfortable. Bed was amazing! The apartment itself is very clean and tidy. And Cindy the host was great too! So friendly and welcoming. There is no doubt that I would definitely go back to this AirBnB room. Big thanks to Cindy for having me."

2017-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,8106459,Clarisse,Fantastic stay. Brenda's flat is cosy and perfectly equiped for a several nights stay. Brenda is a very kind host and Coogee is a convenient location to explore SYdney without the hustle and bustle of the city. The beach is 7mn down the road and we enjoyed combining visits in Sydney and relaxing on the beach and in cafes in Coogee. There's a bit of traffic on the street so if you shouldn't be too fussy about noise. But for urban dwellers like us that was nothing compared to the quality of the stay. Thanks!

It's a bit of a hike uphill to the shops but well worth it and the ferry terminal is just at the bottom of the street. Can't wait to come back again!"

The apartment itself is really nice, clean, and fairly large. Lachlan was extremely quick and helpful with his responses. Check in and check out were a breeze. Everything was great, except for the dryer in the apartment. If you do laundry, I recommend hanging the clothes out on the line on the roof."

2016-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Esther,"My experience at Naveen's place was the best I've had with Airbnb, from making the booking to checking out! The place was clean, spacious and tidy, provided with more than just the essentials! The location was amazing with everything you need at your doorstep from grocers to cafes, bakeries, restaurants and more.
Not only was Naveen well organised but her communication was flawless which made the whole experience easy, comfortable and memorable. We initially booked for Saturday to Monday but ended up extending another night and checking out Tuesday evening. She was really accommodating considering my friend had a late flight and even let us check out at a time suitable to us even upon a late request. Checking in and out was a breeze! We had no issues with anything whatsoever!
Being able to catch Naveen and Tristan, though briefly as they are very busy, made it even more pleasurable! I highly recommend this place and will definitely book again! "
2017-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Pj,"Very close to the airport, so if you've got a flight the next morning it's great. Far from the city center, I took a cab to Surry Hills for about 30 AUD, so not where you wanna stay unless you wanna take buses or cabs everywhere. "
2017-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Emma,"Belinda's cabin is very clean and comfortable, and spacious for two. The sun hits the porch in the morning so it's the perfect spot for a quiet coffee to start the day. Super close to beautiful Jibbon beach but everything in town is within walking distance anyway. We would definitely recommend."
2018-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,19376053,Heidi,"Convenient, clean and spacious."
2017-09-08T04:00:00.000Z,19254909,Robert,"The place was more or less as advertised, however, it was clear that the host did not make a lot of effort to prepare the place for a guest. Everything, from the refirgerator to the bathroom closet was full of her belongings."
2019-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Anna,A lovely place and location. The apartment is really great with a beautiful view. Anita as a host? Can’t think about a better one. She is so thoughtful and welcoming!
2018-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Birgit,Great location and well set up. Thanks.
2018-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,22412815,Faiz,"I really enjoyed my stay at Leena's place. She is very friendly and accomodating, so communication was effortless.

The place is very clean and well equipped. There is a huge backyard with a variety of flowers that attract colourful birds. I really enjoyed watching the sunset sitting in the huge entertainment deck.

There is easy access to the Sydney CBD via M7/M2. Shops, cafes and takeaway restaurants are just a few minutes walk away."
2013-03-19T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Murray,"I stayed at David's place for 4 nights while I was in Sydney for a friend's birthday. His place was exactly as it looks in the photos.  It was secure, well appointed, spotlessly clean and despite it's proximity to Darlinghurst's nightlife, it was very quiet.

The room had everything you could want, a comfy bed, plenty of storage, aircon, TV with Foxtel and direct access to a sunny deck.  The private bathroom was also modern and  luxurious.

David was a thoughtful and considerate host and made me feel completely welcome.  The booklet he had compiled of the many great cafes, bars and restaurants in the area was also very useful, and I sampled many of them. 

The location is superb, with so much within walking distance, buses practically on the doorstep and trains just a short stroll away. 

I would definitely stay at David's place if I was in Sydney again and highly recommend it to anyone heading to Sydney. 

This was my first experience with AirBnB.  I don't think I'll ever stay in a Hotel again!

Thanks for a great stay, David!"
2014-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Simone,Just spent a lovely weekend with my mom in Cath's Garden Studio. The studio's gorgeous and equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The area is quiet and pretty interesting too - enjoyed my Sunday morning run in the diverse surrounding neighbourhoods :-) Cath is lovely too and very helpful - will definitely be back the next time we are in Sydney.
2016-06-13T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Mel,"Hernan was very open and welcoming. The proximity to the airport was a huge bonus as well.
Thanks for making it a relaxed and comfortable stay."
2015-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Glen,"The place was exactly what we were after - a bit of space and all the amenities of home. The apartment was also extremely clean, beautifully presented with lots of character and was well stocked with the basics.
The location is perfect - A short walk to military rd (fantastic cafes and shops), public transport (buses and ferry) and Balmoral (my favourite place on earth).
Whilst we had limited contact with our host, Mags, she was very accommodating of us (travelling with an infant), proactive in contacting us a few time ahead of arrival to make sure we had the information we needed, and knowledgeable of the local area. 
In summary, we had a great time, loved the place and would definitely stay there again."
2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,1944996,Scott,"Annie was a fantastic host. Very responsive and welcoming! The flat is gorgeous. Very modern and comfortable! The flat is in the best location in Sydney. Walking distance everything. Pick any direction and you'll find great cafes, bars, and restaurants. All of Annie's food suggestions turned out to be fantastic as well! Would definitely recommend this place!"

2016-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,6785160,Sharen,"From the moment that I booked with Carole and Steve I was made to feel welcome.  They are a friendly and helpful couple that went out of their way to ensure that I felt comfortable in their home.  Nothing was too much trouble and the accommodation was excellent.  I was more than happy with the lovely bedroom, the well set up sitting room and the light and airy private bathroom.  I would not hesitate to recommend their establishment for a place to stay in Sydney.  Their house is well situated to bus and train transport and there is local shopping available just down the street.  "
2016-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,9080393,Muhammad,"Awesome place. We book the apartment on a last minute basis and still we get a friendly welcome and help from the the host and her husband!!!

2016-05-25T04:00:00.000Z,9701620,Fiona,"Bryan was a great host, very prompt and thorough when answering any questions both before and during the stay. 

Great location, Glebe on your doorstep and Darling Harbour is a 20 minute walk or short train journey away. 

The cottage is exactly as described, and was spotlessly clean when we arrived. Fabulous balcony with a lovely view, perfect to enjoy your morning coffee or relax with a book.  Comfortable beds and living areas, and the extras left by the host, including travel cards, made everything really easy. 

If I'm lucky enough to return to Sydney I would love to stay here again. "

2018-03-13T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Kouhei,"I stayed here for 2 nights in March in Evelyn's place. It's a beautiful self-contained apartment and pool with amazing views over Pittwater. It's in such a peaceful location and is within 5min walking distance to Paradise beach, the local corner store and restaurants. You are also a 2min car ride away from Avalon - which has a stack of cafes, restaurants, banks, gift stores and a big supermarket.

The rooms were a great size and the place was super clean. Evelyn personally greeted me upon arrival and had many recommendations for local restaurants and things to do. There was also a nice bottle of wine waiting for us to make us feel extra welcome.

Evelyn's place is the perfect place to hang out and relax or to use as a base to explore all the spectacular northern beaches (e.g. Palm Beach, Whale Beach, Avalon Beach, Newport Beach). I would recommend Evelyn's place to any couples looking for a relaxing bush and beach retreat. My only regret is not staying there for longer."

2016-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Sarah,This is a great house in a fantastic location in Mosman. The rooms upstairs are lovely old bedrooms with timber floors and spacious high ceilings. So close to cafes and everything you need on Military Rd. Parking was easy and convenient too! Thanks Rachel for a lovely stay.
2018-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Jeanette,"This is a great location,  an easy 20 minute walk to the international airport along a safe walkway.  The room is clean and comfortable with a great shower and wifi.  The bathroom is shared between two rooms, but this was no problem.  I felt very safe here.  There is a big supermarket 10 or so minutes walk away, so is a great place to stay coming from or heading off on an international flight.   Would recommend to others.  Thank-you."

Thank you Cathy for making me so welcome in your home from the moment I arrived.

 The accommodation is beautiful, the bed was really comfortable with high quality organic bed linen. It was great to have a fridge in the room and delicious breakfast supplies provided. The area of Avalon beach is stunning. I cannot wait to come back! "

The atmosphere of the house was lovely, it really did have a beautiful positive feel to the property. 
I would definitely stay here again :)
Thank you Treen "
2013-07-24T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Romain,"Gavin was by far the best host I had in Oz. (the others were good too) He was there when I arrived, nice, a good conversationalist, good tips, and shared with me his honemade cooking.

His place is just a few minutes walking from Central, the main train stationin town. Plus, it was a 3 minute walk to my favorite coffee shop, Di Bella, that he told me about.

"
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,7549277,Ash,"Mari's home is a lovely family home that is looked after very well.

Location is great being such a short drive to various beaches, there's also bus stops a short walk away, as is the local shopping mall.

The house itself has everything you need, beautiful well kept gardens, a brilliant sheltered BBQ space complete with ceiling fan and speakers to hook music up to, lovely kitchen area, modern bathroom and main ensuite, plenty of towels, aircon works well on hot summer days!

Finally, Mari was very easy to deal with, quick to respond to messages and happy to help where she can. I do not have a single bad thing to say about this home and my family would gladly stay here again!"
2017-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Tyson,Lovely apartment! We look forward to staying again.

2018-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,18620288,Ninetta,"apartment (number 42) is managed by an agent - Sydney Holiday Rentals. It is clean, nicely furnished and decorated, has a well equipped kitchen and is  located in a quiet area of north Sydney.  It is in an oldish block and is as described on the air bnb site, except for  parking. On phoning the agent to arrange a time to be met at the apartment, we were advised there had recently been difficulties with other residents parking in space 42. So, surprise, surprise when we arrived, yes there was a car in space 42. The agent insisted we park in space 43 instead which belonged to another apartment that sydney holiday rentals also manage.  This was not a full size spot and we had great difficulty fitting our Subaru into the spot. After scraping the side of the car on the adjacent concrete pillar it was obvious this spot was next to useless for all but micro cars. After asking the agent 3 times to contact the building manager in order to locate the owner of the car in spot 42 ( which was a standard sized spot) she very reluctantly went away and made a phone call. Miraculously, the owner materialised within less than 5 minutes and begrudgingly moved her ‘illegally’ parked car.  The agent’s insistence we park elsewhere on the property and her resistance to call the building manger, made us wonder whether apartment 42 does not, despite the literature provided for arrival and the advertising, actually come with parking space 42. So, if you need parking, we suggest you find another apartment.

At no point did the agent apologise, either for not being able to deliver on the parking space, nor for arriving 30 minutes late to meet us at the department despite insisting we arrive no later than 4.00.  

Unfortunately this experience spoilt our stay."
2017-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Darius,"David's place is awesome, amazing location and I loved my little morning routine of doing yoga in the sun on the patio outside my room. David was lovely and very easy going, he is a gentlemen."

She met us at the airport and took us back two days later in her car for a small charge. This was very convenient for us. The apartment is spacious and well appointed. It is in a very good location and convenient for the city. Lots of good places to eat within walking distance.

House manual was comprehensive. Little disappointed with little fridge space for 6 nights stay.  Small area to prepare meals. About shower leakage was told on the day. Mould around screen from wet floor was unhygienic."

2014-03-10T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Ty,"The house was in a fantastically convenient location and easily accomodated all 8 of us. House is situated very close to bus lines that go to the city or Bondi Beach, kings cross and all the darlinghurst cafe's and night life is minutes away/

Jeremy attended to any issues we had straight away and was a pleasure to deal with. highly recommend the house and Jeremy as its host."
2018-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Christopher,"Essentially its Kings Cross, a suburb that bears no resemblance to the one of my youth. 
Paul & Lukes apartment is centrally located in a inner suburb that is blessed by trees, exceptional Thai Takeaway and great restaurants. Walking is a breeze. Close to the city. Probably not a great place for light sleepers, with Macleay Street never sleeps. A great classic 1930’s period apartment in character filled neighbourhood"
2018-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Tania,Anita was thoughtful and thorough during check-in to ensure I had everything I needed. The view is spectacular! I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to enjoy Bondi and everything it has to offer.

Paul and Luke are excellent hosts and very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. The apartment is beautifully decorated and the book collection is 'to die for'. Is very clean and the linen is beautiful.  Perfect location for that get away in the heart of Sydney. I highly recommend that this is the best destination for your Sydney stay.
2018-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Allan,"Great location, spacious rooms, rear lane garage and friendly neighbourhood. Nice and solid with polished floors but a little musty so keep those windows open!"

2017-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,16020247,Katie,"This welcoming private colourful terrace is a haven in Newtown. Filled with art and colour. Way better than a sterile apartment! Kassandra was so welcoming and explained the house quirks. She is super fast to respond to messages. Beds were comfy and warm. It’s a short stroll to Newtown and you can get a direct train to Circular Quay. The house is leafy inside and out. Shower pressure was heavenly and kitchen has all you needed. The house is just so atmospheric and eclectic - a beautiful experience more than a place to stay. We loved Marrickville markets and Sydney Park.  Loads of great coffee nearby, the best gelato and great organic and health food shops. Totally recommend."
2014-06-30T04:00:00.000Z,927923,Carlos,"The apartment was perfect!!!
So much space!!!
Definitely a place to recommend.
Julia & Adele were so helpful.
The bus to the city was a couple of blocks away and to get to Bondi Beach was also pretty close.
Being 2 blocks from the Bay made the trip to Manly so nice!!!!!
100% recommended."

2018-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,22378312,Nathan,Great location near Kong’s cross with plenty of places to eat nearby. I felt like I was able to escape the city and relax without really leaving the city.
2017-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,16898275,Luke,"Trent was a great host. The apartment is situated in a beautiful, quiet and peaceful part of Rose Bay. The apartment was extremely clean. We felt right at home and even shared a glass of red with our friendly host. Highly recommend. "

2018-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,19641701,Stuart,"The apartment was very well maintained and clean. It is located in a fabulous and secluded area of Sydney. Catching the ferry to the city, and discovering the rowing club (for drinks) were highlights. Late afternoon visits by the cockatoos was a treat too. You will need to have a car to visit the local shops for groceries."

The place is just as by the pictures, the view is very impressive and the swimming pool, completely private for us, although quite cold at that time of the year, was worth a dive in! Evelyn did all to make our stay very confortable, and accomodate the place for our ten month old! "

When we arrived this beautiful apartment. Everything you see make you feel like home. Because we were there for the Sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras. You can watch the parade at the balcony (Best view ever).
And we thank you for the host making our trip in Sydney unforgettable."

2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Chamika,Sam is a wonderful host. The apartment was very clean and tidy. All the necessary facilities and amenities are provided. Being so close to a shopping centre also is a huge plus. I will definitely stay at this apartment in the future. I highly recommend it if you are looking for good accommodation.

Very unclean - floors, sand in beds, cockroach in kitchen. 
Lack of cooking equipment - we had to go and purchase a frying pan."
2018-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,30056291,Andrew,"Nick is an excellent host and his place is 5 star standard. Great central location, beautifully furnished, spotlessly clean, good amenities, you can't ask for more. Check in and check out was easy and Nick is a great host. I highly recommend staying with Nick and I would definitely stay again!"
2015-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Ashley,"We stayed at Cathy's place for a friends wedding over the weekend and absolutely loved it! It was perfect for a comfortable nights sleep, very clean, nice and modern. Cathy was lovely, making sure we had everything we needed and then leaving us to it. We were running a little late so had to rush in and get ready before taking off to the wedding!
The area is perfect too, just down the road from the shops and not too far to the beach. We will definitely be staying there again in the future if we are up that way and recommending to our friends. Thanks Cathy! "
2016-09-18T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Reza,"Gavin's apartment is really well organised and certainly lacks nothing. The location is great too, very close to local amenities, good cafes and restaurant (I highly recommend next door Italian cafe, the food is superb and the staff are friendly too). Gavin's instruction is also very clear."
2018-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,29466814,Josh,"Our stay at Cathy’s was good. It had a cool vibe, for the space available, Cathy has made it look great with some cool artwork, books layed out in a funky way on the shelf, wooden features etc. Bed was comfy, shower was good (doesn’t just dribble water) and it’s in a good location. Just around the corner from redfern station, which makes getting into the city centre super easy. The nearby surrounding area is alright, few shops and bars nearby. Cathy is very attentative, too. She replies to your messages as quick as you would reply to a text. So if you need anything, you’ll get an answer pretty quick."

2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,22297561,Chloe,Lovely studio with all the homely features. Sam was outstanding with communication and responding. She was very accomodating and flexible to make sure our stay was fantastic! Highly recommend this beautiful place :)
2015-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Kellie,"Cath's studio was a delight. It was all the little extras like a slice of cake waiting for you upon returning back for the evening, home made jam, biscuits, gourmet butter for eggs on toast, chocolate, trail mix... that make it so much more personable and enjoyable than a hotel.  It has to be one of the best and most authentic airbnb places I have stayed in. 
Cath has thought of everything! Comfy bed, choice of pillows, great shower and super clean. It is also close to the airport and train stations to easily get into the heart of the city. Highly recommended! "
2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,17438054,Silvia,"It is actually our first time on air bnb and the first experience with this place was an awesome one, the place is very clean, tidy and George actually went on the extra mile by providing us with some toys, knowing that we have our son with us as well. George has been very helpful and we look forward to staying in this place in the near future"
2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Gordan,"Natasa's house is just by the train station, which is very convenient. We asked her opinions on where to go for new years's eve and she and her friend provided lots of very useful suggestions. She's the best host ever!"

2016-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,5347035,Kathy,"Fantastic location, great place, a few bumps. The apartment was very clean, very comfortable, in a great neighborhood.  Javier was not in town but contacted me via email to make sure all was ok when I arrived.  I had originally booked a different place but it was cancelled last minute so I was lucky to find Javier's place.  Unfortunately, I was driving and did not have time to verify the parking situation.  Javier tried to offer ideas, but in reality I was stuck paying for parking whenever I was at the apartment on either a 1-hour or 2-hour meter.  Pricey and inconvenient!  If you are not driving, you'll really enjoy the chill apartment and great neighborhood."
2017-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Alex,"Millie's ""shoebox"" (as she calls it) is an adorable little corner of North Sydney with easy access to trains and buses. Plenty of nearby food and drink, and her recommendations will definitely enhance your stay. Check in/out was easy as could be. Would stay again!"

2016-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Brandon,"My family and I very much enjoyed our stay in Sydney largely due to Bryan and his lovely house. We were traveling with a 16 month old so the pram, portable high-chair and other baby/kid amenities were a major plus for us. Bryan even offered to come over and install a baby gate for us in the house! 

Everything in the house was clean when we arrived and there were multiples of all the basics such as towels, toilet paper, etc. We have stayed other places where only 1 towel per person is provided. Bryan even dropped off extra pillowcases and toilet paper during our stay =) Bryan was also more than accommodating to our travel schedule and even offered to let us check out later. 

The house is close to public transit so it's really easy to get to places. The house even has OPAL cards to you to use during your stay. There is an abundance of eclectic foods to choose from only a block or two away. 

We really enjoyed our stay in Glebe and will definately look to stay here next time we are in Sydney."
2018-08-28T04:00:00.000Z,23650892,Nathan,"A bright and spacious loft apartment. The decoration, styling was stunning. The bedrooms are awesome for the views and the comfort. The location is so user friendly, close to everything from great cafes for the morning brunch. To an array of restaurants for dinner. And easy access to the city. Best for people arriving via public transport. Puppy friendly, which meant our cavoodle was safe and comfortable too. "
2018-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,1944996,Elle,"Close to public transport, 10 mins walk to Museum station. A lot of places to go eat around the area and grocery stores if you plan to do shopping for regular food. 
The apartment itself is really cozy and quiet, no noise from the outside. Annie was a great host, great communication. Overall a great place to stay and would definitely book again!

2017-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Paul,Chloe was a great host. Very easy to get in touch with and was really understanding and accommodating when our travel plans went slightly awry. Apartment is perfectly positioned to explore Sydney .

The house is perfect for a large group and communication with Bailey has been fantastic, he has been very quick to respond. A little car juggling may be required however a small price to pay for this top location."

A special thank you to the host Lynne! She was amazing, thoughtful, kind and caring. She looked after me like I was a member of the family! Thank you so much to you all for taking so good care of me :) (Phone number hidden by Airbnb)"
2018-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,22509800,Jennifer,"TLDR:  We had a pleasant stay as a family of 5, with kids ages 8-13.  It was clean and as described.  Some things were annoying but we slept well and loved the accessibility.  

Sally's place has a GREAT location for public transit. Legit <10 min walk (kid-pace) to the central train station, once we figured out the fastest route.  We used the trains and buses and also walked to many central destinations.  Perfect for our needs.  

Don't be put off by the odd configuration.  The lounge room with beds is spacious and comfortable.  We used it both for kids' bedroom and eating.  Didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment otherwise so that was just fine.  The only issue was eating over carpet; we had to vacuum to manage crumbs between meals.  

The biggest drawback here was in the bathroom.  The toilet is LOUD when it's refilling--kind of a squealing sound as if the shower is on.  Made us not want to flush after anyone went to bed.  And speaking of the shower, it was one of the worst I've encountered!!  Low pressure and the temperature would change randomly from cold to scalding hot (and NOT while anything else was using water in the apartment.) My family was amused by my yelps as I got hit by hotter water than I could stand, but I wasn't!  A bath was more pleasant, and perfect for the kids, but be aware that the tub is an odd shape.  It narrows at the upper end and anyone larger than my US-size-10 bottom can expect not to be able to sit in it for a soak.  

Kitchen is clean and minimally-adequately-equipped.  There are just enough pots & pans to do some basic cooking, but only one huge awkward knife.  I've suggested they get a better set!  There was a dishwasher but not much detergent so we mostly washed by hand.  I wish there had been a teapot--I made tea in a saucepan.  You'll find some very basic supplies (salt/pepper/sugar/tea) but otherwise pretty much bare cupboards--this isn't one of those places where you'll find some edibles left from previous guests.   That's fine; some people really prefer it that way.  Just be aware you'll need to supply most all condiments, oils etc.  if you plan to cook.  

We liked having the clothes washer and some detergent was provided.  

The shades are good in the bedroom but in the lounge/bedroom there's a slight bay window that can't be darkened as fully.  Thankfully the kids were jet-lagged enough to sleep well anyway.  

One thing that gave me a weird feeling were all sorts of ominous signs and letters to residents posted in the lobby and elevators--it sounds like the building is recently under new management and getting its financial affairs in order?  Also lots of rules about visitors and not letting people in or loaning out your key, which made me wonder if they've had problems with objectionable people?  We didn't encounter anything untoward, but it doesn't create a great atmosphere."

Would definitely come again."
2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,26334724,Hannah,Enjoyed our stay at Franca and Alessios place. Apartment was as described on the listing and in the pictures and location is close to Redfern and Surry Hills and within easy reach to the city. Check in was very smooth and great instructions were provided and response to emails was swift. Would recommend.
2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,26829659,Stacey,"The place was great, spacious and roomy. We were attending ANZ for a conference and whilst it was only me who stayed there, you could easily accomodate 5-6 adults comfortably. Two bathrooms is also great when trying to get ready. Great views from the balcony and air con and blinds made more a comfortable stay.
The kitchen space was great but you will need to take your own milk, tea/coffee and breakfast items if wanting to use them. There is a convenience store downstairs and just outside but beware it is quite expensive too so only purchase limited items there. A few restaurants etc also down there with variety of cuisine too."
2015-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Caitlin,"Great apartment in an awesome part of Sydney. Nicole met us and showed us around - she was fantastic and really friendly.

Avalon was beautiful. We discovered the street we where on is not only close to avalon beach but also a stone through away from paradice beach - which is a small beach on the pittwater side of avalon. Stunning! 

Thank you Cathy 
We loved our stay!!"
2018-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,22536824,Melissa,"We had a great stay at Clare's place while we were in town to see if we would like to move Sydney. Clarw was really flexible and responsive to our very last minute arrangements and even let us leave our bags on the last day, which was really helpful. The room was great and excellent location to see Newtown and the rest of the city via the train! Thanks for a great stay"
2015-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Greg,"Naveen and Tristan were absolutely wonderful hosts (as was Felix - who is adorable and cuddly).  The room and amenities were even better than I expected, and I would whole-heartedly recommend this listing.  The location was perfect for quickly getting to Sydney's hot spots, and the local restaurants and coffee shops were a delight to wake up to every day.  Even the concierge/doorman went out of his way to be accommodating in any way possible.  If you are considering staying with Naveen, book it now.  You won't regret it. "

Belinda was accommodating and a pleasure to rent from.  

I would recommend it to any friend. "
2016-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Angel,"I booked for an extended stay at Angela's apartment and it was everything I could hope for in an Airbnb stay and more! The apartment was extremely clean and well-kept with all the amenities included.  I loved the beautiful marble bathroom and the spacious living space.  The kitchen included a stove top, microwave, toaster and kettle so I was able to easily prepare simple meals and breakfast.  The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and there are various cafes and restaurants just around the corner.  It is also within a short walk to Wynyard station and major shopping spots.  This apartment was perfect for my stay in Sydney and I highly recommend it to everyone looking for a home away from home :)"

It is new, fresh, comfortable with everything you need and a beautiful balcony opening up to the breeze. We really enjoyed the view overlooking the racecourse, and loved watching the horses getting walked past the apartment. We needed to stay close to the Prince of Wales hospital and I particularly liked that there was a secure car parking space for our car. "

Staying at Adrian’s House for 6 month was great and a real Australian experience. All housemates (Adrian, Conor, Rhys and Alessandro) integrated me into their circle of friends and took me to cool places. 
Thanks for becoming good friends and for the amazing times. I’ll miss you and visit you soon. :-)"

2016-01-23T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,David,"The apartment is conveniently located in Sydney's CBD near Darling Harbour and just a short walk to trains, Martin Place, etc. Sydney is a very walkable city and this apartment is in the middle of the city, so the location is tops. For the price, it would not be possible to find a better place. Clean linens and towels were provided. The apartment has a dish washing machine in the kitchen and a washer & dryer for laundry. They all worked fine. The host even left a box of welcome chocolates which was a nice touch.
We stayed during an unusually hot week. As the aircon is in the main room and not the bedroom, this did mean the bedroom was quite warm. It was not a deal breaker for us.
Clean, the apartment is not brand new, but for the rate absolutely acceptable. I would recommend the apartment."
2017-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Patrick,I booked Linda's place for my Dad who was visiting Sydney. He really enjoyed his stay. It was walking distance to everything and Linda was very thoughtful in how she prepared the place for visitors.
2017-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Tim,"My wife and I needed a room near the airport because we had a morning flight the next day. This room had a perfect location, was within walking distance to the train station/grocery, and was very clean. The aesthetics of the room and bathroom were modern. Basic ""hotel"" amenities were provided. Shuang's instructions were very clear and everything worked as expected. Great price for a great room."
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,21637487,Simeon,"Kasey’s place is the best place to stay in Bondi. You can literally walk out of the apartment and right onto the beach. She was such a fantastic host, extremely responsive and accommodating, and we will certainly be back one day!"

2018-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,17967409,Yinika,"Helen and Mike were great hosts, very friendly, kind and relaxed. I was in the area for some archaeology work, and would often come back to the spotless house covered in dust and mud, but they never complained. The house is in a quiet location but only a short drive to the supermarkets."

2018-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,20962081,My Tien,Min’s place was a great spacious apartment for the 5 of us that stayed there. It’s right in the middle of the city area and close to so many restaurants and shops. She was lovely to communicate with and we had a great time. The massage chair was an extra bonus and we all loved it.
2015-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Melanie,"We absolutely loved our stay at Bronte B&B Studio! Susan was so accommodating and the studio was clean and fresh and tastefully decorated. We loved all the extra touches - fresh fruit and yogurt in the fridge, lovely organic teas! It's a nice short walk to the beach and there are lovely cafes and restaurants nearby. We will definitely be recommending the studio to our friends and would stay there again when we are next in Sydney."
2018-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Everson,Wendy’s place was stylish and immaculate. Luxurious features with a reasonable price. It’s a little bit out of the city but I would recommend staying here. Thanks again Wendy.

Very well put together house, we joked that we wanted to decorate our apartment like it when we got back. The amenities Julia kindly left us were a very nice touch and much appreciated! Everything about Julia’s airb&b is very cozy, from the towels to the bedding. The location is unbeatable with the opera house only 20 minutes away! A very nicely located apartment. If you get the chance I would 100% recommend!"
2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Amy,"you couldn't find a much better location for seeing what Sydney has to offer! 
bed was comfortable and a lot of toiletries and cleaning products left so you don't need to worry about buying things."
2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,1944996,Lauren,Annie’s place showed much better in person. The decor was cute and definitely reflected Surrey hills trendy vibe. There was so much to explore in the area and was perfect walking distance to anything. The bed was super comfy and the place was quiet after a long day out. I would definitely recommend this place to others.
2018-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Andrew,"Great location re the beach, great host who communicated well and was friendly and helpful, only negative was that street is a little busy."

2019-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,20906942,Sara,"Good value for money - location was an excellent base for exploring Sydney, being so close to Central Station. 

Fitted out with all the basics - kitchen had cooking utensils, but the microwave/oven is a bit confusing and we couldn't find any instructions. 

The sofa-bed was more comfortable than the mattress and there was plenty of space in the studio apartment."
2016-03-29T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Urszula,"Belinda is great , friendly host, she saved our lives with her supplies 
( as IGA was closed on Good Friday).The accommodation is lovely, private and has everything what you may need. We really enjoyed our stay in Garden Studio and hope to be back! Thank you! Ula & Pete"
2018-08-07T04:00:00.000Z,16087198,Kannan,"The advertised #8 room is a great spot for the business traveller who has work in the area. Public transport (bus) easily accessible. Eastwood shops and train only brisk walk away.

The rooms is good sized and is private, with separate entry. Has heating to (albeit a little noisy) ward off the winter chill. The shared bathroom is kept really clean and tidy. The non-stop hot water in the shower is fabulous with excellent pressure. It is quiet as a mouse at night. Wifi is excellent. Coffee/tea making facilities - cooking if you’re inclined and even a washing machine to use.

Please remember this is someone’s home and therefore no frills like a hotel - the hosts are warm, generous and happy people. 

Excellent value for money!!!"
2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,29466814,Mats,"Good location, clean, cozy. Like our own little home in Sydney. It had everything we were looking for in a Airbnb! Cathy was very nice as well, thanks again"

It has an underground carpark. it's perfect for those have a good rest and visit the surroundings of Sydney. Very convenient: the supermarket is just at the corner of the street. there are many other shops around, even fashion/sport outlets not far away (130, Botany rd; NB sports). shopping center with Coles is 1 mile away. Overall, it was a great stay."
2016-04-10T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Alisa,"Thank you Susan for this wonderful stay! 
The accomondation was very cosy and the breakfast was delicious, especially the home grown passion fruits!"
2017-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Guin-Ming,"Jeremy's place was great.  There is plenty of room for guests as the 4 bedrooms can accommodate many. Three different terraces to sit out and enjoy as well as the back yard.  The real advantage is how close it is to shops and sights.  A short walk to hyde park, oxford street and kings cross. Walk a bit more and you are at the royal botanical gardens and the opera house.  Big kitchen and dining table so everyone can sit and eat together. Washrooms were smaller then expected and a few more stairs then we thought but we would highly recommend staying here if you are in Sydney and want to be near the CBD and some of the tourists sights."
2017-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,20906161,Sunho,"Very clean, Stylish decoration, Easy access to Central Main staion, Excellent communication, Good matress for traveler, My family had really good time in this double floored apartment. The building is the best for traveler by train and also could be used for ones who wants walking along to the City, Hyde park. Addiotnally, the nice cafe and restraunt in SurryHills are recommnedable."
2016-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Paul,Susan has a small cottage at her home in the backyard. Perfect for one or two people. I stayed there 3 nights and really enjoyed my time there. The cottage comes with everything you need including your own bathroom. Susan is a very gracious and polite host. She took the time to explain the best way to travel in and out of the city. Took only 20-30 minutes to be right in the middle of Sydney. Such a beautiful city!! Wish I could have stayed longer. Enjoyed my time at the cottage.
2015-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Justin,"We felt perfectly welcome and warmly invited stepping off the boat and walking up to the beach house.  Everything we needed was there, and even more!  The beach house was exactly as described, and even more beautiful than the pictures.  Everything worked, and the tree house was a great treat too.  Thank you for a great long weekend and we look forward to visiting again!"
2018-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,22268452,Noemie,"We had a great stay at Shaun's place. The area is great, with a beach, buses and stores/restaurant nearby.
The bed was very confortable and the kitchen well equiped. Shaun was a very nice host, the quality/price  ratio is really good, I recommend the place!"
2018-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Ely,"It's a given that the location was the best part about it. It was very clean and Philip was very attentive and explained everything for us in person which was a nice touch. The downstairs ""wine cellar"" was a bit scary at first, but it made things interesting. The second bedroom was perfect in the sense that it had a good mix of a specious bedroom and best bathroom of the house. The top floor bedroom's bathroom was very tight and the downstairs bathroom seemed to get soaked everywhere when you showered. Overall, it was a very neat place to stay. It was a lot of fun to hang out at the house. Somewhere you can feel relaxed and really feel ""at home."""
2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,18793287,Paul,This is the perfect house for two couples. Very well equiped and location is close to shops and train station. Highly recomended

2018-04-04T04:00:00.000Z,20374683,Lori-Ann,This location is great. Walking distance from the Central railway station as well as close to food and shops. Phan is an excellent host. We arrived in Sydney at 630 am and Phan allowed us to drop our bags off around 10 am so we could get started on our day . The apartment is very clean and secure. It was perfect for a group of 4 .

There were little touches like the basic food and shower products provided which is great for the light traveler. Anita was very helpful and hospitable, and gave some great tips for things to do in the area. Comfortable bed and very clean. Very highly recommend!"
2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,18917022,Sebastian,"This place was AMAZING!! 1 bed and 1 sofa bed and 1 rolling bed. The unit is self was clean and 100% as expected. 

Location Location Location!!! This place is 8 feet from the ocean. It was beautiful to walk outside and go snorkeling with minutes of waking up. Perfect to watch the sunrise with a cup of coffee. 

On top of that the walk along the ocean to the downtown area was stunning. Seeing the surfers and waves roll in on the walk was nice. It is only a 8 min walk to the main downtown of manly. 

Rod was awesome and very helpful. He even had a free for our car. 

100% will rent again."
2016-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Sarah,This was a perfect getaway from the city.  A beautiful little apartment with the comfiest bed and best shower ever! I will be going back :)
2019-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,26334724,Utppal,"Overall we had a comfortable stay at Franca & Alessio's  apartment. Redfern Station is only a 5 min walk away and convenient stores & several food joints are in close proximity - making the apartment conveniently located.
A little more attention to the cleanliness and functioning of kitchen appliances would have made our stay more pleasant."

And thanks for Naveen's recommendation of gelato which were really good! Great stay. Hope go back one day to play with Felix again. :)"

Nicole is an absolute pleasure who goes above and beyond to ensure her guests wellbeing.  We will be back :-)"
2015-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Usman,"Hernan is a great host. Cooperative, friendly and accomodating. The place is just as advertised. Neat, organised and all amenities properly provided. The location is wonderful with the beachy winds and easy access to bus and train. Being close to the airport helps for new comers. Hernan respects privacy and tidiness and was kind enough to offer any help when needed like a ride to the station in the rain or things like bank, train, buses or eating his delicious food. I would stay again and recommend him as  terrific host."
2018-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,20906942,Yibei,I love the place! It's warm and at grate location! The place feel like home:)
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,2900140,Sadie,"Anne is a genuinely lovely lady and a great host. Very generous with her time and local knowledge.  We were travelling with our young son and she had a cot and high chair, as well as a basket of toys which made all the difference!

The flat is really well located near to Newport Beach and we were able to borrow a sun umbrella and boogie board. 

It’s quite compact but perfect for one or two people wanting to get away from the city for a few days. We were able to get there by bus directly from Sydney."
2017-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,15889399,Anna,Very cute tiny home! Close to train station and great little neighbourhood with great portugese chicken and thai food!
2014-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Lisa,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Kerri's place. She is a wonderful host and very welcoming. There was a delicious cooked dinner on my arrival and a lovely Breakfast laid out for me to help myself in the morning. I enjoyed sitting on the spacious balcony looking back towards Sydney. The whole place is very clean. The bedroom is spacious and the bed very comfortable. I enjoyed my own bathroom with plenty of fresh towels. Kerry's place is a lovely peaceful home away from home.  I would come back anytime I am in Sydney. Thank you very much Kerri.
2015-04-26T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Iain,"The apartment is ideally located in a cool suburb of the city with plenty of bars and cafes nearby (we recommend the Dove & Olive!) The room was basic but clean, and Gavin kindly provided us with towels.

2018-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,19376053,Megan,Andrew's place was perfect for a group of 4 traveling to Sydney. There were so many great places to eat like Spice Alley and countless cafes for breakfast or lunch. The proximity to the Central Park Mall and the Central station was so convenient. The local tips were great. We already want to plan a trip back to Sydney!

2017-03-07T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Stewart,"Cathy has done well to transform a basement area into a bedroom and lovely ensuite, but I think it needs a little more work as it was a bit musty when we were there, in very wet Sydney weather."
2018-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,17223695,Judy,"This is our second time here and it is just great.  You can really relax when you know everything is perfect, not only the location but everything is clean, functional and practical, and on top of that so many nice touches like the Tim Tams in the fridge and the lovely organic shower wash and apple shampoo.  Every time I see a green apple I will think of Portobello!  With 4 teenagers, it is just the best place.  I appreciated the garage and the extra parking spots as my kids have their own cars now and we all come together at Manly.  We are making lovely memories and are already planning our next stay.  Anita is an exceptional host, super prompt replies and so helpful and friendly. Everything is just so fantastic, come and see for yourself and stay as long as you can."

Really lovely to spend time with Wendy again, and the fact that everyone knows your name is charming. Looking forward to coming back again soon!"
2018-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,18130053,Syafidah,"Place was as per picture! Really awesome place to stay in, we wished we had the chance to stay longer! Surrounding area is still under some construction, but it wasn’t any major issue. Place is very accessible; only 5mins from the airport and cost between $15-$18 by Uber. There is also a petrol kiosk abt 2-3mins walk with a 24hr convenience store which was good if you need to get stuff urgently. Mascot train station is barely 5mins walk from the apartment and it takes you everywhere into the city which is abt 3 stops away. There are plenty of eateries outside the train station you can choose from, and there’s a Halal Thai eatery serving good food as well as a Kebab store and also an Indian cuisine place, to name a few, which was a plus for us considering we are Muslim. There’s also a big Woolsworth for you to shop across the station. Evan’s place is huge, very comfortable and very clean! Great to relax after a long day out on the huge and comfy sofa! Thank you Evan!"
2016-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Martin,My partner and I were in Sydney and stayed at Hugo's place.  Great apartment centrally located.
2014-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Kerstin,"Hernan hosted me 2 nights on weekdays. He has to work, so we have not much time together. But he is a very kind person and easy to get along with him. He gave me an extra key which I really appreciate. You have also free WiFi. I would definitely recommend Hernan and his flat."
2016-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Joanne Sullivan,"Fabulous apartment, central location, great facilities and million dollar views!
Within walking distance to a fabulous array of dining experiences plus the pubs of both Kirribilli and North Sydney! What more could you ask for!"
2015-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Heather,"We loved staying here!  I never met Michy, but my husband said she was just the sweetest woman ever!  She brought us greek yogurt and granola for breakfast which was very sweet.  It is across the street from the bay and we even took out their surf skis briefly.  We loved being so close to Avalon Beach!  Great restaurants and beach nearby."

2018-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Lisa,"Another enjoyable stay. All aspects exceeded my expectations. Will be a regular visitor for work trips and highly recommend for it’s location, fresh modern decor and special touches."
2017-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Daniel,"Quite enjoyed my stay at Nataša's. The room was nice, the bathroom large and well stocked, and the overall hospitality was excellent.

The house happens to be a short walk from a strip of great brunch and coffee places. The closest establishment, West Village -a gastropub, for a lack of a better term- is 100 metres away from the house. (It's great for lunch and I instantly fell in love with it for its aesthetic, food offerings, and tap list.)

Nataša was a helpful and fun host. We ended up running into each other at pizzeria (Gigi) one evening and enjoying schooners at a brewery (Batch) on another evening. Our casual chats were delightful and full of insight.

Not a single complaint."
2017-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,6201263,Sam,Yoco's share house is a great little alternative abode a stones-throw from the heart of Sydney. He was prompt to reply to any of my queries and was more than accommodating. Great value for money as well and definitely recommend to anyone needing a friendly place to stay.
2018-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Helen,Wonderful base for my visiting parents. Desireé was so helpful and conscientious and I can’t recommend her apartment enough.
2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Sukanta,"It is our first trip to Sydney, with my family including our 1-year-old, and all thanks to Linda, this was an amazing trip. Especially, my 1-year-old enjoyed it a lot. The property is very very close to Redfern (5 min walk) which means going to anywhere in the CBD is very very easy. There are a good cafe and a pub just in front of the property, which means you are covered if you are too lazy :-).

We chose to cook most of the days, as Linda ensured all cooking amenities are readily available for the guests. I could reach out to her and ask her any question and always got a prompt response. Overall, I highly recommend this property to anyone, especially anyone with kid(s)."
2018-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,21127680,Yufeng,"Very friendly host, great location. affordable price. Highly recommended!!!"
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,16020247,Anna,"This is a lovely garden & art focussed place to stay, very quirky and fun.  It is so central to everything, easy walk to both King Street & Enmore Road.  It's nice staying somewhere a little more personal, and Kassandra was just SO welcoming.  Highly recommended!"
2018-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Umang,"Danny’s apartment is nice and the location is very convenient. However there can be noise from the apartment next door if there are noisy guests staying in there. If you can sleep through the noise, then it’s a great place to stay."
2012-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Leanne,"I very much appreciate staying at David's place. He is a wonderful host. Any question I had, if he didn't know he'd look it up on his i-pad...even, 'what time does the sun rise?' His place is clean and attractive. I loved the little balcony off of my room. I ate most of my meals out there. I hgihly recommend his place. Thank you, David."
2018-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Sandeep,"Great place with amazing hospitality, and it is only located 1 stop away from the city! Duncan and Ashlee are amazing and have some great tips to share."
2016-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Cecelia,"Fabulous location and lovely living and dining area, big enough for our group of 8, however there wasn’t 8 adult beds. Probably should be advertised as 6 adults 2 children, the 2 trundle beds were smaller than a single bed an our 5 ft 2 inch companions feet hung off end.

Very generous with late check out.

Definitely would stay there again.

2016-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,12117514,Louise,"Great location, very close to the beach. Gwen and Jim were very helpful."
2018-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,23312848,Stephen,"A beautiful house in a quiet upmarket location. Nice touches from Richard with some groceries and toothbrushes. We found it convenient for access to Manly and the ferry terminal. I recommend getting the App Ride plus who for $3.10 per person will pick you up from the door to any location in the catchment area. You can book a time slot in advance, Monday to Friday only up to 9.30 pm. Otherwise a frequent bus service just down the road number136. Parking in Manly car parks is free for 2 hours but expensive thereafter. So best to leave the car behind if going into Sydney CBD. North Curl Curl beach is just down the road. Distant views of Sydney from the front of the house."

2018-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Tiffany,"I have stayed at Desiree’s place twice now as I travel for work and it’s one of my favourite Sydney accomodation venues. It’s is absolutely spotless, secure, quiet and the most convenient location. Desiree is an excellent and attentive host - this place deserves every great review it gets and more"
2015-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Alysha,Wayne and Kate were wonderful hosts. The apartment was clean and as the pictures depict.  The location was phenomenal and the bottle of champagne a delightful bonus...The amount of thought that has gone into making guests welcome and having all things available was very much noted and appreciated.
2018-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,20962081,Jing,very nice location
2018-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,24874349,Vanessa,"Sarah’s place is in a very nice area, super convenient/ walking distance to the CBD. Lots of restaurants in close proximity. We mostly did our own thing, but Sarah also invited me to a dinner, which was thoughtful. We had a couple of miscommunications, but all worked out in the end. I probably had way too much baggage to stay here (including dive gear), but Sarah was accommodating, and this wouldn’t be an issue if you were traveling light (which I rarely do, due to the nature of my work)."
2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,24660064,Peter,The apartment has all you need and the location is very good.

2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Emily,"Richards house at Mackeral Beach was amazing and Richard was a responsive and helpful guest. Despite the initial trouble locating the property in the dark and rain with three children in tow, we were thrilled to arrive and settle in to the small but very well appointed and beautifully decorated cottage. Absolutely everything you could need for a comfortable stay was at your fingertips, not to mention the beach, view, sunrises and an amazing garden, and our family of 5 had a very memorable and unique long weekend there. The only thing worth noting for families with young kids is to be aware that the 'tree house', whilst stunning, is probably not suitable for children under the age of 8-10 if sleeping alone. Despite this we would return in a heartbeat and recommend to all! Thank you Richard!"
2018-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,1143151,Natalie And Matt,"We absolutely loved staying here. Fantastic bridge views. Amazing breakfast hamper.  Brilliant guide / tips book. Can walk, bus or catch ttain or ferry to the city. Quiet street. Fantastic apartment in great central location.  Good night life in Kirribilli.  LOVED IT.  Only slight glitch is that the bathroom is an en suite bathroom so if 2 people stay bear in mind you have to walk through bedroom to access shower & toilet and whether you are okay with that."
2019-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Denise,"Ideal for golfers and beach in walking distance. 
Did not have a car and used an opal card on the buses /trains  easy to get everywhere on them 
We are a retired couple over sixty."
2018-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,22337456,Jacqueline,"Wendy was easy to reach and check in was straightforward. Loved the amenities, excellent location and plenty of street parking available."
2015-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Sadira,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hugo's apartment. The location is absolutely ideal and the apartment is well outfitted for a comfortable stay in Sydney. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place.
2017-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Rebecca,Sarah was a very helpful host who was there when we needed her and who we otherwise didn't see. The room is nicely furnished and quite comfortable. The bathroom is shared with the host's laundry and has a separate entrance as stated in the description. The bed was good (soft) and there were basic kitchen amenities which was very handy. This was an excellent place to use as a base while visiting the area. Thank you for your hospitality.
2017-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,15820774,Stijn,The host canceled this reservation 76 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2017-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Carlee,Such a beautiful spot! Shame it was raining and we couldn't enjoy the beach over the road. Thanks so much!

2016-07-14T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Gloria,"Angela's place was exactly as pictured in a nice and secure building. I enjoyed the quietness, and she was very respectful of my needs and privacy. I'd return to her place next time I visit Sydney!"

2017-03-29T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Floriane,"The location is good, close to public transport and centrally located to visit Sydney, the car park is very convenient as well. We didn't meet Linda in person but the communication went great, she was very responsive. Cleaning to be improved. "
2014-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Steve,"Wonderful cottage. Two problems - on the main flight path for Sydney Airport, but tolerable. Make sure you ask Sue if the hot water booster button has been pushed, otherwise you may not get hot enough water in the shower."
2017-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Lesley,"This is a lovely home in a very central part of Sydney. The home has lots of personality and is beautiful. The only downside was that I left my Kindle behind by accident, and because I don't live in Sydney, and the owner lives overseas it wasn't very easy to organise to have it collected within the timeslots allocated to me by the owner. That can't be helped though. It was my own fault for forgetting it and the owner did the best she could."
2016-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,15332652,Brooke,"Lilian made the stay lovely, the place was extremely clean. Lilian went out of her way to organise an iron when I needed one which was a huge help. She also wrote me a lovely list of places to eat around the location and they were awesome suggestions! "
2015-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,2900140,Melinda & Derek,"My partner and I enjoyed our short stay at Andi's Neiafu unit 2.  It was clean, well set-up, comfortable and welcoming unit.  Kitchen is fully stocked and lounge area downstairs had all that we needed. The queen size bed was comfortable and bathroom (shower) is located upstairs. The bathroom is on the smaller size but works for the place. Perfect for a couple or a single traveler who wants to chill out. There are also some lovely places to sit outside and it has a tropical beach feel about it. Additionally, it was a pleasant surprise to have little treats and breakfast items left for us in their kitchen area. We wished we had more time to explore the area as our stay was a short one. Bottom line, I recommend this place and hope to stay here in the future again."
2014-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Trent,"Very responsive, smooth checkin/checkout, some unexpected little niceties, and a very interesting house."
2016-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Binna,"Paul's flat is located in Potts Point where there are many nice cozy, fancy shops nearby. Also walking distance to Opera House, Botanical Garden so it was nice to walk around. 

However, it is also close to Kings Cross station and it could be little dangerous at night. I saw many drug addicts on the street and felt insecure. 

I am not expecting 5 star hotel when choosing Airbnb but I would expect more when I am still paying quite amount for the service. My biggest concern was the bathroom, not about the size but level of hygiene in it. I could see black mould from ceiling and wall, shower curtain was small and it kept sticking onto me when taking a shower and bathroom drain was rusty. I originally booked 6 nights but was provided 3 towels and no extra. It could be nice if extra towels can be provided for longer term stay. 

It would be also nice if the cleaner can clean the flat more thoroughly. I still saw the hairs here and there on the floor (of course) and on the couch, not to mention underneath the bed, couch..

Understand that there are bars, lounges nearby but the noises were quite disturbing as there were no proper soundproof. I was up until 2-3am for outside to be quiet enough so I could fully rest. 

Despite its great advantage of its location, I could not stand the bathroom and dusts in the house, I decided to move out on Sunday which basically I stayed for 2 nights only. This may be suitable for a single, couple, friends or family without child.

2019-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,20374683,Claudia,Phan was a very nice host. She was always concern in making us to feel at home. Everything was clean an tidy. The apartment is perfect for a big family or group. The location is very good.

It's super convenient (museum station was a 10 min walk) and there are heaps of buses to various beaches. It's also close to shops and convenient stores. Nicole wasn't in town during our stay but she put me in touch with her friend who was very helpful during our stay. We highly recommend this place!"
2018-07-06T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Stacey,"The manly escape is exactly as pictured, a very clean compact apartment. Ziggy greeted me on arrival and showed me around the building, its in a great location in Manly. I have mobility issues but i was able to walk everywhere i needed to, its minutes from the wharf and the local Hop on Hop off bus which is something i used everyday. Manly escape was the perfect base, tea and coffee were provided as well as basic pantry staples. In the bathroom Ziggy is very generous with the white fluffy towels and bathroom staples. Thank you so much for a lovely secure place to stay, loved the view from the balcony too!!"

Belinda was an excellent host, her garden studio is just as it looks in the photo, spotlessly clean and we especially loved sitting on the verandah soaking up the peace and quiet. Belinda was kind enough to pick us up at the ferry when it was raining on our arrival and had even provided milk in the fridge, tea, salt, pepper etc. Her thoughtfulness was most appreciated. Thanks Belinda, you have set the bar very high for our future Airbnb stays.       "
2016-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Dai,Convenient location. Very close to the airport and just $10 uber ride. The key got stucked the first time I used and the host help us to get it asap. It was lovely to have a short stay here.

The real life experience exceeded far beyond my expectations. The place is located in the heart of Sydney: in the safe, clean and beautiful neighborhood, right next to the Harbor. The room is light, spacious, clean, and well-decorated.  I'd like to thank Suzie for her hospitality, it was a lovely stay! Thanks! "

2015-11-05T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Nick,"I stayed at Hugo's with my Dad while we were travelling through on a road trip up the East Coast.  My Dad was in the bedroom and I was on the inflatable in the living room. There was more than enough space for the 2 of us and Hugo's home was exactly as expected.  Beautiful, homely and fantastically positioned close to the centre of Sydney.  

We loved the art deco style of the building and how Hugo had furnished the apartment.  Hugo's communication was excellent through out the whole process and checking in and out was made seamless and flexible. The weather was terrible during our stay but fortunately there was huge range of fantastic cafes, restaurants and bars in the immediate area. Great location!

To summarise, I would absolutely recommend Hugo's place to anyone visiting Sydney and we're sure to be back in touch next time we're in town :)

Thanks for everything!"

The pictures portray the little studio perfectly. Plus, the little yard and garden area makes the cottage even more quaint. I highly recommend the Bronte studio if you want to easily access Bronte beach and also Bondi! We went surfing and swimming at Icebergs (only 10 minutes away!) Don't hesitate. Book it! (If it's available.) :) "

The bed is really comfy too. Perfect spot for a short stay, had all basic kitchen appliances but no cooker so mightn’t be ideal if you are wanting to cook. 
But for us it was great and more than we needed :)"

2017-03-12T05:00:00.000Z,13852692,Jason,"This place is perfect for few families and those with children! Plenty of space and not to mention many interest art pieces. Very Walkable to Luna Park, harbour bridge plus North Sydney train station and Greenwood plaza for all your grocery needs. Highly recommend for short or even long stay. :) do bring a clothes rack along if you have plenty of washing to do. Thank you Venessa!!!"
2016-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Ben,"As Phillip was out of town, his friends, Sally and Trevor hosted us during our stay. And they will fantastic! Upon arriving at the house, they showed us every single room and where certain appliances are. The house was just a 5 minutes walk to the Museum Station and maybe 3, to the bus stop on Oxford Street. It was only a few minutes walk to the 'Cafe Street' aka Crown Street and maybe 15-20 minutes walk to Haymarket. Our group truly enjoyed ourselves in the house, the filtered water hose was a huge plus!"
2016-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Yas & Andrew,"My husband, baby and I had a wonderful time staying at the cottage. All the baby equipment at the cottage really made our stay so much easier. We loved the easy access to restaurants and often strolled around the waterfront and darling harbor.  Bryan and his daughter are such great hosts! "

2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,9802077,Hallam,"I was in Sydney for a week for conferences at the ICC in Darling Harbour. Helena's place was a great choice for this -- easy to get around on the light rail, nice neighbourhood, and had everything I needed."

2014-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Stefanie,"Staying in Caths cosy little Garden Studio was absolutely wonderful. The Garden Studio is decorated with much love for details, clean, comfy and very charming. Cath was great host. I was totally surprised to see that she prepared a breakfast basket for us with self-made jam and eggs from her three hens. I would definitely stay there again if I ever have the chance to visit Sydney again!"
2018-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,21583732,Jesse,"Ellie and Kevin's home is fantastic and they are a very welcoming couple. The location is close to transport, shops and restaurants. I was very happy here as their apartment was really beautiful, very clean and the room I stayed in very comfortable. I could highly recommend anyone to stay there "
2018-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,9802077,Alexander,"Comfortable apartment in a quiet and cool spot close to the Sydney CBD,  with excellent transport access, great facilities and thoughtful touches. Had a very relaxing time during my stay!"
2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,1944996,Molly,Annie's apartment is a beautiful loft in a perfect location to explore Sydney. Annie is also a great host -- she was completely accommodating with check-in and came all the way down from Manly to greet us at the apartment. She also gave great recommendations for spots to check out in the neighborhood. Highly recommended!

2014-09-08T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Mathew,"We had a great stay with Hernan and his partner, he was very welcoming and let us use his place while away. The room is exactly as described and what the photos show. Within walking distance of train station and all conveniences. We would definitely stay with Hernan again and would recommend his home to anyone travelling to Sydney."
2016-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Olivia,"Such a lovely stay - perfect location with a delicious bakery right below the apartment ;) Very clean with chic decorations, we felt very welcomed and comfortable! "

The place was great, beautiful balconies, and location was perfect. Right next to the train station. Would highly recommend this place for travelers."
2014-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,888107,Samuel,Emplacement parfait calme et proche du centre. Chambre propre et appartement très sympathique. Wyatt est incroyablement accueillant très ouvert et on peut voir que c'est quelqu'un qui à lui même voyagé et qui sait donc exactement ce que un voyageur recherche durant son voyage. Malgré le fait que c'est une chambre dans un appartement on se sent tranquille et on à pas l'impression de faire intrusion dans la vie de l'hôte ni de se marcher sur les pieds. Thanks a lot! Samuel & Karolina
2017-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Jayde,"Michele place is perfect in every way. Michele provides every thing you would need and has created a space that feels homely. 
The bathroom is INCREDIBLE! Wish i had that at my house and the bed is extremely comfortable. 
Plus great location!
Would highly recommend this to everyone."
2017-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Martin,"Nice and clean, well equiped room and kitchen, shared bathroom, very easy check-in, check-out, great communication with host. Roughly 15-20 mins walking to and from the airport, less than 15 mins to trains to the central Sydney. All well! Recommended! :-)"
2018-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,888107,Paul,We stayed at Wyatt’s old villa over the weekend. It's located in a great place close to City. It was a great value for money.
2018-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,18082902,Jared,Great kitchen! Close to where I needed to be. Would stay again
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Margherita,"I enjoyed my stay at the Avalon apartment amongst the trees, check in and check out was smooth, and communication overall was appreciated. The location was great and especially for the summer time of year. The only critique was the front door and maybe being a bit sturdier, and that the surrounding area was a lot busier than anticipated however it was still a lovely stay."
2018-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,27716426,George,Excellent stay as per usual thanks again
2018-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,21999107,Carol,Great apartment close to lovely beach and easy access to Sydney.  Neil is great host and would definitely recommend.
2018-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,18083735,Maggie,"Cosy and great location , easy walk to some good restaurants. 10 minutes drive to Crows Nest which made getting to my work location convenient. Clean ! Great extras provided and very much appreciated after a long drive.
Will be back highly recommend!
Thanks Greg and Maggie for you quick responses and hospitality"
2017-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Gonçalo,"The place is really nice and clean! 

It was just what we needed for our last night in Sydney. 

The area seemed also quiet and relaxing! 

It is a very good option for you! 

The contact and checkin with shuang was really easy and they were really helpful. 

We do recommend the place! "
2016-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Elaine,"We stayed at Millie's place four nights and congratulated ourselves on a good choice, mainly because of the location. It is in North Sydney which puts it into a lower price bracket, but it is a 5-10 minute walk to the North Sydney ferry which takes you right to Circular Quay, which is the public transportation hub and next to the opera house. You can even buy your public transport pass at the little store next to Millie's. Also, the apartment has a balcony with a stunning view of the Sydney Harbour bridge and skyline. These things compensate for the apartment's tiny size and lack of air conditioning. Millie left us with a lot of breakfast food plus coffee and milk. The kitchen was clean and well equipped. The bed converts from a day bed to a double, and even if we had done it correctly it would have required strength and lifting. If you are not young and strong get her to leave the bed set up for you. The apartment is charming and clean but the public areas of the building, including the laundry room, could use freshening, but don't let that put you off. We would stay there again."
2019-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,24477058,Damien,Great place in a great location. Very spacious and very quiet!
2018-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Damian,"Great location, apartment & value. Just confirm that the elevator is operating when you book."

2017-09-20T04:00:00.000Z,20788503,Mishka,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2017-11-05T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Lynne,Great views of Sydney and the hosts were so responsive to our requests to arrive early
2017-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Melanie,We enjoyed a fantastic stay at Mackerel Beach with our friends and family. The house is small but beautifully appointed with everything you need. So very relaxing. Thank you Ruchard!
2017-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,16020247,Jeff,Great location and perfect little house from which to experience Newtown living! We had a great time and loved Kassandra's tips for local cafes etc. Recommended.
2018-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,22661818,Merritt,"We had a wonderful relaxing vacation at Kate’s apartment. We didn’t have  a car and didn’t need one. The beautiful beach is across the street. We walked to supermarkets, restaurants and shopping. The bedding is amazing. It is one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept in. 
Kate was really patient with all of my questions and always responded quickly.
Thanks Kate!"
2016-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Cecile,Thanks for all. Your home is very nice and welcoming. Good location for traveller close to airport.
2018-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,22323221,Jules,"Agata was a great host, with very quick responses, nothing was too much trouble. Well worth it."
2016-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Ben,"Naveen and Tristan have a great airbnb setup perfect for someone who just needs a place to stay close to the city. They prefer guests don't use the public spaces or kitchen which is fine however wasn't mentioned before booking. 
They've thought of everything else one might need, we appreciated the beach bag tremendously! 
Would definitely recommend for people who travel independently. "
2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Joshua,Sarah was a lovely host and we had a great stay!
2016-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Calvin,"Location was very close to the airport and Hernan was able to provide information on how to get to his home by public transport. Took me only around 30mins by bus. Took me a some time to locate his apartment, might be a bit confusing for the first time. Location was near lots of food choices and the beach is just a 3min walk away. Bed was comfortable but pillows were a bit too soft for my liking. Host was very easy going and gave me my space at the same time was there when you needed some information. 
Really enjoyed my stay with Hernan! Would recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Sydney. "
2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,24360345,Pauline,Great place to stay and easy access to the shops❤️
2018-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,19238057,Thao,"The house is near Padstow station which is very convenient to get around and easy to find. The space was clean, tidy and organized. There was a heater in the room. The hosts were very responsive to messages and happy to help. A couple who stayed in the room next door were so nice and friendly. They also suggested some great places to visit. Would highly recommend."
2016-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Samantha,Rhonda was amazing! Honestly can't fault my stay at all.
2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Nhi,"I stayed here for a birthday weekend getaway. It was my first experience with Airbnb which went smoothly. The communication was timely and helpful throughout the stay. The phone reception /wifi was a bit patchy & there were a few creepy-crawlies which kept my friends up for a portion of the night (didn’t really bother me). Otherwise, we had a relaxing time; the space is cosy and beautiful as pictured, well-equipped, with comfy beds, in a peaceful location. We also enjoyed visiting the cafes and beaches nearby."
2018-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,20578419,Alexia,"Overall our stay was good, and the apartment is as it is represented except for the view has been totally blocked out. On my booking I requested the sofa bed but that was not organised, but the manager was good to fix we just had to wait till later in the afternoon and they charged extra. The wifi didn’t work and I had no response when I asked for it to be looked at. And on check out , the care taker came in before 10am asking when we will be out. I said sorry running a little late and the response was we have to charge you for 30min!! Unfortunately this was a terrible way to end the stay and also does not represent Airbnb’s hosting model."
2017-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Debbie,Handy location for travelling the city. Paul was efficient with communication and always willing to help solve the problem! Good stay!
2015-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Nick,"Excellent communication and kind gestures such as leaving Cadbury easter eggs for us in the kitchen one morning. Location is in a cool, young, hipsterish neighborhood 3 minute walk from Newtown Station, which was super convenient. The room is perfectly clean, The apartment itself has a lot of fun character and the owner has decorated in great taste that enhances the stay. Bed was large and VERY comfortable. I wasn't able to meet the owner, but briefly met the husband as he stopped by to welcome us. Seemed very kind. My girlfriend and I agreed that we have no choice but to stay here again if we ever visit Sydney again. We LOVED it!"
2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Anna,"The place is in the best location, close to everything. Very clean and spacious"
2019-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,16549021,Greg,Classic beach house at a great beach!  Beach is 1 block away.  Clean inside.

2018-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,22412815,Noriko,I borrowed it to spend the same time with many friends. Families with children also enjoyed it.    Thank you very much.
2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,18620288,Mel,This sunny one bed apartment is in a fabulous location .
2018-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Alyssa,"The apartment was as descibed, Alexey was a responsive host. 

There was something happening at Central Station in the wee hours that meant sirens were going off all night, and the construction in Chalmers St was noisy, but that didn't start til 9 am. The first night was totally fine, slept like logs.

You need to be ok with stairs and the mattress is on the floor. The mattress is a good one. The apartment has everything you could want, great kitchen and bathroom. It was handy having two bathrooms.

Being right near Central is great for transport, we got to town late and were still able to get the train to Circular Quay in time for the show."
2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Pingchun,The best choice if you travel in Sydney first time.Very good location and you can walk to Sydney maybe 40 minutes. Clean room and we slept tight. You can cook Chinese food since there is Chinese soy sauce.
2015-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Adam,"DJ was a fantastic host.  everything was as advertised, lived up to the other reviews, and he couldnt be more helpful.  I would absolutely stay with him again.  "
2017-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Kyle,"Great apartment, great location. Easy to get anywhere by foot or public transport. Incredible view from room or rooftop pool. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

2018-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,24863216,Genevieve,"Vivian's loft apartment is perfectly located, close to great coffee spots and transport. Ten minutes from the beach and the stunning Bronte to Bondi coastal walk- not to be missed. The apartment has beautiful fixtures, a fantastic bed and a great shower. We would definitely stay at Viv's again, she was a generous and helpful host."
2017-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Bowie,"The Apartment is clean neat, exactly match with the photo. and the view from living room is so beautiful~ but in the evening there is a little bit noise. And the location is very inconvenience!!!! close to Museum Station ( the train to airport ), walk to Darling Harbor 10mins, china town 10 mins, circular quay 20mins."
2018-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,22068048,Anna,"Immaculate apartment, spacious, clean, pretty outlook. Lucy has thought of every thing. Very well equipped kitchen if you want to cook and a dinning area inside and out. Lovely outdoor area. Comfortable bed."

2015-10-04T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Prani,"We had a really lovely stay at this bungalow in Clareville. 
It's generous, light and well-ventilated, with many highly appreciated details, including a delicious breakfast, kitchenette at our disposal and kookaburra visitors. 

Michy is a warm and generous host. We stayed for a long weekend, most of which was spent at the wedding of friends nearby (or associated events), so we didn't get to take her up on her offer of the use of some watercraft, but did get across the road to the beach a couple of times. 

The area too is worth a scout - a couple of early morning walks gave us a great survey of the widest variety of housing I've seen in one location, set amidst lush greenness and against spectacular views. 

We'd love to come back some time. The experience left us feeling very spoilt. "
2015-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Suhela,We recently spent two nights in Michy's backyard cabin and absolutely loved it. It is spacious and beautiful and decorated with love. the bed is  so comfy. Heaven! And the location and the area are unbeatable. Only a short drive to great restaurants too. water just across the road. I'm definitely hoping to stay here again.
2018-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Peter,"Comfortable and everything you will need for a short stay. Little beach opposite is walking  distance and very nice. 
The cabin faces the host’ s house and that makes privacy difficult."
2016-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Cloe,"Lovely apartment with the perfect location (only 2 mn walk to Kings Cross station), there's also a very nice walk to do from Potts Point to the Opera house through the Royal Botanical Gardens. Will definitely be back again! "
2018-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,20767798,Nigel,"Pros: Excellent location, clean and comfortable. Cons: A little bit of noise with the nearby construction during the day. No dishwasher if you plan to eat in. Shower would be tight for bigger people.
We enjoyed our stay and felt this place was good value."
2017-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Sue,"The location was perfect for our needs and the apartment was quiet.  The check in did not go well as we weren't told which apartment it was and the key had to be collected from another location over 1km away which we didn't know either until we got there, and had sent the uber off.  The listing says there is a key safe but they didn't use it for us.  The host wasn't contactable either despite calling the 24 hr number a couple of times and leaving messages, so the whole process took about an hour and a half.  The apartment is tiny and is more of a bedsit rather than having a separate bedroom.  This also made me wonder about the very expensive $170 cleaning fee."
2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Sherrin,"Had a wonderful stay at Angela’s !
Can’t wait to return 
Beautiful home with lovely relaxing feel 
Future guest will not be disappointed"
2018-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,23510317,Ester,"Jason's accommodation is in a very good location.  However it had a shabby feel to it, mainly due to the poor workmanship of the building."
2015-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Danielle,"Great accommodation! Very clean, well-kept, and atmospheric. MissD's husband was so gracious in giving us travel tips for our stay in Sydney. Would easily recommend this place for a pleasant, welcoming stay. "
2018-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Lucie,"We had a very good stay at Natasa's home. Her house is lovely, the bedroom is spacious and very clean. Natasa is a perfect host, she welcomed us very well and she is very generous. The house is very well located, next to public transport, we were 20 minutes from the city centre. So, it's a perfect location to stay in Sydney, thanks again !"
2018-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,5993432,Robbie,"This location is amazing, just 300m to the Kings Cross train station, and within short walking distance to pubs, cafes, and grocery mart.  The place was very functional, perfect for cooking my own meals at times during my 15 night stay.  The shower's water pressure was very strong and the hot water almost instantaneous (having a bathtub was a nice bonus).  The bed was very comfy with extra linens at hand, including plenty of large bath towels.  The oven didn't work nor was there a freezer as (both) stated in the printed instructions, but that didn't deter me from creating nice meals during my visit.  The portable space heater worked in a pinch when temperatures dropped a bit during the winter nights.  The unit backs onto a alleyway so not much natural light, but the interior lighting flooded the apartment nicely.  The apartment was very quiet, and very peaceful, just perfect after a busy day or night about town.  Check-in was a breeze, Ollie readily accommodated my early arrival and arrived seconds within my announced arrival on-site.  Ollie was very helpful, provided guide books in the unit and provided me with his own travel insight on places to visit in the local area.  Ollie was also quick to inquire about linen changes mid week, their laundering, including for bath towels.  Ollie was always just a text message away to offer any assistance when needed.  In summary, this place and Ollie as a host, made for a lovely hassle free 15 night stay in Sydney.  I definitely recommend this charming little place and I would return again.  "
2017-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Nicholas,"Wayne and Kate's house was everything we'd hoped for, and a lot more. The view is simply spectacular, the house itself tastefully decorated comfortable, and the little touches that make all the difference put the icing on the cake. You must stay here if you're looking for a little hidden beach oasis in Sydney's eastern suburbs. "
2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,24863216,Jenna,Vivian’s place is a homely beautifully styled studio and I couldn’t have felt more comfortable. She is super easy to get in touch with and happy to help anyway she can. Highly recommend her place!
2016-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Matt,We loved the apartment and would love to stay there again in the future. The location was great to get to the centre of Sydney and also the ferry system. The view from the balcony was amazing and the apartment was well equipped (even catering for emergency amenities). Millie was always on hand and very quick to reply to our messages. Thanks for being a great host.
2015-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Richard,"Beautifully furnished, spacious and well equipped house within easy walking distance of the stylish shopping and eating amenities of Mosman village. Well placed for ferry and bus transport to Sydney Harbour area.

2017-07-27T04:00:00.000Z,13302796,An Ny,"The house is next to Hyde park. The location is very good. The landlord gives us wine and receives us very well. There was a supermarket nearby, and we also cooked food, which was a good choice for family travel."
2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,17757543,Ephraim,Na looked after us amazingly. Made it so easy to stay here and at the same time completley private. We loved it.

2018-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,16964637,Sneha,"It was a great experience staying at Judy’s. The arrangements were just perfect. The room was spacious with ensuite bathroom and had all quick needed facilities in the room. Best thing was it is a laptop friendly place. The room was attached to a porch which again was very pleasant and relaxing. The kitchen amenities were great too. All utilities were rightly labelled. The entire house and the kitchen were clean. I enjoyed my privacy here. Also, this place is pretty close to the train station which saved me from long walks.

Judy was very prompt with her responses whenever I tried getting in touch with her. I would definitely opt for this place again for my next visit to Sydney."

It’s super beautiful, very clean and full of light ;) It is located in this quiet area of Manly and you have to walk a little bit up the hill , but the bay views from the bedroom are totally worth it ! Jackie and Matt are great hosts, very helpful and responsive. They made this long list with recommended places for coffee, lunch, dinner and things to do, see. I felt very welcome at their place and at the same time I had my own space. All in all, it was a great experience , I would totally recommend Jackie’s place to anyone who wants to explore Manly ! "

It's a lovely, peaceful place; incredible given how central and ideal the location is ! The area is the best in Sydney, just minutes from the best restaurants and cafes, situated right between Elizabeth Bay and Rushcutters Bay- perfect for pleasant walks along the marina. We loved it and would love to stay in Dino's place again. "
2014-11-03T05:00:00.000Z,1310308,Ruth,"The Apartment is in a great location, close to shops, and eateries. If you don't mind a downhill walk it is also very handy to the Ferry from Mosman. A small, comfortable apartment to stay in and well appointed. ( no microwave if that bothers you) . We loved our stay and it suited our needs perfectly. It was easy to organize with Mags."

2016-05-24T04:00:00.000Z,8559496,Xj_my2003,"I had an unforgettable time in Sydney. Staying at Tiger's place is such a joy and extra point to that. The place is right above the station, u don't even need to think about miss the direction. Taking the train from airport just 2 stops (I remember is 5 mins?), and walk downstairs to catch the train to city, circular quay, Hyde Park, Western area or north part of Sydney, and anywhere, you can't think of any more convenient. Woolworth is just opposite of the road, lots of cafe and restaurants just downstairs, which the place is located on a quite street. I'm very glad I didn't choose another place which looks also close and similar but is on a noise street.  Tiger's place is spacious, clean, modern and well organized. There are some flight noises in the morning but I didn't even notice. The most comfortable bed I have ever had when traveling overseas, of course my own bed at home is the best. :)
Tiger is a friendly funny man, he helped a lot while I'm staying at this beautiful. Thanks again, I'll come back again. Highly recommended."
2017-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Eva,"A perfect location for visiting family or friends in the Inner West.
My relatives were absolutely delighted - and told me to keep this address in mind for any future visits :-)
Top score in every respect, thank you Patrick and Christine."

2017-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,17028088,Lin Tai,"交通不太方便,除了步行或叫UBER去就近市中心購物就有点麻煩,希望地鐵快D建做好,但環境是非常舒適及寧靜,而房東就非常親切,回覆亦很快｡"
2018-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,21127680,Tristan,"Great spot in the city. Functional, everything you need for short stay. Good communication."
2018-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Lindsay,"Duncan and Ashlee's flat is in a lovely area of Sydney.  It is close to some lovely parklands going down to the waterfront, near the shops at Rozelle, the amazing Orange Grove market on a Saturday and has good links into the City Centre.  The room for one or two people is of a good size, the bed is comfy and the whole flat spotlessly tidy and clean.  I thoroughly recommend Duncan and Ashlee - they are great hosts.  "
2018-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,10091713,Kristie,"Wonderful location, spectacular views."

2016-06-27T04:00:00.000Z,928035,John,Simone has been a wonderful and attentive host. Her property was brilliant for our family stay in Sydney. The location offers great strategic access to both Coogee / Randwick life and transport links to city centre attractions. A great place to stay to base yourself in Sydney.
2017-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Fernanda,"The location is fantastic. Walking distance to the beach yet far from the crowds, loads of coffee shops and stores nearby.
The house itself has a great feel to it. Hope to come back some day."
2018-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Priya,Sams place is really nice and cozy.. was perfect for my family.. quite nice and central as well. Would be happy to stay here again..
2018-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Natalie,"What a fabulous space. This was a great warehouse conversion home. Victoria was great and communicated well. I stayed here with some work colleagues and it was a perfect space for us to have our own space and also socialise. Everyone said their beds and stay was good, there were just a couple of things that they were uncomfortable with and that's a couple of open windows and see-through curtains that looked straight onto the street, one of the rooms was clearly damp and the person who stayed there was sensitive to damp and mould, unfortunately. The common share bathroom facilities didn't have a lock on the door and the toilet door didn't have a separate lock so a few were uncomfortable with that. "
2018-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Manuel,"Hugo & Ollie's place is just perfectly located for exploring Sydney with the bustling Kings Cross just around the corner and lots of food and party options. And to top it all off, they are just the perfect hosts with great local tips and they make you feel really welcome. And definite recommendation for your stay in Sydney"
2019-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Christina,Compact and well located. A great place for a short stay in Sydney.
2016-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,7901220,Sandy,"Anat was a fantastic host from the very beginning. She was very responsive during the booking process and flexible with my family's arrival, which helped us greatly arriving in a new country. 

The house is a beautifully renovated 3 bedroom in South Coogee with tons of natural light and outdoor lounge space. The kitchen was well supplied for us to cook and bake, and we were surprised to see the BBQ was hooked up to the main gas line. Very cool!

We drove most of the trip, but there are also nearby bus lines that take you into Sydney proper in 45 mins or so. I highly recommend this BnB and am excited for all that have the opportunity to stay here :)."
2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Tianyi,"Comfortable and clean apartment, with easy access to famous spots in downtown.  although couldn't see Sydney theatre from the balcony, it's quite near. 

Looking forward to come back to Danny 's place again."
2015-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Megan,"Hubby and I loved our stay at Greg and Susan's B & B.  The cottage is private and surrounded by lovely gardens. Light breakfast provided was just right, delicious and healthy.  We really enjoyed being able to walk to beaches and great cafes.  Thank you Greg and Susan for your hospitality and the unexpected little touches that made our experience so enjoyable."
2018-06-21T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Alex,Ziggy was responsive and very helpful. He greeted me with keys and showed me how everything worked. The apartment was very clean and in a great location.
2015-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Birger Christian,We had a pleasant stay in David's appartment and it is a great location for exploring the city. The surroundings are very cozy with a lot of restaurants and cafe's nearby. The room was fine and clean and we especially enjoyed the adjacent balcony. David was very helpfull host when needed. We would definetly recommend the place to others. Lone & Birger
2016-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Lisa,"Margaret and John are the nicest and most helpful hosts I met so far.
Since I didn't have a car Margaret offered me several times to take me to town. She also helped me move all my belongings on the the day I moved into my new home. John and Margaret also took me out for dinner with their friends, which was a really lovely evening.
The property is very beautiful, there is trees everywhere and a lot of nice sitting opportunities to hang out. You can go for walks and do bicycle tours in the surrounding forest, there is also a river not to far away.
The carriage is a very special place to stay. There are so many unique, beautiful and old details and everything works very well (lights, shower, wifi...).
The kitchen is equipped with everything you need and Margaret had set fruits and filled up the fridge.
The bed is super comfy and even got warm heating blankets.
I would love to return to the carriage which was my nest for about a week. 
Thank you so much Margaret and John!

2016-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Alicia,"We had a great stay at Simone's lovely house. It is very spacious, the bedrooms all a nice size, living room, breakfast room and kitchen all easy to be in. The area out the back is also a nice little escape. We appreciated the complimentary bottle of wine and the equipment in the kitchen, which we used each night. The location is very handy, 20 minute walk to to Coogee beach for a swim, or bus stops so close for a ride into the city. Simone was also very flexible with the check in and the check out which made things very easy for us. So all good!"
2018-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,지은,"Close to CBD, very clean,very informative"
2017-10-18T04:00:00.000Z,1944996,Whitney,"Annie's place was in an excellent location. It was really easy to check in and she was very quick to reply. The building itself is secure and right in the middle of Surry Hills so as other's mentioned - lots of restaurants and bars. We walked most places and were able to catch the train and also the bus several times. The apartment did have most everything we needed. The only disappointing part was the noise. The building was going through renovations so they started working around 6:30a during the week and we could hear jackhammers. Also, the apartment is right across the elevator. Overall, we enjoyed our stay - just wish we could have slept in some days."
2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,24608152,Hayley,"Great location in Dee Why. Slow communication before check in resulted in the cleaners being there when we arrived, but that wasn't a big problem."
2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,소연,Linda is a Good host!
2017-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Mikayla,Such a cute place to stay at!
2017-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,9701620,Imogene,A wonderful cottage with plenty of room and amenities. Close to  what Sydney has to offer and with a homeliness feel for an extended stay.
2018-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Chelsea,"The location is superb !! The heart of Sydney!! Just 5 mins walk to Circular Quay Opera house. Many good restaurants around. it’s like a NY style apartment, lovely, sweet and quiet. Perfect for couple. Loved it! Will definitely visit again."
2018-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Martina,"The Sandstone Cottage in Mackerel Beach is just absolutely stunning. The architecture of the house, the choice of furniture, the high quality linen and towels around the house, the handmade ceramics, the collection of art and objects around the house, the outside shower, the list goes on and on. The house has absolutely everything you could possibly wish for. 
It's one of the most beautiful houses we have ever been in. It makes you feel like you have arrived in paradise. 
I can recommend this as a serious experience if you wanna have a teste of heaven. :)"
2017-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Gilberto,"Great place.  Nice walk to many places around.  If you want to walk to the city, it's only a 30 minute walk.  Very safe at night.  If you are a late sleeper, worry about construction waking you up about 8am.  Washer/dryer are great!  The shower head is awesome! And free parking!"
2016-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,Mark,Mal was a great host. Everything was ready and available in the apartment. Mal was also accommodating when I stayed an extra day
2017-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Josh,"Easy access and exit, room ok, clean etc. Probably would have put small tv in each room rather than large one in kitchen as chairs in kitchen not comfortable to sit on to watch tv. This would allow for different guests to watch there own programs. Otherwise, not bad."
2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Tiffany,Fantastic location with everything you need for a home away from home. We walked everywhere. 15-20 min Uber from airport. Philip was waiting for us and easy to reach if needed. Would go back in a heartbeat

2018-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Cassandra,"Alexey was amazing to work with. He worked to make our check in/check out times best to fit our schedule. He had wine waiting for us, which was a nice personal touch. Everything with keys exchanging went very smooth. He kept great contact throughout the stay. The area is right by the train station, at the moment there was some construction so parking would be very difficult to find. There is a cafe/pizza place and servo on the bottom floor which was very convenient. The apartment itself is very trendy, with a small lounge are, but bring DVDs to watch! The balconies were lovely, and caught the sun all day. "
2018-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Rebecca,"Vickie is an amazing host and the apartment is exactly as depicted - beautiful, central, well appointed and excellent value for money."

2017-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Lynette,"We stayed one night only - in at 8:00pm and out again early in the morning.  We had 3  adults and it was ideal for us.  It is a new separate unit behind the owner's house, away from the street.  Everything was easy with the owner.  We enjoyed our stay."

Communication with Wendy was great too. She is responsive and friendly. Location of the apartment is fantastic - 5 minutes walk to King Cross station, 30 minutes walk to the Royal Botanic Gardens and lots of food option around the apartment. The only issue we had was the cleanliness of the apartment."

There is a grocery store down the street and lots of good restaurants close by. It is a great option for a solo traveller or a couple who want to explore this amazing city!

2015-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,May,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The studio was such a smart use of space; easy to move around and access everything we needed. Spotlessly clean, gorgeous decor, and very modern too.

Breakfast provisions were scrumptious and generous. All the little extra touches such as the magazines and DVDs made our stay and we wish we could have stayed on longer just to relax a bit more. 

Will consider again for our next trip to Sydney."

2015-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,1131054,Andrew,"Our last minute stay at #84 was a delight, the experience was super easy from beginning to end and Sarah very responsive and welcoming. The very tasteful apartment was spotless and cosy at the same time, a real home from home. Woollahra we discovered is a neighbourhood filled with great shops, eateries and it also proved to be a super convenient part of town - for the CBD, the bays and also the beaches. Highly recommended!

Very central with everything you need at hand but set back slightly so you don't have to feel in the middle of everything if you don't want to.  Sarah has thought of everything to welcome you during your stay.  I loved the colourful plastic cups, bowls and plates for my lil girl.  Lovely kitchen to work in and great shower too.  Loved our stay here."

2019-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,1907162,Damen,"We stayed at Teri’s place with our 2 young kids - perfect place for families. Pool right out the patio. 2 minute walk to lagoon and kayak hire, 4 minute walk to beach. No need for a car (plenty of buses and easy to walk everywhere on the scenic walk path). Lots of good food options / cafes within a 4 minute walk.  Lots of toys /plates / cups for the kids made the stay great for our family."
2017-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,19508741,Matt,"We immediately felt relaxed & welcome when greeted by Tessa, and sampled some of her amazing home-made jam & muffins. Accomodation was very spacious & had everything we needed, 300m walk down to the Newport Arms for dinner, we had a great stay thanks Tessa & Rod"
2016-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,8130620,Ange,"Sara was a fantastic host.  Prior to our stay she was easy to communicate with, responded quickly and with no fuss.  Sara met us on the grounds of her apartment and showed us around on arrival.  The apartment was clean and tidy and in a great location.  We enjoyed our stay. "
2016-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,12370710,Rory,"Amazing location, snorkelling, surfing & gorgeous shelley beach right on your doorstep. Loved coffee at the boathouse and falling asleep to the sound of the ocean. Maria & Jerry are great hosts,very friendly and helpful. Their apartment is in a worldclass location. Stunning. Felt priviliged to stay there.I had a great time. Thanks guys,will see u all soon! X"
2017-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,1310308,Ingrid,"Mags' Mosman home is absolutely gorgeous. As a family of three is had everything we could possibly need. We were very comfortable and really settled in for a few months. This place is really more equipped for shortterm stays however.

The big, soaking tub was really lovely and the leafy, breezy outlet was beautiful. The proximity to the local shops, park and waterfront at Mosman Bay made life really easy. The ferry wharves nearby were easy to walk to and connections very frequent for Sydney. The bus was harder to get- but by no means impossible.

Balmoral beach is very close and we spent lots of time there. The bus stop to get the bus to the beach is a fair walk away- but worth it to avoid the nightmare parking situation in summer! Mind you- the drive isn't far at all, so if you get lucky that is the easiest option.

The walk down to Sirius Cove dog beach is lovely and the swimming there is not bad either. You can continue your walk along the headline all the way around to Athol Bay for even better swimming or Taronga Zoo entry.

We only had trouble finding a street parking spot maybe twice in almost three months- so that was pretty manageable I'd say.

The Orpheum Theatre is delightful and the shopping on Military Road east was great.

Beware there is no wifi, microwave or toaster! It's a bit like taking a step back in time. But we loved it all the same."
2017-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,15312988,Philipp,"Cindy is a wonderful host, I had an awesome time during my stay in Sydney! The place is close to Randwick and public transport and not far from the city by bus. "
2015-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,1321603,Peter,"Ann is a great host. We felt welcome. She is a local historian and gave us a great insight into the island. 
The place and location are good. We felt at home. We were very warm at night and it was quite romantic for us. 
We were on the island for other reasons and would recommend it to others, although I would say that it is fully priced. "
2019-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,23730118,Mark,The host canceled this reservation 35 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2016-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Bec,"Margaret was exceptionally helpful from when we first booked our trip! Even though she was away the weekend we were staying she organised for a friend to meet us and gave us all the information we needed before we arrived. She also left us fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as food for breakfast which was a lovely surprise! 

The railway carriage itself is a wonderful space and full of historical touches. It is easy to see that a lot of love and work has gone into the carriage and it truly felt like a home away from home. It was very relaxing waking up right next to the bush, and located a short drive away from shops and other bushwalks. We also loved getting to meet Margaret's dog and puppies! 

We look forward to hopefully staying at the railway carriage again in the future - perfect for a weekend escape from the city!

'Cause she is crazy about it.
For me the story was very interesting.

2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Safia,"I enjoyed the stay in Bondi! The location was perfect and super close to the beach and all the restaurants in the area. The tips and information provided was super helpful! The conversations were lovely as well! He only things I was surprised by was that It wasn’t as clean as I thought it would be based on reviews and ratings. I also wasn’t expecting to have additional Craig and Leonie which I would have appreciated being disclosed ahead of time or in the description. Otherwise if you’re looking for a low key, relaxed time then this is a great option!"
2018-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Jenna,"Excellent location. Just a very short walk from the beach and cafes.
Easy communication with the host. Excellent layout of the accomodation giving everyone ample space if they need it."

Not only did he have many recommendations for things to do in the city, he also showed me around some of Sydney's landmarks.  Traveling alone and this being the first time I visited this city, it was nice to have a locals perspective and insight to getting around town.  When I look back on my trip and stay in Sydney, I smile... Thanks to Wyatt for making it such an amazing and enjoyable visit.  WHEN I come back, I will definitely stay at Wyatt's place :)"
2017-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,14921505,Erica,Thanks for a great stay Bailey! The house was amazing and miss waking up to that incredible view! Would definitely stay here again.
2013-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Anne-Kathrin,"Staying at Gavin's place was our first airbnb experience and he made it very easy for us to feel at home... We really enjoyed our stay at his apartment. Gavin was always very helpful, gave us some advice what to see and where to go in Sydney and was always open for a nice chat at home. We even stayed at his place a 2nd time on the way back to Germany and it felt like coming home for us... :) If we should ever come back to Sydney, we would also be checking in for a 3rd time if Gavin is fine with it! :)"

2018-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,Mike,"Awesome spot with a host who is quick to reply and easy going. The location is the key here, it is literally right off the beach. It gets a little warm at night (we were in the peak of summer) but Mal had a few fans that were easy to plug in, which helped a good deal. Bondi is simply the best and this one wins with location."

2016-04-30T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Emma,"The place was clean and stylish and conveniently located for us - although it is in the 'red light' district, it didn't bother us - and if you turn out left of the apartment you get to some really lovely shops, restaurants and bars. Walkable to the botanical gardens, Opera House and the CBD."

2018-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Fozia,"Jeremy was an excellent host, and his terrace was absolutely beautiful. Check in was a breeze, and Jeremy provided lots of tips and information for our stay. Communication was very easy and quick. The terrace was very clean with a lot of character. You’ll find two balconies in this home with extraordinary views of the city. Furthermore, you’re only a stroll away from great cafes, restaurants, shops, and bars. My stay was with 5 other adults, but there would be enough space to accommodate 2 more very comfortably. We all had a wonderful experience at this gorgeous terrace."
2015-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Jayson,"Linda was very welcoming, made us feel at home in her lovely home.  Great location, secure parking, will definately stay again."

Nat was very accommodating with being there to let me in and show me around. 3 or 4 people live here but you would hardly know it."
2017-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Jacquie,"Evelyn's apartment is just perfect , its clean and tidy and nicely decorated. It is very easy to get about the Northern beaches from where the apartment is. The views from the balcony are beautiful and its wonderful to wake up each morning to such a gorgeous view. Evelyn is a fabulous host and she will go out of her way to help you make the most of your time in her apartment. Its easy to get around but its better to hire a car as it takes about 30 mins to walk into Avalon but once there, its a lovely little place to wonder round and to have a nice meal (we highly recommend Yoda if you like Thai food) there is a little bar called The Mill which is nice to have a few drinks in (Happy hour is 5-6pm). All in all we had a fabulous time and we defineltly will be going back .  "
2017-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Elliot,"The apartment is exactly as described and pictured. Check in and check out was simple and all communications were clear. The bed is very comfortable and the apartment is quiet and fully equipped with all you would need. It sits 5 floors above the shops, which means it only take a couple of minutes to get to either Coles or Woolworths and there are also a great cross section of restaurants and take aways if you don't feel like cooking. Secure car park is handy also. "
2017-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Pauline,"Hernan's place is perfect if you are arriving in Sydney or if you are about to leave.

2018-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,21127680,Ani,"Coffee’s space was nice and clean. It was nice to have a full living room, bedroom with a king bed, bathroom, kitchen and balcony. There is also air conditioning and an indoor pool in the building. Coffee was a very nice host and very accommodating and quick to respond. We felt very welcome. There is a washing machine and dryer in the apartment but during our stay the dryer wasn’t working, not the host’s fault. We didn’t mind but asked for extra towels and sheets since we wouldn’t be able to dry ours. She only brought extra towels. The only negatives were that we had to buy some of our own supplies that we thought would have been provided. There were only two rolls of toilet paper provided for our 8-night stay. We also bought our own paper towels, dish sponge, hand soap (bathroom and kitchen hand soaps were only half full), trash bags, and salt and pepper for our food. Even though it didn’t cost much to buy these extra things, we felt they should have been provided for the price we paid.  Overall it was a good space and we enjoyed our stay."
2018-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Cyla,"Paul and Judith's house is amazing and comfortable, the bedroom is quiet and charming. They were helpful with everything that I needed. The house is very well located. One of the best airbnb experiences I've had so far, I totally recommend it!"
2017-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,Claudia,"This was the first time I had ever used air bnb. Overall the apartment was great. Location was perfect with great views of Bondi beach. It is on the third floor, so consider this if you have a lot of luggage. Apartment could have been a bit tidier, but I think the turnaround was a little rushed - I assume that for the most part things are all ship shape. Our host left us alone, which was fine but a check in text asking if everything was OK would have been appreciated and thoughtful."
2015-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Carmen,"I spent a night in Newtown during Easter. Walked into a neat and tidy room with welcoming bunny easter chocolate on the table. What a delight! Room was spacious. Very comfortable (and fluffy) bed! 

Although D was not there during my stay, she was very quick with replies and made sure I had no trouble getting in to the house. Self check in and check out system very efficient and flexible. 

Newtown is a lively suburb by day. Cannot stress more on the extremely strategic location of this listing. 4km / 15 minutes drive into CBD. Walking distance to famous cafes (Blackstar pastry 5 minutes walk) and there's a map to nearby cafes and eateries in our room! Street parking was free on designated hours, no issues at all. 

In general, very happy with the stay. "
2015-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Peter,"Host was very helpful in finding the place, when I couldn't work out directions; room adequate; bathroom clean and pleasant, although shared; house has steep stairs without handrail in one section; great location, close to everything, public transport short walk away"

2014-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Roseanne,"Marcelle's house is clean, big and comfortably accommodates 8 adults. If you love reading, there are plenty of books in the living area and kitchen.  The beach is 2 minutes walk from the house and a grocery shop nearby. On the day of arrival, Marcelle was at the house to welcome her guests.  My fellow Rotarians enjoyed their stay.  I never got to meet Marcelle but our communication was easy and reliable.  She even rearranged the bedrooms to meet our specifications. The WIFI at the house functions perfectly well and I was enable to keep in touch with our team in Maroubra while in San Souci.  One can easily access the CBD by a short bus ride to the train station. I would highly recommend a stay at Marcelle's residence to Sydney visitors looking for a beach-side house in a quite neighborhood. "
2018-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,27009904,Raymond,"Excellent location close to the train station, only a couple of stop to the city centre, supermarket and cafe nearby, room and bathroom was clean, street parking nearby. Overall we had a good stay at Tim & Mel's. Highly recommended!"
2017-07-01T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Kathleen,"David's place is a perfect place with privacy and the amenities needed to make it feel like home. The restaurants and cafes are wonderful. The Saturday market was a nice surprise and experience. The location is very close to the Kings Cross Train station, making it a perfect launching place for a car free, public transit based urban vacation. The train station area is a little on the sketchy side with some hang-over adult entertainment businesses still present. But a short block away, the neighborhood turns into a rather hip, locals-only restaurant filled area that was nice to spend time in."
2017-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,1979960,Clare,"Let's start with the positives - this house was in a great location, close to pubs, restaurants, shops and amenities. And the beds were comfy. Now for the negatives - and there are a few. First, the house needs a thorough clean and paint: the walls are dirty, the carpets are dirty, the kitchen needs a scrub. There's no air-con, and when the heat reaches 39 degrees as it did when we were there, that was an issue. Yes, we knew that when we made the booking, but at least provide decent fans that don't sound like a jet engine taking off. The downstairs shower leaked every time it was used; the upstairs bathroom was ancient and needs replacing, and the bathroom itself had saloon doors - privacy be damned. The sofas in the lounge need replacing: one was worn, the other like sitting on a rock. The dining table and chairs were passable. The four bedrooms felt grimy; only three had doors, the fourth wide open at the top of a staircase - far from ideal. The towels were threadbare. Plus, with 8 of staying, I would expect at least 8 of everything: cutlery, wine glasses, plates, water glasses, mugs - there were not. We arrived an hour early and the house was still dirty from the previous tennants, with towels on the floor, rubbish in the property. When we came back two hours later, it still wasn't ready. The spare keys were not where they should have been. Jeremy showed up the following day with flowers as an apology and spare keys - but we had no vase to put the flowers in. This house COULD be great - it has the space for 8, two lovely balconies, comfy beds, great location. But it was far from great for us, and I'd say, until it's cleaned and refurbed and some of the money the owner is making is ploughed back into the property, you'd be better off booking elsewhere."
2017-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,1321603,Fiona,"Ann's place is unique, historical and a memorable place to stay.  We enjoyed the history of the house, the stories told by Ann and the very genuine concern for our comfort on what was a 41 degree day.  Breakfast was delicious and tailored to our needs.  Thanks Ann for a lovely stay."

2015-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Traci,Rachels place was perfect for accommodating various family members who came to Sydney for my daughters wedding. The bridal party readied themselves there and the decor enhanced the vibe. Locale handy although we did not really do any touristy things. Thanks Rachel for the beautiful flowers.
2015-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,6201263,Hsuan Jui,"The house is near Central train station and provides all amenities you might need. However, the room seemed not to be cleaned before we checked in. And the sound insulation was poor. "

2015-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Linda,"Our host, Linda was extremely helpful and helped to sort little issues that we had on arrival.   We suggested a minor improvement to her and she was happy to take our feedback on board.  The area was a little off putting at first however, once we got to know it and also appreciate the proximity to the CBD and the train station and also a very good pub across the road, we were very happy.   The accommodation provided all that we needed but to be honest we felt it was a squeeze for 4 adults.   Much more comfortable for just two.  Ideally located for walkers and very secure.  Internet access was good.  Linda provided excellent information about Sydney with lots of tour information, sight-seeing blurb and also lots of maps.  Once a booking had been confirmed, Linda provided excellent information for us to read in advance of our stay and all very helpful to make our arrival problem free.

2019-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,6361929,Bradley,Edi is very welcoming and I was very comfortable staying at her place. Interesting and easy to talk to with a very clean homely feel. Thanks for the stay!
2019-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,23222456,Rosalie,The location was great for us as it is easy walking distance to Sutherland shops and station. It is easy to find and there is adequate parking. The price is fine for what you get. The house is quaint but rather cramped for space especially with full furniture and a tiny bathroom/laundry used by the hosts and sharing guests.
2016-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Dianne,Paul and Luke were very responsive host's and the apartment is in a very handy location with so many great cafes and restaurants nearby.  The Kings Cross train station is only a few minutes walk away and its an easy walk to Hyde Park and the city.

The situation is very convenient, the walk to Kirribilli shops, Milson's Point station and the Nth Sydney ferry was only minutes.  It was wonderful looking at the view over to the Harbour Bridge.  Millie met us on arrival and explained details of her place which was very helpful."

2016-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,12098138,Zosha,"Lizzy was the best host, and we fell in love with her beautiful home in the best spot in Sydney.  
Her home is beautifully equipped with everything you need for a beach holiday, and Lizzy is just downstairs if you need anything. Tamarama beach is literally a 2 minute walk, and our kids spent a lot of time playing in the grassy patch if they weren't catching waves! We have had the best holiday and will definitely be back.

Very cozy, would definitely recommend to others!"
2018-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,22530493,Patricia,"This place is amazing. It's just 1 minute walk to the bay and 500m from the very nice restaurants at Lyons Road.

Just a few things to note, I did experience a late check-in, waited an hour plus, for the host's Friend to pass us the keys to the apartment. Also pls remember to park in the designated lot for the unit. Roads can be quite dark at night, But other than those above, it was a very nice apartment to stay in. We enjoyed it very much."

2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,Natalia & Ryan,"The apartment is located in a great neighborhood, very close to the train station. The separately balcony is really great and a nice place to spend time on a sunny day or warm night. Kath was a very welcoming host and her dog was very friendly as well! There were a few slight inconveniences, like not being able to use the bathroom from 8-10am while the cleaner was there on Saturday morning and sharing the bathroom with another set of guests, but overall I would definitely recommend the apartment!

2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,18338274,Romica,"The house is an older style, full of character and art, and Chinese (Website hidden by Airbnb) has spacious bedrooms and modern kitchen equipped with all the appliances,however we found the living area a bit dark, with no sunlight during the day. Another con would be only one toilet for the whole house.

The host is very responsive and happy to assist anytime.
Overall a nice stay, and would recommend it to the fellow travellers."

Would definitely stay again if needed."
2017-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,16964637,Karl,"Judy's place is a Boarding house with many bedrooms. We had the bedroom with the on-suite. There was no-body to greet us and another tenant helped us. We called to get two towels for us and then for toilet paper but found that the TV did not work and we could not make contact the third time. The cupboard with the towels looked a mess just chucked in. The fridge was full of food and some looked as if it had been there for quite some time. The kitchen floor tiles are cracked and dirty, the rubbish bin is open and we found some cockroaches in our bedroom. No one there to organise the house in general. We had better value."
2018-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,24858356,Nicola,"Natasha was extremely helpful and responsive to any communication. 
When we arrived there were thoughtful touches such as fresh flowers and a lovely bottle of chilled wine.
The apartment had everything we needed and was comfortable and very clean.
Natasha offered good advice about the area and local amenities and restaurants. 
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and found the apartment to be in an excellent position for visiting Bondi, catching buses and eating out.
The only slight negative about our stay was the noise from traffic and other residents chatting in the corridor early in the mornings which made earplugs necessary- however we realise you can’t have the convenience of being near to a bus stop and amenities without hearing the traffic noise!"
2017-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Craig,"I would highly recommend Fred and Bernadette's apartment, it is in a fantastic location with great views of the ocean and inlet. Lovely and clean with homemade treats and orange juice and milk in the fridge on arrivalwhich makes things that much more easier.
I was staying for work so i didnt get a chance to relax that much, but i would love to go back with my wife and take in all that Malaba has to offer."

2017-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,18082902,Tristan,"Cedric was extremely friendly and easy to communicate with. He even checked in on me on the second day to make sure everything was ok. The apartment was clean and was stocked with all the basic household essentials to be able to drop my luggage and relax for a few hours before heading to the closet shopping centre, Broadway. Close to public transport and the city, i would recommend Cedric's apartment to any solo or couple coming into Sydney."
2015-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Kat,Hernan gave instructions where to locate the key.  He made sure I was inside with no issues.  He planned to work late and told me so. Unfortunately we were never able to meet as he came home quite late while I slept. I woke up early to call Uber to get to the Airport.  Hernan did send an apology indicating he was sorry not to have been able to meet me.  I'm quite sad as I know we would have hit it off and had quite a bit in common.  Spice and Culture Foods!  And good Bier!  Lolololol. Cheers Mate!
2016-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,9223554,Agne,"Gayle is the best host you ever can imagine. She is incredibly kind, caring and easy going person who makes you feel like home.

Cath also was very nice helping us with some directions and printing maps for us, thank you for a very nice stay!

Very clean, quiet and excellent location near lots of cafes, bronte beach and buses to Bondi and beyond.  We had a great stay with Susan and her partner Greg who were both very accommodating.  We would absolutely recommend her place in Bronte and we will be staying here again on our next visit to Sydney for sure!"
2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,12740176,Eileen,Marissa's place is lovely. I was delighted to discover that there is a sea view from the main bedroom balcony and a great coffee shop and restaurants across the road. There is lots of space and great for a big family. It is walking distance to the beach. I would recommend this house highly.

2015-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Ian,"The beachside apartment turned out to be a great choice for us. Bernadette and Fred were a delight to deal with. The apartment was lovely and beautifully sited next to the beach and brilliant for getting into Sydney as the bus stops literally outside the door. This gave us a great start to our Australian holiday and we would recommend it 100%. Thanks Bernadette and Fred!

2017-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,8106459,Gina,"Brenda's place is wonderfully furnished and gives off a very homely vibe. The beds were comfortable and all the amenities were working well. The place is located in a nice suburb very near to coogee beach. Supermarkets, convenience stores and eating places were also within walking distance.

It's also a convenient location to stay in as many buses around the area bring you to the city center and other explore-worthy suburbs such as Surry Hills.

Brenda was very communicative since the time booking was made till we checked in and the days we were there. She is a very hospitable host and me and my group of friends really enjoyed staying there.

Would not hesitate to recommend! "

House has a lived in, comfy feel with dozens if not hundreds of books on several bookshelves. Access was quick and easy and Marcella was easily contactable for all our questions. Internet is not blazingly fast but was more than sufficient for our needs."

2018-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,27479560,Jac,Spotlessly clean and modern accommodation not far from the beach. Quiet location and ideal for getting away from the hustle and bustle but only a short drive to shops and cafes etc.
2018-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,20578419,Peggy,We enjoyed the fact that the apartment was close to everything that we needed and public transportation.

Quedamos totalmente satisfechos y lo recomendamos!"

The location is perfect, there’s a grocery downstairs and it’s very accessible to bus stops which made our trip easier. The kitchen is complete with appliances and utensils. The only thing we noticed during our stay was whenever we enter the apartment, there’s an unfamiliar smell. I would recommend an aircon in the bedrooms since the living room is the only room that has an aircon especially during the summer days. All in all, our stay was great. And we will definitely recommend it to others."
2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,13333143,Georgie,"Ziggy’s place was great! Very clean, quiet and fantastic location right in the center of town and minutes walk to the beach. Would stay again."
2016-02-29T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Aurélie,"I couldn't have dreamed of a better place for my stay in Sydney. The room is exactly as described, spacious and clean. The shared space is also clean and convenient. The kitchen is very well equiped and there is a charming terrace to chill out. Natasa, the host, is a wonderful person: kind, always helpful and very funny. I had a great stay in this place! Thanks Natasa and see you soon. "
2013-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Deborah,"Simone was extremely helpful and thoughtful.
It was so good to not have to move out until Sunday afternoon when our flights left.
The accommodation was very clean and spacious just perfect for the 4 of us plus a baby. It was so good to have a garage too.
It was perfect location to walk to bus transport and cafes and supermarkets.
We would stay there again."

2017-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,10423504,Matthew,"Cat's place was great. Pictures just as it was in reality. Also very repponsive and felxible in terms of numbers of people that we were being charged for, even reducing the original price we paid because 1 person couldn't come. Also allowed flexible check in and out times which was very helpful."
2017-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Darcy,Great space and great location for driving through Sydney.

The location was great, Clare was great, she let us check in at 8 in the morning as we had an overnight bus from Melbourne! Stay was above and beyond our already high expectations :)."
2015-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Sarah,"Spontaneously, I arranged for a dear friend who was visiting from NZ to stay on a Saturday afternoon to stay at Michy's cabin on Sunday night! It was smooth and simple and my friend had a glorious time and now I can't wait to try it!! Must book again so I can experience it for myself. Thanks for being so flexible and spontaneous with us xx"
2017-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Laura,"Convenient location, tidy and comfortable apartment. "
2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,22165464,Matt,"Location was brilliant, parking easy, undercover and secure. The balcony is large. We really could have used an air-con during our stay and the place does not have one. It has 2 portable fans, but that was not enough to beat Sydney's summer heat. For everything else the place was OK."
2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,19846740,James,Will and Rachel were amazing. So helpful when we lost our car keys. We didn’t have kids but this is the best place for kids under 6.
2018-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,20865085,Mark,"What a lovely, stylish space.
Spotlessly clean, stylishly appointed with modern appliances.
Ample space, bathroom a little tight but totally satisfactory and shower i (Website hidden by Airbnb) quite roomy which is the main factor. 
The BB is elevated with screened windows that can open to let the sea breeze and the partial sea views in.
Excellent location, few minutes walk to Bronte or Tamarama Beach, (personally our pick of the Sydney beaches).
Jenny is a wonderful host, and  has taken great pride in the way she has set up her BB.
Happy to help though never intrusive.
Would we return?
In an instant!
It was a pleasure to meet you Jenny.
Thanks for providing a lovely and much needed break.
cheers,
Mark and Leigh."

2016-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,6033723,Min Soo,"Although I have arrived later than I initially confirmed, Jonny kindly left keys for me to get into the accommodation without any hassle. The house was tidy and comfy. Also the best location if you want to enjoy Manly beach."
2019-01-24T05:00:00.000Z,23510317,Kelly,"I had stayed at this place for three weeks for work. This is a great place to stay short term. David and Jason are very responsive and make checking in and checking out easy. However, I would not recommend staying here long term during the summer. There is not a fully installed aircon- it is a portable fan/aircon which doesn't really cool the place too well, especially on the warmer days. Jason did purchase and install two fans for me during my stay though, which I greatly appreciated.
Also, the shower head does not really work and sprays out minimal water. Otherwise this is a good  place to stay at during the winter or cooler days for a weekend. The place is nicely decorated and comfortable and is in a great location."
2018-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,14223095,Neil,"Lovely host , great position , very clean , convenient and as described ."
2017-05-22T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Belinda,Jared & Diana were fantastic to deal with and accommodating with our request.  The location is central to everything you need at Rouse Hill.  A very pleasant experience.
2018-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Alison,We had a great stay at Vickie’s apartment. The location is central and there are plenty of nice places to eat and also a supermarket across the road. Vickie was very helpful in messages as unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to meet. I would definitely stay again!
2017-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,Michael,Perfect location for Manly. Very comfortable and Anita was very accommodating. Highly recommended.

Thank you  again to Cindy & Miki :)"
2016-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Abi,"This was a sensational experience from start to finish. Desireé was exceptionally communicative and helpful, across arrival instructions and helpful hints, to being extremely flexible with my check in and departure times from the property. She was wonderfully generous with items left in the fridge for me to help myself to, and even some lovely fresh flowers for me on arrival. It's a gorgeous apartment right in the hub of the city BUT with the bedroom double glazed I had some of the best nights sleeps here I've had in ages. Terrific stay. Best part? Uber wide screen Tv and free NETFLIX! I loved this apartment. Don't hesitate to book."
2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,26934151,Sheena,"We had a great stay at George's place. He was very prompt in his responses. Loved his tips for good restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood. The apt is very cosy, clean and comfortable. It's perfectly located in the central with easy access to the metro. Total value for money."
2018-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Toni,Marcella’s home is lovely. Our social group have now stayed there twice and very much enjoyed it. Everything is so convenient and the location is brilliant.

2015-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Bodo,Naveen's place was awesome. Near Kings Cross and in 20 min walking distance to the CBD. Having a little dog in the apartment was a nice plus :) .

2016-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Niall,"Excellent location and only one stop from central train station. One thing to note is that the front door of the flat is permanently left open, only secured by a mesh security gate which poses a slight security risk. This is due to the kitchen, living room or bathroom not having any windows, and needing additional circulation. Check in only offered before 8am or after 6pm which was inconvenient."
2013-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,1143151,Juha,"Compact, well-appointed and equipped flat in top location, near public transport and shops. Eleanor is a very responsive and helpful host too."

2015-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Danni,"Loved Linda's apartment! Linda provided all the information before hand so checking in was a breeze, and she even let me in early after a long haul flight, infinitely appreciated! The location is amazing, there's some lovely cafes just across the road and the train station a small walk away. The apartment was really quiet at night and felt very safe. Would definitely recommend and would stay here again!"
2016-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Sarah,Lina and her family were incredibly helpful and friendly. The unit was spotless and all the facilities were excellent. I had my 18 month old daughter with me and it was ideal for our week long visit to Sydney. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Lina for your hospitality.
2017-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Carol,"Our stay was fabulous. Location is great, near everything. The apt is clean and exactly as described. Unfortunately the pool was being worked on the 6 weeks we were there   Would highly recommend it!"
2014-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Matt,"Fred was nice enough to give me a quick tour of the unit and was very friendly and helpful.  The apartment was nicely appointed, very spacious, very comfortable, and the kitchen is literally brand new.  There is a gorgeous sitting area in the front of the apartment with views of Long Bay that is drenched in morning sunlight.  

The bed and linens were all clean and very comfortable and generous amounts of soap and towels (as well as beach towels) were provided.  Malabar is a fantastic quiet community out of the hustle and bustle of Sydney that I spent the most time in and enjoyed the most.  I highly recommend checking out Little Bay as well as a fantastic swimming or snorkeling place.

Can't say enough good things about the hosts, property, or location.  Would stay again without reservation!"
2017-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Lesley,"The apartment was exactly as described. Very near to train stations. Main attraction were easily accessed by one or two stops on the train. It is walkable if you can handle a walk in the heat. The bed was super comfy. Nice small clean kitchen. Free wifi with good signal strength could stream Netflix to the TV. Iron, hairdryer towels were all supplied. Even toiletries and some food items were provided. Helpful instructions on the local area and tips on where to go. First time air bnb and was very impressed.

The host pick us up from the seperate car park and drove us to the apartment and back the next day, also pick me up and drove me back to grab my wallet that ive forgot which he didnt need to do. Best host in the area and definitly would come back. He has gone above and beyond what we expected and pay for the worth."

2017-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,501382,Susan,"Just spent a comfortable couple of nights at Louise's spotlessly clean, modern apartment. Everything was exactly as described, the TV is huge, the bed is extremely comfortable and the kitchen has everything you could need to whip up any sort of meal. I hired a car and was able to park easily close by, but the busses are also frequent. The bathroom has a great shower head, and there is a washing machine if you need to do any washing. Louise responded promptly to any messages, and was friendly and helpful. It is on the third floor, so there are stairs to climb, but it does mean that the flat gets a lovely breeze. A 100% positive experience. Thanks again Louise"
2017-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Aimi,"Conveniently located and the host was impeccable. Couldn't have found a more accommodating person if I tried too. Comfortable living space and had some good snoozes while on holiday. Thank you again, A! :) "

The apartment is basically fully equipped with whatever needed, nice view of sydney skyline, close to bus station,plenty of restaurants nearby and fast wifi. Communication with Helena was fast, she replied most of my messages almost instantly and she's kind enough to meet me earlier for me to check-in. A place I would definitely recommend to others if you would like to have a complete home away from home experience. "
2018-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Christopher,"Paul's place was very convenient for getting us around Sydney.  He and his wife were happy to speak with us and help us out as needed, including use of their washer which was much appreciated.  We highly recommend staying with them.  

Only issue that jumps out for folks to be aware of is that the room is up two flights of stairs, so if that might be a problem for you, be aware.  This wasn't a problem for us."

She communicated clearly about the arrival time and gave us great advice about the city. She also checked in regularly to ensure we were enjoying our stay. The neighbourhood is very posh, a less than 30 minute walk from the Opera House and Harbour Bridge, as well as the Botanical Gardens. It was easy to find from Kings Cross train station and we loved the modern feel and look of the flat. "

Tracy and her family are great hosts. 
The space was as described - the bed was comfy and the pool area was very relaxing. Could have stayed by the pool all day! 
There was a lovely selection of teas and some Orange Juice and fruit. While I didn't use much of the kitchen utensils - looked like there was everything you needed to make a nice meal if you were staying longer or wanted to cook.
The location is beautiful - easy to walk by Narrabeen lake. Tracy was very flexible and welcoming and easy to communicate with. A very easy experience overall.

2016-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,13302796,Scott,"Great spot but a bit basic in facilities and furnishings, but that's reflected in the price compared to the updated rooms offered by the resort. Could do with some updating of the property, paint, flooring etc and décor.
The property was clean and the host was nice and easy to communicate with.
Probably not for me next time but if you don`t mind it a bit ""rough around the edges"" then you cant beat the location."
2016-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Nicole,"We had a fantastic family reunion trip staying at Heidi's home. She was extremely accommodating letting us stay at the last minute and also letting us extend our check-out when some family members took ill. 
Heidi has a very welcoming and comfortable house which is obviously a well-loved family home. The pool and back garden were amazing. Towels, linen and all appliances etc. were all in great condition. 
We really couldn't have asked for any more! Thank you so much, Heidi"

2015-09-08T04:00:00.000Z,2838442,Justin,"Rhonda welcomed me into her home with open arms from the very start. She went above and beyond to make my stay with her truly an unforgettable one. I felt like I found a home away from home when staying in her granny flat. She is a very kind woman who will make you feel comfortable and at peace when staying at her home, giving you a chance to really experience what Australian hospitality is truly like. She was helpful in guiding me towards the shopping center as well as highlighting the bus schedule for me, which definitely came in hand. I can't say enough about her and the willingness of help she gives. Whether it's locating sights to see, helping with jobs, or just making you feel safe and at home while staying with her you cannot go wrong choosing Rhonda when looking for accommodation. The area is pleasant, quite, and beautiful. It's very close to the shops and train station, there is also a bus stop outside the house across the street. Not only is Rhonda a gem but her son is very kind and helpful as well. Honestly if you're going to stay in the Shire of Sydney, Australia and you want to save cash doing so while getting a remarkable aweinspiring experience Rhonda's lovely granny flat is the way to go. Trust me you will not be disappointed."
2018-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Nicole,Great location and good value for money. Paul’s an awesome host and communicates quickly about anything you might need. One of our fav Manly stays

2017-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,12256344,Chris,We had a great time here. It is far closer to the CBD than we anticipated so being able to walk to the Opera House on our first night in Sydney was an added bonus. If you're up for the walk Paul knows a lot about the city and gives great advice on how to get about.
2017-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,9415438,Liz,"I had an absolutely lovely week staying at Bj's comfortable home. The room itself was nicely equipped, with a comfortable bed, and plenty of space. I really enjoyed the little balcony too. I LOVED the neighborhood of Surry Hills too - so many cute shops and restaurants a hop away. Bj was super responsive and accommodating. I highly recommend a stay at Bj's home!"

Equipped with everything you need, and close to plenty of good bus routes.
A bit chilly in this very cold spell of winter, but there are a couple of portable heaters."

2016-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,2889953,Amy,"I had an amazing Airbnb experience at Jyoti' house! Her family welcomed me with an open heart. Not only they picked me up from the station and invited me for dinners, they truly cared about me. I felt like home! The room is bigger than the picture looks, the house is located 3 mins walking distance from the market place and bus stop. I basically had the guest bathroom to myself, I certainly had a lot of privacy. It was such an amazing experience! I highly recommend this place for both a short and long term stay near by Olympic park. "

2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Rebekah,"Perfect accommodation in one of the best locations. We feel very lucky to have come across such a beautiful spot like this one and at such a decent price. My husband and I always stay in Potts Point/Elizabeth Bay when in Sydney but always spend more money than we'd like on accommodation. Mariana's spot will definitely be our go-to for future trips: it has everything you need and was incredibly clean. The bed was so comfortable and my husband couldn't stop commenting on how great the shower was! ""That was one of the best showers I've ever had. I think it's the shower heads. We need to look into shower heads like these..."" 

For those who have never been to Sydney, the accommodation is close by Kings Cross station which will take you anywhere you need to go in the city, but there are TONS of great coffee shops and wine bars right outside your front door. Elizabeth Bay is beautiful, a short walk away, which is worth a visit. Perfect place to sit with your morning coffee. My husband and I had a great time.

Checking in was seamless. Mariana was the perfect host and very kind. She let us know about something we left behind which was sentimental and made plans to get it back to us. This thoughtful gesture proves what a caring host she is! We can't recommend this place enough!"
2018-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Elisa,"Clean and stylish place.  Very comfortable stay!  Wendy was terrific in her communication and check-in.  We stayed here at the end of our trip, and it was very convenient to the airport."
2015-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,John,"As description by Cath in her profile, everything is what you see in the picture and the place is amazing clean, neat and tidy. Was pleased to find that the place very cosy and quiet which is a plus point to me. 

Not forgetting her lovely pet dog, he was super friendly and obedient which i enjoyed so much playing with him even though he has enter the room without notice. :) 

It's a shame Cath place was taken up when i return to Sydney but will surely choose over her place if i ever return to Sydney for holiday. 

Thanks for the host Cath.   "
2017-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,5224098,Andrew,"Tam's apartment is in a great central location close to everything.  He obviously really cares about the aesthetics of his home and everything was clean, in good condition and I felt very comfortable.  Great communication too, made my trip a breeze.  Thank you, will come again. "
2016-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Sue,This is a great location (very central) and the room was clean and tidy.
2018-07-01T04:00:00.000Z,24874349,Masato,really nice place
2018-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,5224098,Paul,"I have stayed in many Airbnbs before and always rented the whole apartment or house. This was the first time that I stayed in a place where, from the sheer amount of personal belongings, I had the impression that the apartment is inhabited when not rented out. The result of this is that every cupboard, wardrobe and drawer is full of personal stuff. Not really what I wanted or expected. I do not have a problem with this but it would have been good to know. The photos do paint a good picture of the apartment but what they don't show, and the listing does not clarify, is that this is a ground floor apartment in an old building, with no blinds/curtains, that backs onto an alley way (with bright street lighting) that forms an entrance way into the high school next door. On weekdays, it can be noisy as the kids arrive/depart the school as well as during the break times. 

On a positive note, Tam is a great host and very communicative. He immediately worked to darken the bedroom for me (thanks Tam!) and is very conscientious that his guests are comfortable. The bed is extremely comfortable, towels are soft and fluffy and the location is second to none. The shower is also very good. 

Value for money? This is Sydney and an awesome location but it felt somewhat overpriced.

Cons:
Cluttered, no blinds on windows, ground floor apartment that backs on to school entrance way, pricey

Pros:
Great mattress, shower and towels. Amazing location"
2018-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Alex,"The cabin was absolutely fantastic and very comfortable. Loved the bed and we both had the best nights sleep. The location is nice and quiet, perfect for a stay on the beaches."
2019-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,24858356,Mitchell,Natasha was a great host. She stayed up extra late on Friday evening to greet us on arrival from the airport and to show us around the apartment.  Was happy to give us some local info before arriving and put us in contact with hair dressers etc for a wedding. Also loved the wine and food left for us on arrival. Also the biggest sell point is the LOCATION. 1 minute from the beach. 10/10 would recommend and stay again!
2017-05-14T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Mardi,A quiet and spacious room. Thank you Sarah
2016-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Jeffrey,Best Host ever... left my electric toothbrush and they delivered it to where I was staying next in another area.. nothing but Love.

In the heart of the city, close to transport, close to cafes and restaurants and walking distance to CBD.

Hotels are good, Airbnb’s are great!"
2018-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,24460520,Helen,"Nice, clean, compact space in the heart of Kings Cross. Bread, butter, jam, tea or coffee things were left for us which was a lovely touch. Thanks Julia!"

2018-06-08T04:00:00.000Z,24993202,Mark,"The place is amazing, with everything you need. The location closed to most of the sightseeing places and 2 train station. Mike always response within 10mins and give valuable response. We definitely will reserve here again when we visit Sydney again."

2017-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Katharina,"We had a nice stay in Vickies apartment, which is located in a cool suburb with lots of Cafés and Restaurants. It's a small but optimal used room.
Vickie was very friendly and easy to contact,Check-In and Out was very easy as well!

2017-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,20906161,Jem,"Alexey was a great host, very quick to communicate and has a lovely, small but split level apartment in an excellent location. It worked perfectly for us with a small child, we could put him to sleep and still stay up without waking him. We went to the park and the pool, very easily got around to the rest of the city."
2018-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,20767798,Kim,"What a fantastic spot- so close the circular quay and the rest of the city. Everything was super comfortable, plus nice and clean. We had a great stay and would definitely come back next time we go to Sydney"
2015-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Nicola,"This was a return visit as I loved staying at the Studio a few months ago. An excellent place to stay in Bundeena as it has a great location, ambience, amenities, privacy - all at a very reasonable rate. The hosts are very considerate."
2016-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Glenn,"Great location with cafes, bars & restaurants right on your doorstep. Very convenient apartment with room & bathroom next to each other. Arriving late was no problem and convenient access via concierge. Highly recommend for a business traveller. Felix the friendly dog came to say hello in the morning which was a nice reminder of home."
2016-04-27T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Osiel,"I spent a week at David's house. I must say this is by far and away the best place I have ever stayed. His house is very nice, modern decoration, very clean, close to bus stops, cafés, restaurants and a walking distance from CBD. The room is clean and spacious with a very comfortable bed, cable tv, air conditioner, a large balcony. The bathroom is very clean and the shower is perfect. Adapters for Australian plug is available in the room (although I had mine, I think it was very kind of him for supplying it to guests). David was very kind. I give this a mark of 10 out of 10. I would definitely stay at David's house again. Thank you very much."
2016-05-04T04:00:00.000Z,6046461,Fangwei Ivy,I told Suzie that this is prob my best Airbnb experience. Generally I had busy schedule in Sydney so I didnt spend a lot of time staying in the apartment. However every pieces of the furniture is absolutely amazing and they make the place so unique I think. Also I love the little budda in her balcony. My bedroom is very comfy and I have own private restroom!!! Suzie is a super nice host and I told her that I will def call her next time when I visit Sydney. Thank you so much Suzie
2017-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,17915093,Winston,"Super clean and close to the train station. Even though, Allen was overseas for the duration of the stay, there wasn't a single problem with check-in or communication. Highly recommend."

2016-01-24T05:00:00.000Z,9577071,Yoo Deok,"Awesome place!
Unfortunately I couldn't meet Jason. He was on vacation, so his friend Stu hosted us. He was just on time when we checked in & out, and very friendly. 
House is just like in the pictures. Nice living room with wide open terrace. The one of the best thing is there is a small park where you can oversee the Bondi beach in just 50m away. Also around 5min walking distance to beach.
The main room has double bed and empty drawers to keep things. And second room has 2 bed and 1 bed-like shelf.
There is no A/C (small room has small one, bue can cover the whole house), but in day you can open window. there is breeze so it is not so hot. In night, each room has fan, so no need for AC.
There is laundry room with laundry machine and dryer. Bondi beach is quite more humid than Sydney. so it was very convenient.
I'll definitely visit again with my family someday. This is perfect place for family. I so envy Jason to live this house:) "
2019-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,22268452,Laura,It’s not the ritz but it’s cozy and comfortable. Perfect for those of us that can’t afford the moon. Shaun was super helpful with suggesting places to see and is very kind hearted. Also the bed is very comfy! I had the best night sleep!

2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,15920870,Mikhail,My wife and I loved Oliver's studio! Very clean and modern with beautiful views of Royal Randwick Racecourse. You get to see the trainers take their gorgeous horses for their afternoon stroll as you relax out on the balcony overlooking a plant nursery and the racetrack. The amenities were great and Oliver was very quick to respond to any enquiries. The studio is located in very close proximity to a lot of great restaurants. We were very happy with our stay.
2018-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Adam,Great little 'treehouse' and not too far from the main town. Lovely little beach just a short walk away too to go and watch the sunset.

Love the room, the cozy bed and also the fresh air that comes from our 2 windows. The house has a good natural light, a wonderful kitchen, and a stunning bathroom. I also give Arnie a lot of credits for his artworks that filled most of the entire house. He is truly a fine artist. Lorraine was also a good host to us, very friendly and has a lovely smile. Thanks for the wonderful experience and sharing your lovely place for us."
2014-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Stephanie,"I enjoyed my stay here, I stayed here to give myself a break from the traveling back and forth from home during my time of my placement at the nearby hospital. There is no negative feedback that I can think of. I didn't see Hernan that much due my early starts and early nights, but in between when I saw him he was really nice. I will defiantly be back if I ever need to stay in the area again. "
2014-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,1145567,Marco,"Easy stay with excellent bus connection to the city. Shower was my favourite at this place, besides of that I had a good sleep in the comfy bed."

2014-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Galit&Alex,"Spectacular place on the colonial side, fantastic area with true Sydney spirit, nice and helpful host. Rather quiet, no street traffic could be heard. Good value. Highly recommended."
2018-05-16T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Lara,"Tracey’s place was fantastic! A home away from home. All the little touches such as breakfast and tea / coffee making facilities, decor, tv and the bathroom were great. It was close to the shops and the bus, so easy to get about. Would recommend to anyone. Will be coming back!"
2017-01-31T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Shirlee,"Arrange for transportation, my Uber App would not work so I payed $50 one way into Sydney.  That is not Shaun""s fault."

If you’re scared of creepy crawlies it may not be your best option, but we loved it nonetheless. Hosts were really responsive and helpful. Would definitely come back here if we are looking for a quick getaway from Sydney by the beach."
2017-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Desiree Ann,"The place was really convenient since it's just 10-12 mins walk from the restos, wollies and wolli creek station.  The room was relaxing, toilet and bath are well maintained and the kitchenette was good as well. "

The building was very secure and the apartment was just as described. Lovely view of darling harbour and an even better short stroll to enjoy the great restaurants and bars there. Looking forward to coming back to Sydney and will definitely stay here again. 
Great little pizza/pasta place just next door with beautiful, friendly staff."
2018-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,20865085,Cynthia,Jenny was an amazing host who provided our stay with all the necessities for us and my daughter. She was thoughtful to even provide toys for my daughter and ensured we were comfortable. The location was a huge win as we had to walk down the streets and we were at the beach. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Bronte
2015-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,1211285,Melody,"The place was very cosy and clean. The view from the balcony was awesome. It was a bit noisy at night as there were people driving with very loud engine nearby. Overall, my baby and I had great time in the apartment. Thank you Eduardo & Yvonne!"

2014-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,888107,Bolivar,"I stayed in Wyatt's house with my girlfriend for 4 nights. Wyatt is really nice host. This was my second time in Sydney and he recommended me good spots to visit which I hadn't seen in my first trip. He has a big painting along the wall in the hall of the house so we were asked to paint something in there. We really enjoyed it and we thought it was a really good idea. Regarding the room, it is really small, so there was space just for us and our small bags. Anyway our stay was short so we didn't spend much time in the house. For sleeping 4 nights it was good and I consider a great value for money. It is a better choice instead of backpackers. The house is cozy and well equipped in all areas. The toilet is shared and it could be a bit cleaner. Anyway it is enough for a short stay. "
2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Bruce,Susan was a brilliant host and the little touches in the room (e.g. Fresh flowers) made all the difference.

2017-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Mary,"Leslie's home is definitely one that my family and I would love to revisit! It was perfect for an intimate quality time spent with family in the basement studio. While noises of upstairs and neighbour's dogs was audible on occasion, it did not affect our stay. Beds were comfortable and we still got a good night's rest.  The TV entertainment and wifi access was helpful and the stunning views overlooking the sails is second to none!! Leslie's complimentary breakfast was exceptional and her and her family made our stay feel like home - if not, better than our home in fact! Thank you again! "
2016-06-19T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Damon,Hernan is a friendly and easy-going person and the room is clean and tidy!     It was definitely a wonderful experience for living here! :)
2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Isabelle,Paul was a great host. Great communication. The unit was ideally located close to wharf and beach. We travelled with 2 small kids. No mention of the flat being on the 2nd floor. A bit tricky with the kids getting up and down. The apartment was cosy and well suited to small kids to crawl around. However a bit dusty on the floors and carpets for the baby who was crawling all over the place. If it's a pad near the wharf of manly you are after this is it.
2018-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,19990097,Linda,"A great place to stay with very homely feel and room for a large family or group. Catered very well for our large group at great value. Host was very informative and provided good timely communication.
Easy check in and check out with no hassles.
Would stay here again."
2017-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,1211285,Terry,Enjoyed our stay at Yvonne and Edu's apartment. Excellent position within easy walking distance of Bondi junction and the train. The apartment was very clean and airy and we enjoyed the views. We found the bedroom a little noisy especially when the window was open. Great to have visitor parking in the basement and very convenient to drive into the CBD or to the beaches. Eduardo and Yvonne were easy to deal with and Edu met us on arrival and helped us up with our bags.
2018-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,17223695,Wendy,"the apartment is spacious and very clean quite location which is nice, the only down for is the bathrooms too small and needs air-cons in the spare rooms. 
We had a lovely time and Anita is a great host. We would stay again."
2015-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Ronja,"Wonderful apartment with a well-equipped kitchen! The apartment is close to public transportation so it is easy to get around. Hernan seem like a really nice and likeable guy, didn't meet him that much but he definitely had a good vibe.

Good place to stay, I recommend it!"

Bailey had stocked the fridge and pantry with a few of the essentials for our arrival, a very welcoming touch. Bedrooms and living areas were large and very comfortable. Tranquil location, with beautiful views of Pittwater.
Looking forward to our next stay at Bailey's place.  "

2018-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,21612973,Matt,Stay here when you go to Manly!! Jackie and Martin were the most amazing hosts. The place is very easy to access. Their home is a dream to be in. Would recommend their place to anyone first before staying anywhere.  They’re the best couple. Jackie even made me a tea brew when I wasn’t feeling well. Thanks again for an amazing stay!

Would highly recommend- thanks!"

The apartment it self is as listed on Airbnb. It's comfortable cosy and everything a traveller or holiday makers requires. My family and I also loved the area it was a nice quiet and safe area. 

If ever I return to Sydney I would hope to return to Linda's apartment. Thank you Linda for everything!"

Natasa is such an amazing person, so friendly, easy-going, helpful, open-minded and funny. It is so easy to talk to Natasa. She gave us a lot of advices and very good ideas during our stay in Sydney. The location is great if you want to explore Sydney. The train station is very close and it makes it so easy to reach all the places. Natasa's home is very clean and so cozy. Our room was fantastic and very comfortable. We felt like home at Natasa's place and we would stay there again. We highly recommend this place!  "
2016-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,6361929,Amy,"Edi was an incredible host. She was super friendly and helped us with anything we needed. She showed us around her home and gave us suggestions of where to eat, drink and do our shopping! The house was super clean, and our room was great (bed was super comfy) lots of space to put your belongings and Jet (the cat) was super cute! We ended up staying longer than originally planned because we felt so at home at Edi's. The house itself was only a 3 minute walk to the train station where you can easily access trains to central etc. I would recommend anyone to stay here and I would to stay again! Can't thank you enough Edi :) *****"

We were three adults and two toddlers and she had a baby cot and baby bath ready for us. The kitchen was also well-equipped. The apartment is neat and clean and very centrally located, some few hundred metres from the train station.
We were very comfortable at the apartment.
Note: One keycard to get into apartment so we had to coordinate a few times when doing different activities during the day/night, but it didn't really matter to us."
2018-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,1979960,Anna,"This beautiful home is perfect for larger groups. The living and dining area is spacious and comfortable. We had a group of 6 and really enjoyed the private decks and outdoor area. Wonderful location, so close to everything you would want for a Sydney stay."

2018-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Richard,A great little place and ideally located. Has everything you need and suited us brilliantly as a family of four adults. The city is about 30-40 minutes away by bus which between 7am and 7pm stops right outside the apartment. A welcome pack including fresh jam was very much appreciated. Fred and Bernadette respected our privacy but were there if needed. Thank you both.

Many thanks again Vickie for a seamless checkin."
2016-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Sally,"Cathy was a perfect host.  We had strawberries, muslie, yogurt and milk in the fridge on arrival.  The room and bathroom were lovely and clean, with a very comfortable bed.

Cathy has considered everything in the room, my mum and I were very comfortable there.

The location is also perfect, the area is very peaceful and would highly recommend staying with Cathy.

Thanks Cathy for a memorable stay! "
2017-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,14921505,Alfonse,We had a group of 13 and all had a great time there. The house was clean and well equipped from the bathrooms to the kitchen. The house was spacious and having 4 bathrooms between a large group was definitely handy. A few items including milk and soft drinks were supplied and left in the fridge which was a nice touch. Can't fault this house. We all had a fun and memorable stay!
2018-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,16029413,Eva,"The hosts went above and beyond our expectations in every respect. The place is immaculate and beautifully furnished, the location is perfect. Very close to shops, beaches, the national park etc. and with a nice view. I loved listening to the sound of the waves at night.  The swimming pool was a hit with my kids, especially the cupboard full of toys they could play with in the water. We were provided bathrobes, towels, extra towels for the swimming pool - felt really spoilt. We were a party of 2 adults and 2 children, but the place could conveniently accommodate 6 people. Hilde baked bread for us: what a welcome.  We could bring a dog, and were provided with both practical advice and everything our doggie may need. We had a wonderful stay, my children did not want to go home! Thank you Hilde and hubby for your hospitality. "

The studio was warm, clean, with lovely provisions. In the morning I found fresh bagels and jam on the step so I could relax and not have to go to the shop!  Walking to Clovelly and Bronte was a delight. We enjoyed breakfast in the Garden. Thanks for a lovely stay. Regards Anne and Rodger "
2017-08-30T04:00:00.000Z,18793287,Ming,"Really a comfortable house for the family. Very convenient traffic to the city and community nearby. Only 4 minutes' walk to Marrickville train station. The house is federation style with beautiful high ceiling, the landlord has excellent taste for selection of pictures, such as oil painting, Chinese painting, scenery pictures, make the house vivid, I like them very much! The facilities in the kitchen are all ready. The landlord is very communicative, thoughtful. The car can be parked alongside the street freely. By the way, there is a very good Chinese restaurant supplying Canton breakfast, tasteful and original, just by 10 minutes' walk."

2013-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,1098211,Katharina,"I stayed at Serena's flat for two weeks in July, it's a cosy little place, perfectly located to discover the city and the thriving night life around Kings Cross and Surry Hills. Getting around from here is also quite easy - the train station of Kings Cross is just across Williams St and you have buses all around you. The flat is in the basement so no views and it can be a bit dark in winter, but in summer it won't get so hot. The kitchen has all the basic facilities you would need for a holiday stay, the bathroom is neat and everything was tidy.
Contact and Check-in/Check-out was easy and prompt, with complementary fruit, bread rolls, jam and milk to start off my stay. There is an ATM right next to the entrance and a bakery across the street, so all very handy."
2018-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,17438054,Kiara,"George and Lucia's Granny Flat was amazing. It was clean, convenient and a nice home away from home.

2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,명아,"우리 부부는 Jared&Diana의 아파트에서 5박 6일을 머물렀습니다. 
체크인 하루 전에 주소와  파킹 정보까지  상세한 정보를 보내주셨고, 저희가 늦은 체크인을 했는데도 반갑게 맞아주시고 집안 구석구석  친절히 설명해주셨습니다. 은은한 향초의 향기와  센스있는 인테리어 덕분에 집안에 들어서는 순간  기분이 좋아졌고,  주방기구  세탁기 건조기 등 모든 것이 갖춰져 있는 곳이라  내 집처럼 편안했습니다. 또한 오트밀과 꿀 차등도  준비해주셔서 머무는 내내 든든한 아침 식사도 했구요. 주변에 호수 공원이 있어 저희는 매일 아침 산책하고 힐링했습니다. 커피를 좋아하는 저에겐 커피 머쉰이 없다는 것이 살짝 아쉽긴 했지만 길건너 커피숍이 있어 괜찮았습니다. 조용하고 한적한 곳이지만 Rouse hill town center내에 위치한 곳이라  woolworths나 레스토랑 등 편의시설이 모두 가까워서 편리했습니다. 아파트 자체가  완벽한 보안이 되는 곳이고  rousehill town center 자체적으로 24시간 순찰을 하며 보안에 신경을 쓰는 곳이라ㅇ 안전하고"
2018-04-20T04:00:00.000Z,22124796,Andrzej,"The apartment in reality looks even better than on the photos. It is very spacious, so it felt really good to rest there after entire day in an office. I especially enjoyed all the comfort furniture: sofa in the living room, couch and armchairs on the balcony. It is very clean and elegant. It has many different sized lamps, so it is easy to make it well lit in the evenings, whatever's your preference. Especially worth mentioning is the balcony. Even though there is no view to speak of, because the neighbouring buildings block it off as it is only 2nd floor, sitting on the balcony during the weekend or in the evenings was surprisingly relaxing. It is probably due to combination of the facts that the balcony is big, the chairs are very comfortable and the sound of the city is somehow dimmed after everyone left the city center. Speaking of which, the location is absolutely great, it is close to everything I wanted to see in Sydney: Opera House, Ice Cream, Restaurants, Offices, Cafes. And if you want to go there in a fresh shirt, there are very well working appliances in the apartment: washing machine, dryer, and a huge ironing board and a very good iron. I wish I had such in my home. Overall, I highly recommend the apartment."
2017-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Matt,David was an excellent host. Very helpful and respectful. The location was great and the home was welcoming and tidy. Couldn't be happier with the experience and service provided.

However, i am very disappointed about what happened here. After I went back to my home. The house ownner emailed me about several questions need me to pay. He mentioned about stains on the rug in the living room and damage to the rug. (I strongly doubt this point) and also mentioned the flat was not left very clean (We washed all dished, throwed all wastes and cleaned living room). We are still discussing about the repaire fee. Please everyone, be caution."

2017-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Zdravko,"Good location and nice house but not 5 star. Needed a good clean and there is no parking within the property. The adjoining property was being renovated, so we had to leave the house most mornings due to the excessive noise from a jackhammer. House had all the amenities most people would need and was very secure. Nice front and back outdoor areas."

2016-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Dariush,"Hugo's apartment is in a great location, walking distance from kings cross station, cafes and restaurants. The apartment itself is small and basic, a perfect crash pad if you plan to explore sydney and it's food and bar scene, but not a place you would want to spend relaxation time in. Hugo was very friendly and accommodating. "
2016-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,6046461,Carolina,"Suzie is a great hostess, very pleasant and ready to assist you if you need any help. Her apartment is extremely well located, within walking distance to the city as well as public transportation if needed. It is also lovely furnished and the room in question is very comfortable and spacious. I highly recommend it!"
2017-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Susan,"This small apartment is centrally located to everything we wanted to do.  With 3 of us, the apartment was filled but we weren't in Sydney to hang around the apartment!  With Woolies just down the street, we were able to get heat 'em and eat 'em food that worked great in the kitchen.  The downside was the 24 hour construction on the rail system on the street below.  Incredibly noisy, so if you are coming in the next few months bring earplugs.  The rail system will be great once completed though!"

2018-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Cindy,"Location is ok, hygiene is very poor, quilt is very thin, very cold, air conditioning only refrigeration, there is an electric heating, no use."

The appartment is very nice and just a five minute walk from the beach with heaps of nice restaurants just around the corner.

Sofa bed was comfortable, and has a little kitchenette which is ideal for staying a few nights. Bathroom is brand new and very functional given the size. I would certainly recommend Michelle's place to other travellers."
2018-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,23428550,Nilesh,"The location is close to airport(15 mins in car) and 20 min bus to Central Station, so not too bad, value for money. we noticed some bugs and notified Felix to take care of it in future. Also notified of noise making fans (there is no A/C). The bus stop to Central station is just outside apt, so convenient. The Woolworths is also close by, that was helpful to us as well. Not too fancy a place, but good value for money (except for the bugs and dust) for a night or two."

We booked Mags' place and liked it so much we booked again a few weeks later.

Mags was terrific to deal with. Great communication. Very accommodating. An altogether terrific host. We'll definitely be booking again for their next visit and would highly recommend Mags' place to anyone else.

Thanks again Mags

It was in a great location, walking distance to cool shops, cafe's and restaurants. The apartment was fully equipped and I never felt like I didn't have what I needed.

2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Erica,"We had an amazing stay at Paul’s place in Potts Point. The apartment was centrally located, and overlooked a beautiful pot with a fountain. The best part about this place is we were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go, and Kings Cross station was so very close for our farther exploration trips.  Paul’s place had everything we needed for our stay, and more, including a small desk work space! Everything was just as pictured. The full kitchen had everything we could ask for, and we were able to save a few dollars by cooking in - although the nearby amazing restaurants and cafes definitely drew us in!!! As some others mentioned, the street is a bit noisy, but it honestly did not affect our sleep at all! We were comfortable and thankful for such a beautiful recharging spot before our days exploring Sydney. Thank you, Paul!"
2017-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Zoey,"Very nice place, cozy and well-equipped. The apartment is close to shopping mall, Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney Opera House, Harbour Bridge, etc. We had a great time there, and we'll recommend it to friends."

2016-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,13852692,Kelly,"True to the pictures. The space was huge and more than enough for our family of seven. We loved that we could dine together when we liked in the roomy dining area. It was also a short walk down to a lovely Thai restaurant (Chet Thai), a little playground for kids, a small grocery store, and if you have time, walk down to the ferry point and you will be struck awe by the view of the harbour.

The planes can be loud and frequent at times, but were not so bothersome that we needed to close the window, and there is a curfew so it doesn't go all night. Angelo the cat is sweet."
2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,24916551,Rowena,Close to Train. Great price. Not a lot of utensils but quite enough for what we needed for our stay.  Would strongly recommend staying at Alice's place as it is nice and simple and clean.

Eleanor was a first class and friendly host  and her information book was a great help .Location was perfect -an easy 5 minute walk to North Sydney wharf - with easy access to Circular Quay and the rest of Sydney
The balcony with a view of Sydney Harbour Bridge, was a great and well used bonus for us 
All in all a great experience for us"

About the home, the living room and the kitchen form especially a nice and spacious open-space.

We truly felt welcomed and at home in Bronte Beach-- and would recommend your place to anyone visiting-- hands down! The cottage was incredibly comfortable and was the most magnificent starting point for jogs along the beach, brunch at the beach, and short rides into Surry Hills/downtown Sydney for sightseeing and evenings out. Thank you both for the tips and the wonderful hospitality!!"

Also very convenient to the beautiful precinct of Cronulla where you have some wonderful eating places & a lovely beach we did not get to use. This was due to our stay was not a holiday but a visit to a eye surgeon for our daughter.
Couldn't fault the home at all, would go back if required."
2016-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Jean,We spent à nice stay in Hugo and Pamela's apartment. The apartment well located was comfortable and pleasant with a beautiful view.

2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,18917022,Anne,"This place is not at all what we were expecting from the advertising.

It was so unclean (filthy stained carpet and sofa bed, didn't smell nice and obviously previously used bed linen for the spare beds) and small that we had to find alternate accommodation.
I'm certainly not a snob and I'm happy to camp but not one of us could bring ourselves to sleep there even just for one night.  So disappointed!  I have used Airbnb previously and was extremely happy with our choice.

Only positive was the great location but even that couldn't keep us there."
2016-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Myriam & Alex,"RIchard's house is a pure gem! There is no word to describe how amazing and amazingly located it is! Sleep with the sound of the waves, wake up to an amazing sunrise, go down a few steps and go for a swim, sit down at the front of the house and take in the beautiful scenery... The house itslef is very cute and cosy, the kitchen is very well equiped and the tree house is charming. Mackerel Beach is a wonderful place, and the best is it's only 1 hour from Sydney! Oh I wish I could be there every weekend! Richard is easy to communicate with and arranging, and everything was perfect :)"
2017-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,8356824,Kate,Amazing location close to the beach and restaurants at Bondi. Apartment is cosy and comfortable.

The apartment is just as amazing as the photos indicate! We enjoyed the beautiful scenes of the city lighting up at night time via the roof top garden area! Yang was always available via phone when we needed to communicate and responded quickly. Thoroughly impressed with the apartment and location which we recommend to anyone looking for convince to the city but still far enough away from all the noise. "

They had a lovely garden and a beautiful outdoor setting for us to enjoy. Susan and Greg were very welcoming and gave us plenty of advice on the local area. We hope to come back soon because staying here made the trip so much more special.
2013-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,884057,Joe,"This is a high quality, furnished apartment about 5-10 minutes walk from some lovely beaches which are often deserted. The top-floor apartment itself is well kitted-out and clean and very quiet. Maree and her husband, who live downstairs, are very welcoming and kind. There is a bus very close to the apartment which takes just under an hour to get into the centre. There is a convenience store down the road.

On the downside, the kitchen is quite small and any cooking is based around plug-in hobs and woks which means that cooking for two was a bit of a challenge, but not impossible by any means. The pool is a reasonable size (not for lengths but for dipping in) but unfortunately was unusable for much of our stay. This was a bit of a disappointment, but the sea is not far away!

All in all, this was a nice stay with lovely hosts and I would recommend it to others."

We spent a wonderful 10 days at Susan and Greg's place, they're friendly hosts who are available when you need them. Everything has been thought of at this lovely studio, all amenities are there. Just a short stroll from Bronte Beach and the local shopping strip with a couple of great restaurants. A special mention here for Moxhe, try it out if you can. Public transport to Bondi Junction and the city can be found just around the corner.
All in all this place is worth the money and we should like to come back in the future."

2017-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,16070079,Yohan,"Been visiting Sydney for a week's conference in Sydney. Found Gregoire place in strategic CBD location (one step away from Hyde Park and Museum Station) The size of apartment is humongous eventhough the building is kinda old but the Gregoire's unit is modern. The door in shoes room is kinda stuck and cannot be closed. If you are visiting Sydney for leisure or business trip, staying at Gregoire is recommended. "

2017-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Vicki,The apartment is great and ideal for a couple.  We spent three nights there and it was ideal because of it's location - huge vibe in King Street - and proximity to public transport. Would definetly stay again.  Thank you Narelle.

Thank you"

2016-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,5469086,Melissa,"We didn't get to meet Anitta but she answered all our questions before we arrived. The apartment had two comfortable beds and was very quiet at night. We loved the neighbourhood and found it to be delightful. It was easy to take a bus from the airport and into the city. We had a great stay.

2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,16166535,Nathan,"Fei’s Place is a beautiful Victorian stately home in an excellent location, with a modern, well appointed kitchen and Fei is the perfect host."
2017-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Paul,"I had a great time staying at Paul & Judith’s place!  They are very nice and fun to be with. The house and the room  are both clean and filled with character, meaning very comfortable. It’s also close to quite a few restaurants and bus lines. You can make a turn or two and walk for 30 minutes or so and be at the Opera House!  I recommend it highly."
2018-06-08T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Lucas,"Wonderful space. Self-contained, completely private, simple & stylish, very clean and only a 5 minute walk to the bus which will get you into the heart of the city in 20 minutes. I will definitely try to book here again next time I visit Sydney."
2017-04-30T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Marija,"Good communication, lovely view and clean homey apartment !"
2014-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Joanne,"We checked in for 2 nights stay at Belinda's Cabin and had the most relaxing time. The beaches are within close walking distance and the RSL Club is just a few hundred metres away. The Cabin was extremely clean and comfortable, adequately equipped kitchen and well stocked with books, dvd’s and multimedia equipment for a good quiet weekend and high degree of privacy. A true hidden gem indeed and would definitely recommend for those looking for a quiet and relaxing getaway."
2014-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Judith,"Super helpful, super nice! Have had an exceptionally great time at her place! Thanks for everything."
2018-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,22124796,Wendy,"Although I did not meet Tam, she is an excellent and proactive communicator.  Because of this, our self-sufficient check in went smoothly and we felt supported, although she was remote.  The space is clean, ideal for it's balcony and proximity to Barangaroo, CBC, The Rocks & Circular Quay.  Our stay was comfortable and enjoyable.  Many thanks, Tam!"
2018-10-23T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Craig,Great place with easy access to transport and the city. Quiet neighborhood. Wendy is spot on with prompt communcation. TV remote wasnt working proper but I am sure Wendy will sort it out
2018-01-24T05:00:00.000Z,21127680,Shuang,the location of the apartment is really convenient! Next to the central station. really nice to stay 8 days here! !
2018-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,21939239,A J,"If you are wanting to experience living in arguably Sydney’s best neighborhood, look no further than one of Don’s perfectly appointed apartments in Surrey Hills.  Located in a terrace house playfully and surprisingly accurately named after Barbary Lane, the multistory (and multi-storied) complex in Armistead Maupin’s Tales Of The City, you can easily blend into the vibrant local scene.  Shops, restaurants, and nightlife are all within the surrounding blocks; while the major attractions like the opera house and Harbour Bridge are either a short ride or slightly longer walk away.  Both apartments feature outdoor space; well-equipped kitchens and bathrooms; washer/dryer; air conditioning; and designated living, dining & sleeping areas.  Everything was spotless; the mattress was comfortable; and the towels were soft and fluffy. 

Don was the perfect host — excellent communication, there whenever you needed him and yet invisible if want/need privacy.  He even offered to take me and my rather cumbersome bike box to the airport.  On a national holiday, no less!  I would happily stay here again during future trips to Sydney."
2018-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,23222456,Alan,What you see is basically what you get.  It is comfortable historic but not luxurious (heritage listing prevents that).  Donna was very hospitable and I had a welcoming cup of tea soon after arrival.  I would happily stay with her again.
2019-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,24608152,Christian & Kirsty,"Third time we’ve stayed, and enjoyed it again. The kids loved the pool. Check in and check out and communication very easy. Would definitely stay again."
2016-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,11719579,Michelle,Kate's place was great! I'd definitely stay again.  It was very clean and her roommates are wonderful--very chill and easy to live with.Kate was very considerate of any concerns I had as well and do all she could to ensure I was comfortable.
2018-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,13595339,Sarah,"Mariana's place is a charming Art Deco studio apartment with a lovely mix of restored original features alongside modern, quality comforts. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom and kitchen both clean and well equipped.  The apartment is situated in a fantastic location; surrounded by shops, cafes and walks with Kings Cross Station a short walk away. I would highly recommended Mariana's apartment, and would definitely stay again."
2018-03-29T04:00:00.000Z,15923846,James,"Great location, very central. Suzanna was fantastic at giving us some great local knowledge and was very helpful."
2015-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Simon,"Three reasons why you should definitely stay here:
- Perfect location: in a quiet street and yet close to both the city centre and gastronomic paradise Surry Hills. Very well served by public transport too.
- The house itself is smartly renovated, the room and your bed comfortable, and you have your own bathroom and even a terrace!
- You stay with a very attentive host. He seems to be online all the time, replying instantly, which is really practical for bookings or any further questions. And he has just thought of everything, including a charming welcoming package and a booklet with the best local spots to have breakfast, lunch, dinner, a drink...

This has been my first experience with airbnb, and a real good one!"
2017-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,21244482,Francois,"Joseph is a great host.
I had a wonderful stay - 10/10.
Great spot, superb location, super friendly courteous landlord.
I was here in Sydney on work and it honestly felt like an amazing holiday.
Will be back soon"
2018-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Estefanie,"We loved Wendy’s place! Is so comfy and clean, close to everything! 100% you should stay here. Everything what we needed was there. Thank you Wendy for your hospitality, we will definitely come back!"
2018-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,13320545,Annie,Great stay in the perfect location!
2018-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,24916551,Sravani,Alice and Richard are very sweet hosts. They were in touch with me from the moment I booked the AirBNB to when we checked out of their place. They welcomed us with a little gift basket of food and kept a little note to make us feel at home. Their hospitality was excellent! I’d highly recommend their Home to anyone!
2018-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Jeffrey,"Great location, excellent kitchen. Bathroom could be improved but otherwise well worthwhile and fair value. Millie is a very good host."
2016-08-16T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Kate,"Cath was very warm and welcoming, as were her 3 chickens! The accomodation had everything we could possibly need, even opal cards to use. Fresh bread was waiting at the door on Sunday morning which went down a treat. The studio was snug and warm and I'd like to build one myself, it was very cool! 
5 stars :)"
2018-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Lidio,Great location and fair price.
2017-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,16651655,Maria,"Very convenient location within easy walking distance to the train station and handy to the city.  

Tidy and functional accommodation, good value for money.

Steven was friendly and easygoing and communication was good.

Thanks for having me to stay."
2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,1944996,Craig,"A lovely little place in a great location. We could walk or catch the bus into the city centre very quickly, and buses run to the main beaches from basically outside the door. 

Special thanks for the local tips!"
2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Hanan,Had a great stay!
2016-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Sora,Sam's place is close to public transport and Sam was very quick to reply to any questions. The place was clean and cosy.
2018-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Ming Wai,"The house is clean enough and has enough space.  The kitchenware and dishes are dirty and need to be cleaned for a long time. The washing machines always suck with the dust, washing powder... 
The parking area is extremely hard to find and have to use around 10 mins to find the area in the car park. However, the view is perfect which can see the river without blocking. "
2017-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Richard,"This is a lovely apartment, in a hotel/serviced apartment building.  For once the pictures really don't do it justice.  The hotel rooms get marked down for being dated in reviews on hotel sites, but this apartment certainly isn't.  It's centrally located: it has Darlinghurst's little strip of restaurants just around the corner, and central Sydney equally close in the other direction.  I was here for a week in March and it (unusually) rained every day, so the 60"" UHD Samsung smart TV with Netflix and Stan (Aussie streaming), as well as Apple TV, was particularly welcome, as was the small gym on the roof.  The pool was less useful, but would be great normally.  Desireé is a very friendly host too.  Highly recommended."
2019-01-24T05:00:00.000Z,27009904,Natesha,This my second time staying at Tim and Mel’s and it was just as awesome as the first time! I had an evening flight and Tim arranged for me to keep my luggage in the apartment until I went to the airport.
2018-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,22661818,Melanie,Perfectly positioned apartment at the quiet end of Manly beach but still close to everything. We loved spending time on the generous balcony taking in the beautiful view. The two car spaces were super-convenient and the friendly host was easy to deal with. Loved the decor too!
2019-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,20906942,Jordan,Would book again!
2016-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,10213499,Samantha,"Great Studio, perfect location, had everything we needed. Tracy was lovely, really welcoming. The directions were great, it was easy to find. Would certainly look to book if we ever needed to stay in the area again.  "
2018-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Joanna,"Fantastic location - a beautiful walk along the water to the Opera House and Bridge, countless cafes and restaurants at your doorstep, and a superb Saturday market just across the road, plus only a short walk to the train station to go further afield. We loved the apartment itself too and will definitely return one day!"
2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Louisa,"Millie was a lovely host, super friendly and great at communicating in the lead up to our stay. The studio is really cute, compact and well designed with some nice touches - coffee machine, emergency toiletries. A great stay, thanks! "

2015-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Rebecca,"We made a last minute booking and although Mal was out of town,  he responded quickly and gave clear direction on how to access the apartment. He was also flexible on check in and out times. The view is amazing, exactly as portrayed in the pictures. We didn't spend much time in the apartment but it is clean and has everything you need to enjoy your stay.  So much to do and great places within walking distance to eat and drink. Only warning would be for those with physical challenges- apartment is on the 3rd floor with no lift. "
2018-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Bee Kee,"Great host, fast respond. Place very near Redfern station. House very tidy and comfort."
2015-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Lucy,Beautiful home and Rachel was an excellent host.
2019-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Judith,"Our family group stayed at Heidi's back in 2016 and we all loved it. One of the kids, aged 8, who has travelled the world and stayed in many fabulous places, declared ""Oh, I LOVE that house"" when he heard we were returning this year. And once again it lived up to his expectations and surpassed ours. The five bedrooms are stunning and the mattresses to die for on the comfort front. The three bathrooms are the epitome of luxury - they have all been completely made over since our last visit and are both beautiful and functional. The pool, the spa, the cubby house, the hammocks, the undercover outdoor area ... the list of features goes on. And to complete the package is Heidi - the most responsive, flexible host you could hope to meet. If you are looking for a space to share and create memories this is it. Book it now. You won't regret it."

2016-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Mardi,"Highly recommended! Great hosts, wonderful light filled property with every little detail considered. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to the next visit. "
2018-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Jade,"Excellent location to cafes, beaches and parks. Very quiet. Only thing when hot or air needed not many of the windows open, there are fans in bedrooms which help. Thanks for the stay."
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,26829659,Hannah,Great apartment to stay in when attending events at Olympic Park. Plenty of places to eat in the area and quick responses from the host when needed.
2017-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Fiona Saputra,"This lovely and warm house is excellent ... beachfront, warm home feel, bright, clean, public bus stop is just a minute away. 

The beach is a beautiful one with an ocean pool. So not only dip into it and kids may find it interesting as well.

Kitchen is fully equipped with everything a family may need. 

The host is a kind couple. We were welcome warmly and of course, hope that you are lucky enough like us with a banana cake treat !"
2018-07-05T04:00:00.000Z,24993202,Matthew,Amazing place in a great location. Highly recommend

2013-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Adele,"Bundeena is beautiful. The perfect spot for an easy weekend away from the constant noise of the city. And Belinda and Chris' Garden cottage is a fantastic place to spend time. Stones throw from the beach and beautiful coastal walks, but completely private in a little garden oasis. Birds everywhere. The cottage is fitted out beautifully, with thoughtfulness and great taste. We would love to return. And next time we're hoping for better luck spotting whales!"
2016-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Melina,"This place was charming, well kept and spacious with the most scenic views. Wayne and Kate were very accommodating and had thought about all the finer details to ensure we had a lovely visit. 
Would definitely recommend to others. "
2018-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,22341528,Sarah,Good location. Good if you just want someone to sleep.
2018-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Monica,"Great location, tidy and clean modern apartment, very easy access to Darling Harbour area and the inner city. Treat yourselves to lunch at Machiavelli in Clarence street, a three minute walk. Having two separate bathrooms was bonus and view of the harbour from the bedrooms and the living room was lovely. Oriel was excellent with his communication and his check in instructions and the three of us really enjoyed our stay. Thank you!"
2014-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Wayne & Kate,"Stunning! Relaxing, charming, private, secluded and stunning again. A sanctuary. We loved being there and so will you. Although don't go! We'd hate to think it will get booked out. We want to go back! Thanks for having us, Richard. You were a helpful and kind host and we hope to deal with you again. You have a wonderful place!"
2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,20578419,Jixiang,"很好的居住体验,我很喜欢地理位置"
2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Adelia,"Alexey’s place is very nice & clean. I love his two storey place which is close to everywhere. Close to many different kinds of restaurants. I love it coz it’s walkable to China town where you can buy cheap different kinds of souvenirs from Australia. Alexey was very helpful & upfront in answering our queries. Very good host who was very easy to reach out when we have questions. 

Definitely recommendable 100% & definitely will stay again when we decided to go back to Sydney."
2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Chris,"Very nice, spacious place close to the beach!  Also very convenient to the bus which we used to travel to the SCG. "
2018-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Steve,"A beautiful apartment in a magical setting
If you are thinking of visiting Sydney then Bronte is to be highly recommended as a place to base yourselves and the only place to stay in Bronte is in Susan and Gregg’s stylish and comfortable apartment. 
The room is thoughtfully decorated in a simple modern style and has a great shower room included. It sits within their lovely shady garden and is a hidden gem. 
Great hosts supplying knowledgeable tips for trips and eating - don’t miss Three Blue Ducks or UYen Vietnamese restaurant; Char Rotisserie and Iggy’s Bakery in Bronte nearby. 
Bronte is on the Bondi to Coogee cliff walk and is one of the most beautiful bays - only a short walk from the apartment - though a steep climb back!
A hire car is useful though buses trains and especially the Rose Bay Ferry are easily found. Opal cards give hassle free access to these public transport options to the City - but take the ferry for the best views and experience. 
Your hosts will deliver fresh bedding and often bagels as well as jam and honey for breakfast - though gong out for breakfast and brunch is clearly a Sydney institution given the quality and choice available - Shuk or Lox Stock and Barrel both in North Bondi and Three Blue Ducks in Bronte."
2016-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Kirrily And Tom,What an incredible sanctuary! We had the best time staying at Angela's beautiful home. Every detail had been thought of to make our stay enjoyable. Angela was a fantastic host and the home was very relaxing in its beautiful surrounds and lovely furnishings.
2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,John,"Anita is a lovely person.  She was very accommodating with check in and check out.  It's quite a challenge with long overseas flights that do not necessarily land or depart at convenient times.  Anita was quick to respond, very helpful in showing me around the neighborhood. The place is sparkling clean and has a brilliant view of the beach. Very comfortable and spacious study in an iconic location.  And a thoughtful host who will help you with anything you need!"
2018-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,22068048,Sharon,"Extremely clean apartment inside& out. The hosts Lucy &Ralph are very welcoming.
Beautifully decorated.  A lot of thought has been put into the finer details. There is wifi& (Website hidden by Airbnb) abundance of extra Manchester. Aircon. Anything you need is definitely there. A lovely kitchen with excellent cooking facilities."
2016-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,8408379,Peter,The host canceled this reservation 87 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2018-07-19T04:00:00.000Z,23493822,Erin,"This is a very small, private space perfect for one or two people in a secluded, residential area. It is a bit far from public transport as the bus stop is a bit of an uphill walk, but very much doable nonetheless! Xiaowen is great at communication and is fast with responses to any messages or inquiries. I loved that I had my own entrance and bathroom as well as a lot of closet space and great, modern aesthetics. My only things to specify are that guests should bring their own bath towels, and when I first booked this space it was listed as a private unit but it is actually on the side of the house and connected to the main house within the room by a locked door — I could easily hear noise from the kitchen during the morning and day, and the family also occasionally will play a piano that is located very close to the door. Other than that everything was very clean and check-in/out was very easy and convenient!"
2018-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Trey,Great location! Enjoyed our visit.
2017-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,18935312,Lafras,The host canceled this reservation 39 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2015-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Tina,"We found the hosts, Wayne & Kate very accommodating.  They were always very quick to respond to our queries and the unit was as described.  Very good position, spacious and comfortable.  The extra touch of a bottle of champagne was a very thoughtful gesture.  Street parking was not a problem.  There is a cafe directly opposite on Tamarama Beach or a short walk through the park to a strip of cafes at Bronte Beach.  Also a nice 15 min walk around the coast to Bondi.  "
2018-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Robert,Great place to stay in Sydney at Kings Cross
2019-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,4872526,Andrew,"House is in a stunning location nestled in the hills of Bilgola. 

Really enjoyed the privacy ,light filled rooms and stunning views. 

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Sydney while still being in a central location to access some of Sydney's best beaches."
2014-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Daniel,"If you're looking for your own little place while away, this is the place for you. The Garden Studio had all the little things you'd need on a weekend away: a lounge area, a nice little kitchen and bench, a great bathroom and a very comfortable loft.

Being out the back of the house, separated by the courtyard, and accessible through path along the side of the house (bordered by a chicken coup) it  is in a very private location.

Cath was great too! She was there to greet us and left us a hamper to snack on. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
"
2013-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Jason,"Everything went smoothly and Wayne and Kate were very easy to deal with. The apartment is stunning, wonderful views of the beach, and although I only spent the afternoon there, my Mum and her friends who stayed over found everything they needed and were raving about the location. I'll be back! :)"
2018-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Katelin,Very cosy apartment! Perfect for one or two people for trips! Victoria was a great host and made it super easy to get in contact with!

2016-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Amin,"I booked the room from my account for one of my friends and this is his view: 
Actually, I was lucky that I spent my first days in Sydney in Natasa' lovely house. I spent more than two weeks there. As other people here mentioned, you feel that you are in your own house and have freedom for yourself. Alot of movies are provided in living room that you can select among them and watch. Also you can enjoy the lovely kitchen and the terrace. Being completely close to trian station, it is perfect for new arrivals like me. Also, the area is completely close to city center. When Natasa is at home you can enjoy talking with her. Unfortunately, we could not see each other so much since most of that time she was on a business trip. However among afew talks that we had, I enjoyed her manner and kindness. Beside your room, there are two other bedrooms in the first floor that you should share bathroom with them. It was ok and we had no problem. Also because the weather at most time was mild, the lack of airconditioning did not cause a problem. 
Finally, thanks again Natasa"

2016-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Daphane,"Millie was a fantastic host! 

The studio located in the perfect spot - super close to the CBD, but not too close from the hustle and bustle as well. It's only a short 5-10 walk from the train station to the apartment, and the streets are well lit at night so it's safe. Studio itself was clean, neat and comfortable.

Will be staying here again if I find myself in Sydney again!"

2019-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,21999107,Joan,"Neil’s place in Watson’s Bay, is the perfect location for a get away in Sydney. He is easy to communicate with and very accommodating, providing beautiful fresh produce for our stay. 

The house is beautifully furnished, it feels like you are in your own little tropical oasis and then as soon as you step out the front door you are a minute away from the lovely camp cove beach and a couple of minutes walk to Watson’s Bay hotel and the famous Doyle’s restaurant. There are also so many lovely walking tracks along the foreshore that provide you with spectacular views of the city. 

My husband and I had a fabulous time and would highly recommend Neil’s place!"
2015-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,New,The place was great; clean and quiet with modern and tasteful appointments. Large living/dining space. The location fantastic. Nicole was only a call away and always happy to offer advice when needed. Would definitely be back.

2018-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Brenda,Really awesome location in the city and super convenient to get everywhere from (it’s minutes walk from Kings Cross Station). There was some noise from construction but as we were out all day it didn’t bother us. Would definitely recommend!
2018-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Amanda,"Great spot, amazing location. Craig and Leonie are very nice and very accommodating, make great recommendations."
2017-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Heidi,"Apartment is conveniently located within a short walk from Circular Quay. Baggage storage company just down 2 blocks away. Open from 8am - 5pm at a cost of $13. This was handy as we arrived early in the morning and wanted to go to the zoo for the day before checking in the late afternoon. Communication with our host was prompt and they were flexible with check in time. 
The apartment was exactly what I expected.  Very spacious for central Sydney. Opening window to let in fresh breeze. The most comfortable bed I have ever slept in . Better than most hotels."
2019-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Lachlan,"Absolutely amazing space; close to transport and other services, very clean and comforting. Would stay again and again and again!"

2017-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Jodi,"This is my second stay at Mews in Newtown now, first in 14 & this time 7. Both stays have been amazing. Apartment is beautiful, central, walkable to anythign you need and the host wonderful. I stayed for business, and will try and book this apartment as often as I can. Everything I need so conveniently located. Thanks Narelle for having me again!"
2016-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Jeffery,This is a lovely 2 bedroom apartment on the 11th floor overlooking Sydney's Olympic Park. Plenty of room and nice amenities.
2015-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Stephanie & Duane,"Richard's Mackeral Beach property is a gem! A perfect escape from the city for a weekend. Good for groups, with a well appointed kitchen. Richard was an excellent host keeping in touch regularly and taking great care to ensure we had a great relaxing time at Mackeral."
2018-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,16020247,Libby,"This property makes no excuses for the fact that it is someone's home in original condition, not a private property dressed up as an alternative to a hotel. Be sure your expectations are clear.

Would not recommend as a three/four bed arrangement but perfectly comfortable as a two bed deal.

Kassandra' communication was timely and clear. The location is good, particularly for vintage clothes and variety of food, and the street is quiet. The back yard is a sanctuary."
2014-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Muroa,"Had a wonderful time staying with Hernan and would definitely recommend it to anyone! He's a super friendly, fun  and welcoming guy, going out of his way to help me find the nearest bus and train stations. 

The apartment was spacious and comfortable, and seriously the perfect location! So close to the beach, airport and city. If you're visiting Sydney I would absolutely recommend staying here!"
2015-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Madeleine,"Erika and I had a lovely time staying with Susan (and Angelo the cat) in Sydney. The room itself is quite spacious and very private, being tucked away in the backyard. Susan was generous enough to provide us with a selection of delicious free breakfast options, which was much appreciated, especially by those travelling on a tight budget! There is plenty of free parking in the street and public transport close by. We would definitely stay here again! "
2018-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,21568012,John,"David's place was fine.  It was easy to get to from the airport by bus, which stops right outside the cafe shown in the pictures.  As expected, the place has all the basic amenities one needs, and there are lots of restaurants in the area as well as a supermarket."
2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,29466814,Kylie,Absolutely amazing. It was my first time using Airbnb and Cathy made it a wonderful experience. The place was so fresh and tidy. Will definitely stay there again.

The location is really close to CBD and any public transportation. Highly recommend to friends who travel to Sydney with a group of people."
2016-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,David,I really enjoyed my stay at Hugo’s apartment. His friend Oliver was incredibly helpful and held our luggage till the apartment was available as well as holding it until we flew out after check-out. The apartment is perfectly located and walking distance to most areas as well as public transport. It is an easy walk to the CBD as well as Oxford St and many restaurants. The fridge was broken however that was not really an issue for us. Would definitely stay at Hugo’s again.
2015-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Stuart,"From our initial communication to the day we checked out, we could not fault our stay here.  Nicole was super-efficient with communication, the apartment was perfect for our two week stay and we can't recommend this place highly enough.
The location is perfect, just a five minute walk to the ""Central"" rail station which is a twelve minute ride from the airport.
Surry Hills is a vibrant neighborhood, with a range of restaurants from coffee and cake to fine dining and everything in between.
Bondi beach is a fifteen minute drive and Circular Quay (for the Opera House and Bridge) just four stops on the train."
2017-03-10T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Tanja,"Great location and really clean apartment. Paul was a lovely host, met us at check in and was available on the mobile if we ever needed anything. Would recommend it! "

2017-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Andrew,House is in a great location and Jeremy very easy to deal with and most helpful. Property could do with a bit of an update although very clean but decor looking tired.

2016-04-04T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Varun,"Paul's place is furnished beautifully, clean and looks exactly like in the pictures. And although, we couldn't meet Paul in person, he was a pleasure to interact with over the phone. He was accommodative of our late check out and had a well curated brochure explaining the basics and more of the house and a bit of Sydney.
Located quite ideally to look around Sydney, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely come again."
2018-08-03T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Allison,"Susan's cottage is so sweet, compact but with everything you need and nothing you don't need. She is so kind and friendly. We loved staying at her cottage and will miss the birds singing every morning. If you want to be near Bronte Beach, it's just wonderful. "
2018-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,24460964,Abigail,Great place! Great location!
2018-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Damian,"What a fantastic place! Excellent communication and check-in arrangements. Sparkling clean, beautiful and large space, fantastic location, warm and we'll equipped. A++++++"
2017-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Joy,"A great place to stay the night. We were on our way from Victoria to Queensland, and Sarah's room was just right for our family. Lots of sleeping options and a great pool for the kids to splash in."
2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,23650892,Nat,"Naveen’s place was amazing and we truly enjoyed her place! We were rarely in the apartment as we were out sightseeing, but definitely a great spot to relax and enjoy the views! Will return again soon!"
2019-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Remi,"We had a beautiful time at Angela’s apartment. Everything was exactly as described and Angela went out of her way to provide thoughtful touches including ammenities for the beach and gorgeous fresh fruit, bread and other snacks. The apartment is in a great spot and very easy to get in to Avalon town with many great restaurants and things to do. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"
2018-06-27T04:00:00.000Z,12098138,Mary,We loved staying at Lizzy’s place!  The location was fantastic!  The view from the apartment was spectacular!  Super cool Home and we especially loved the boat “couch” in the living room!
2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Ulli,"Great location with choices for everything you might need (cafes, restaurants, supermarket, transport (bus, rail to CBD), within easy reach.  For walkers, wending your way down to Woolloomooloo, Mrs Macquarie's Chair & Botanical Gardens is a treat.  Vickie's city pad is a comfortable, tidy, pleasant retreat with a lovely view.  The immediate surroundings are excellent, as is the building in which the apartment is situated."
2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,15889399,Rachel,"Nice little place, very comfy bed and good shower.  Good job there's air con as it would be very hot without it! Short walk to Petersham station, the Oxford tavern, Nowa cafe which is excellent.  My only complaint would be the triangular window lets in quite a lot of light in the morning and it woke me up! Other than that it's a nice little place."
2015-07-01T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Patrick,"Perfect location which close to the train station with nice cafe and bar nearby.

Both Neveen and Tristan are very friendly and willing to give useful advise for us when to travel around.

We would love to stay here again whenever we are in Sydney and highly recommend it to all of you."

It’s close to everything, we walked to both Bondi beach and Bondi junction. 
Iv stayed in many air Bnbs in Sydney and this will be the only one we will book from now on.
Can’t wait to return!! Thanks Jenny :)"

2018-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,21612973,Natalie,"Lovely clean apartment a few mins walk from beach. However the owners are there all the time, sleeping in room next door. If you want a private getaway, perhaps not the best place as there is no opportunity for privacy at all. Bring your eye mask unless you like waking up with birds as the room is full of light with no curtains."
2015-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Mark,"Susan was extremely hospitable welcoming Katie and myself to her beautiful B&B studio. We enjoyed  breakfast in the sunny private garden and the recommended cafes and restaurants in Bronte and close by Coogee. Our stay was topped off with the fantastic costal walk through to Bondi beach. 

Would highly recommend.

Thanks a bunch Susan! "
2016-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Lawrie,"Graige & Leonie gave us a friendly reception and accommodated our early arrival. They are excellent hosts and make you feel welcome and relaxed.  The place is in a superb location being only few minutes walk to Bondi Beach which is well serviced with transport to Sydney every 10 minutes. 
We loved having breakfast in their peaceful backyard listening to the bird-life in the mornings. The area is nice and quiet considering its handy locality to everything Bondi offers. Overall an excellent stay with a good sized bedroom and own bathroom. Highly recommend ! Judy & Lawrie (NZ)"
2018-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,5923031,Aaron,The unit is exactly as described and it is excellent. In the heart of Newtown but still really quiet inside and very comfortable. The apartment was very well maintained and we really enjoyed staying there. Thank you.

2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Brendan,"We stayed with Michele for one night in September 2018. The room is within their home, but has its own private entrance and bathroom. The guest area is only separated from the hosts home by a curtain (there are doors on both the bedroom& bathroom!) although it is still very quiet and private. Michele is a great host and has set the space up well with a comfortable bed, nice towels & linen and tea and breakfast cereal provided. The location is great - a very quiet back street but only a few minutes walk to the bars and restaurants of Newtown."

L'appartement lui-même est grand et agréable avec plusieurs balcons... Tout est comme sur les photos. Nous n'avons pas rencontré Linda mais elle a répondu rapidement à toutes nos questions et a fait de son mieux pour rendre notre séjour encore meilleur. 
Sydney est une grande et belle ville et ce lieu est un point de chute idéal pour la visiter."

2016-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,5347035,Juliette,We had the most amazing time at the lovely home of Javier! They made us feel like we were just at home and it was so central we could reach everything in 5 minutes. Eventhough we were a little late you guys were so laid back and easy going that we experienced the surfinglife exactly like it is. Thank you guys so much for everything! It  was such a blast to stay at yours!!!!

2017-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,16651655,Andrea,"Steven was lovely from the start & helped me bring my bags in and offered me some fresh strawberries from his garden which I thought was quite nice! The place was quite spacious and on a hot day it still felt cool inside. There was beautiful art around and the location was central. It was easy for me to find a parking spot as well. Even though it was at the back of Steven's place, I still feel like I had a lot of privacy. It was easy to catch a $20 uber into the city (although the train station is close if that's what you prefer). I'd definitely recommend staying here! "
2016-08-02T04:00:00.000Z,6201263,Carolane,Very well located and Yoco was  answering and available if you needed something.
2017-09-18T04:00:00.000Z,20374683,Cheryl,"Thankyou so much for having us! The place was beautiful and clean! Also, the host was so lovely and friendly :) This apartment was also so close to everything you need. I will definitely be staying here everything I come to Sydney!"
2016-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Kelly,"Amazing appartment with a stunning view. The pictures on the profile are accurate, you cant stay much closer to the beach than this. 
The appartment is well equipped, spacious, clean and his free WIFI.
There is a bus stop just outside the door which makes it really easy to commute to the city and back. 
Though Bondi can be really busy at the weekends the appartment is not in the middle of the ""party section"" which gives you peace and quiet when needed. 
Mal was the perfect host who was always quick to reply via messages or App to any questions we had. It was even possible to have a later check out as we were flying out late. 
We had an amazing stay and couldnt have asked for more !! Highly recommended to anyone !!!"
2015-11-02T05:00:00.000Z,6046461,James,"Absolutely brilliant experience from the second I arrived to the second I left.
The apartment is beautiful and immaculately clean.
Suzie met me upon arrival around 7am and was so helpful in orientation and advice of the area.
The location is ideal- 5 minutes to the centre of the CBD.
This is my favorite Airbnb house and host so far and would absolutely return to stay again on my next trip to Sydney!!
Thank you Suzie!!"
2018-04-17T04:00:00.000Z,20906942,Shania,Amazing apartment and close to everything. 15 min walk to Darling harbour and 20 mins to the local Ferry. Great location.

2016-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Chris,"The perfect experience for our first Airbnb stay!  Friendly and effortless welcome with all of the info we would need to immediately feel right-at-home.  Secure parking right outside our door and beautifully private.  The room and facilities were immaculate and very well appointed, conducive to a very relaxed two weeks which my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed.  Our host was always available for queries and a chat but never obtrusive.

Avalon should be on your to-do list when visiting Sydney with world-class beaches on one hand, beautiful Pittwater on the other and  boutique shopping and all the facilities one could require in between.  Conveniently situated within easy reach of all of these, Cathy's cosy room is an ideal retreat, cool and quiet on a hot afternoon with the sound of birds and the breeze in the tall gum-trees to enjoy as you unwind.

With views of the city overlooking the harbour bridge, it was in close proximity to Kirribilli shops, Milsons Point Station and North Sydney wharf. Would definitely recommend for tourists seeking a base to explore Sydney or locals for a weekend away :)"
2019-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,20206764,Samara,We had a great stay in the house and it’s in a great location. We had a car and found parking on the street easy and the house is just a short 5min walk to the beach. Our 17 month old loved the park by the beach and the playground. The house itself is very modern and the bedrooms are filled with light but they also have good blackout blinds which we appreciated. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a beachside escape in Sydney.
2018-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Vishal,The house is very close to CBD and darling harbour and is very quiet. The house was sparkling clean and duncan and ashlee are very amicable

2019-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,24360345,Alessandro,"The flat is nice and matches the photographs perfectly with everything one might need. The awesome extra is the pool and hot tub which really help you unwind at the end of the day. The hosts, while never met personally, were organised and clearly take their 'job' to heart."
2015-04-20T04:00:00.000Z,888107,Ye Xuen,"Hi! The stay at Wyatt's house was amazing (: I had such a lovely time there with my boyfriend, he's helpful and provide tips and where to go.

Very happy with my stay and highly recommend the cute garden studio.  

Both my mom and I had a great time in Sydney."

2018-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,19641701,ByungSoo,"멋진 장소입니다. 멋진 시드니의 경치를 경험하세요. 아침과 저녁 페리를 타고 다니는 경험 또한 놀라운 경험입니다.
다만 가방이 무거운 사람들은 조금 힘들수가 있어요. 페리에서 내려서 언덕과 계단을 올라가야 하고, 아파트 계단을 올라야 합니다. 짐이 많은 사람들은 체크인과 체크아웃을 할때 우버를 이용하심이 좋겠네요."

There was a problem(it's not Eleni's fault) and she try her best to solve it. She is kind host:) The house is lovely, and there are lots of fancy restaurants around this place. Moreover, the house is bigger than I expect."

The outdoor patio was perfect to sit and relax with a cheese plate and wine. 

Angela and Geoff made us feel very at home, and allowed us the privacy to enjoy the weekend away with our kids. Angela also made the extra effort for our kids to enjoy the break - plenty of toys and books and even offered a cot and highchair.

We will be back!  "

2016-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,风,"Besides the location is very convent not only near the city center but also surrounded by 2 Coles market. This is the most fantastic and lovely experience I ever had.
Paul and his family are very good at taking care of their guests, they prepare milk, honey, orange, cereal for us. During the 2 weeks, they just treat us as same as a part of the family, inviting us to their festival dinner, introducing us to their best friends. Every morning they would ask if it was a good sleep. Every evening, they would say good night before we go back to the room. 
If ever I will go back to Sydney again, this would be my only choice. 

这是我在Airbnb中最最满意的一次住宿体验｡
不仅仅这个地理位置很好,去市中心,悉尼歌剧院,门口的公交车直达｡而且周围的配套设施齐全,十分方便｡
Paul一家人待客非常之好,如若对待家人｡一直给我们买牛奶,橙汁,谷物,蜂蜜等等｡尽可能地提供信息帮助我们｡
只要去悉尼,对于住处,这永远会是我的第一,也是唯一的选择｡

2019-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Penny,A good few days once we arrived although we dealt with Chen and the phone number on the listing does not relate. A bit dated but provided everything described. My husband was getting spiked by the couch in the living area but just had to be careful. It is in walking distance to the Wharfs and the city bus tour bus stop is close by with tickets being purchased on the wharf
2019-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Dong,Extremely good location and very friendly responsive host. Very tidy apartment. Parking space on the street can be hard to find but a Wilson carpark is almost next door.
2018-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,20578419,Sharon,"Location and the appartments foyer was the highlight. The apartment itself was a little older than expected, the city views were not as shown.

There were also neighborhood shops and restaurants within an easy walk.  We appreciated that beach towels and breakfast were provided.  We also appreciated their flexibility about check out when our plans changed.  The studio is just like it looks in the pictures and the garden is a very peaceful place to wake up in.  We recommend to anyone looking for some quiet, peaceful time in a great area."
2017-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,15889399,Sibylle,"The airBNB place was a great find. It was really clean, comfortable, quiet & very convenient for the training location (Addison Street Community Centre). Steve, the host, knew the local area well and recommended a number of shops/cafes in the area."
2016-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,15920870,Febrinna,This was my first airbnb and I can hardly put this property into words. The place was clean and comfortable and the view from the balcony was amazing. Waking up in the morning and hearing the horses clip clopping around Randwick racecourse was special and unique. Oliver was super accomodating and he was a great host. I was only there for a night but will definitely stay again!

The street itself is extremely quiet yet within a short walking distance to shops, restaurants and good public transport.  We also found the place had an ideal weather aspect and always attracted a nice breeze.  Mags was a very efficient host from start to finish.  We were sorry to leave and look forward to a return visit."

2015-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Tobias,Cathy was a very nice and communicative host that helped us with some awesome and important tips and had many things to recommend in the area. Her place was only a 10 min. walk away from Avalon beach and an 15 min. drive to the gorgeous palm beach. The room was beautifully decorated and clean.
2016-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Wiraaj,Our experience staying at Lina's Kingswood property was very positive. The newly-built house is well-appointed and true to the online listing.

"
2018-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,5923031,Francine,"The apartment is very well-located, comfortable, cool and well-equipped. Narelle ensures everything runs smoothly and easily. I stayed five nights, and the apartment is equally well-suited to shorter or longer stays, with everything guests might need. The local neighbourhood is terrific. The apartment is located on a busy road in a bustling area, but the sound-proofing is excellent, so you have the benefit of being in the middle of a lively local scene while the apartment is calm and quiet. Recommended."
2015-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Sarah,"I needed a house for 6 of my operators as we were working nights at the Sydney Airport. We booked with Marcella as the location was perfect, we had a few hiccups with our start date on the run way and Marcella was nothing but a delight to deal with, she accommodated us the best she could and it is very much appreciated. We needed to add additional nights onto our stay and this was not a problem. Marcella is a amazing and from the feedback from my operators (6 men) the house is fantastic.
We as a company and myself as an individual will defiantly book with Marcella at the City Surf Sun & Sand again."

2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,22412815,Jessica,"House was neat. 'Pet Friendly' only means animals are allowed outside, not inside. Made things difficult, and I had known this, I would have booked elsewhere."
2016-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,1944996,Louisa,"The apartment was great, just like the photos. It was lovely to have the balcony too - it gave a sense of space. Furnishings were very comfortable. We cooked most nights and the kitchen had everything we needed but we were very central to many restaurants if we wanted. Highly recommend."
2016-04-30T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Anastasia,"We loved staying for a few days at Rachel's exquisite home.  It is in such a great location, with a excellent providore up the road, and a 3 minute walk to the Military Road to catch a 15 minute bus ride into the CBD.  The house was clean and tidy and spacious for 5 of us. Rachel was very helpful, especially in giving directions and quick in her replies."

2016-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Terry,"I stayed for DJ for 2 and a half weeks.
The pics are accurate, the place is immaculate and clean and quiet, the location is incredible, and DJ was very helpful. I must admit found the layout of the guest bathroom odd...you have to walk down the stairs and kind of go through the lounge to get to it. Some people may be comfortable with that. I wasn't. 
One negative, and it was a big shock with me being from London, was that I came home one day and there were tons of tiny spiders on the wall of my room, that must have come in from the patio. I managed to spray as many as I could, but I must have missed a few as the following few days I kept seeing bigger and bigger spiders in the room. I told DJ about it and he cleaned the dead spiders and spray off the walls, but really what should have happened is that the room should have been fumigated the next day, or I should have recieved some kind of compensation.
I guess spiders are not seen as a big deal in Australia. 
So overall good, except for the spiders."

The apartment was really clean and spacious. I will defiantly stay here again if im ever in need of a place to stay in Mosman."
2019-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Amanda,"Thank you for sharing your home. The privacy was outstanding with check in greating only but available if needed.
We loved your towels and linen, they were a very nice touch.
Your view was priceless and the atmosphere was very relaxing with a touch of luxury."
2016-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Khaled,"I stayed in Millie's place with my wife through our short visit to Sydney, and it was a delight. The place is a walking distance to the restaurants and cafes in Kirribilli, and a one train station away from the city. The station is almost 7-minute walk from the building. Millie did her best to make us feel at home. She provided us with many goodies for breakfast, and made sure we get entertained through her movie and game collection.

I would definitely recommend Millie's place for anyone visiting Sydney, and I would check it out for availability next time I'm planning to visit."

2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,16020247,Carlos,"Great location to live the Newtown lifestyle. Just 5 min away from all type of services, train station is just 10 min away, and just 4 stops to get to downtown Sydney. If more than 4 people, and someone has to sleep in the coach, the cat can be a bit annoying during the night, she will wake you up when hungry ;). We had a great stat though. "
2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,20206764,Raquel,"We loved the place, it has everything.
The walk to the beach was 10 minutes and we didn’t have a problem with that except that it was hard going up the hill for my mother on the way back to the (Website hidden by Airbnb) mother just turned 90 and it would help if we knew about this in advance. We got a car from a relative and we solved the problem.
Thank you Sacha, you were a great host and we enjoyed our stay very much"

2015-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Shereena,"I was in Sydney for 5d4n with my family and stayed at Gavin's apartment. Gavin was very helpful in replying all my messages as when I required his assistance. The check in process was rather easy and straight forward if you follow the steps in his message accordingly. 

The apartment ticked all the basic requirements in terms of comfort and amenities. It was such a hot period whilst we were in Sydney and the strong air conditioning unit and the stand fan in the apartment was a total life saver! However I must give a thumbs up to the location as it was walking distance to the Darling Harbour, QVB, Pitt street mall, Martin place and also just less than 10 minutes walk to Wynyard train station. Gavin allowed us to check in early and also leave our baggages after check out time which was really helpful as we would not need to carry our luggages every where we go.

My family which consist of 4 over 50 year olds has no complain whatsoever on the apartment. It's their words that ""the apartment is good.""

Overall, I must say, I would totally recommend Gavin's apartment. It has ticked all my requirement boxes when it comes to finding a place with good location and comfort :) "

2017-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,13562321,Adam,"The apartment is nice and perfect for city stays. 

My disappointment came when my 70yr old parents we kept awake all night from major reconstruction. Bins are also collected at 130am from outside the apartment. We were not told this was happening.

My mum recleaned on moving in. The dust on top of units and cupboard and under the bed was terrible. Expect a light clean and sheet change on arrival

My parents left 4 nights early and i moved onto my couch. 

No response when feedback was given after stay. 

I would recommend the apartment when Sydney tram works is complete in 2018."

2016-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Jasmine,"Susan was very hospitable even before we arrived at her place.  She was very thoughtful to contact us to provide information needed to get to her place.  Susan also provided suggestions for dinners and cafes to hang out around the Bronte area.  She even provided options for vegetarian!   The studio is exactly what you see in the pictures with a lovely garden.  While we had to walk pass the main house to get to the studio, it was very private at the back of the house and even your own garden.  My only regret was the weather, that it was too cold on the days we were there for us to hang out in the garden to enjoy our wines :)"

2014-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Lena,"I spent five out of ten days in Sydney staying at Hernan's comfortable apartment at Monterey (which is really within Brighton le Sands).

The Apartment :  Comfortable size for two bedrooms, bathroom, living/dining area, kitchen and balcony.   Hernan is very neat and organised, so that added to the comfort level.

The Bedroom :  Has a queen-sized bed, bedside table, small wardrobe, chest of drawers, writing desk.   More than adequate for a single traveller, though room size may be a little compact for two pax ... but there's always the living room and balcony area to chill in.

Transportation :  Not a problem because I had a car.   Public transport within walking distance.   Even if it is not smack in the city area, I have always encouraged travellers to experience the beautiful suburbs of Sydney.  Time permitting, travelling by bus (as opposed to trains) will allow you to see a lot more.

Surrounds :   Nice restaurants/eateries and a couple of large supermarkets are all within easy walking distance.   I managed to stock up on some groceries and had a few meals at ""home"".   The lovely beach is just a few minutes' walk away.   I would encourage guests who drive to explore other beaches and nooks to get a good feel of the district.

Thank you, Hernan, for your warm hospitality and being such a gracious and kind host.   I definitely recommend a stay at this apartment.   "
2017-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Nichola,"Great place for a group - six of us fit very comfortably. Very well appointed apartment close to the center of the city. Communication was quick, friendly and very helpful."
2017-06-30T04:00:00.000Z,12370710,Anne,"Maria and Jerome are such lovely hosts. They really know how to give you your privacy for your holiday (which I very much appreciate), but they are always there when you need them via text/call/Airbnb message, which is greatly assuring. They have awesome recommendations on local places (including places with local deals) and the room does not let your expectations down. The view is absolutely amazing, no matter the weather. The room and amenities are very clean, with extra towels and sheets in the cupboard, should you need them. I was worried about heating since it's winter and the listing didn't have heating ticked, but they provided a thermostat heater that kept us nice and cosy. Another cute thing to note was the deco. There's an adorable kiwi bird toy and some binoculars that we took advantage of with the great view from the window. Also, go up to the terrace! You definitely won't be disappointed at Maria's :)"

Also a short 5-7 min drive to the Sydney Olympic wharf where you can enjoy a 1 hour ferry ride into Circular Quay.  Very comfortable bed and private bathroom for our use.

We were happy to be left to ourselves as Kath was out at work from early morning but we're a bit disappointed that breakfast items weren't replenished over the three days we were there and there were no 'ordinary' tea bags or cereal after first night.
However, we wouldn't, necessarily, let this put us off as the accommodation, itself is good."
2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,22323221,Kateřina,"Agata's place was very nice and cozy. It had its own private entrance and we were able to use a parking spot in the driveway. We visited Sydney in the winter, so the temperatures were a bit cool, but there was a little electric heater that was sufficient to keep us warm. We also appreciated the nice roomy bath tub which can be very convenient after a cool day outside. The kitchen provided everything we needed. Agata even left a tube of Vegemite in the kitchen cabinet, so guests can try this Australian speciality even if they are afraid to buy the whole thing for themselves. We would definitely recommend this place!"
2018-03-07T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Robert,"Anita was a great host and her place was very stylish and located right next to the beach and the bus stop with a beautiful view of Bondi Beach, and also with plenty of space - perfect for a couple. Anita was extremely thoughtful and even put some food in the fridge for us as we were arriving too late to make it out to eat or shopping. Thanks again!!"
2018-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,18082902,Daniel,"This is a fantastic place to stay, close to public transport, great walks close by, peaceful and very thoughtful touches made by the hosts. Would highly recommend this place to a solo traveller."
2016-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Sonia,"Gavin's apartment in Kent St is located in a great central location of Sydney, is clean and fitted the 5 of us. It has a kitchen fir those that want to cook and a balcony too. Check in was easy and we had no issues during our stay. I would definitely recommend it to others and would be happy to stay again. Booking and contact with Gavin was easy too."

2015-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Meghan,"We had a great stay at David's place! The location is perfect...on a quiet street but only a block or so from tons of cafes, bars, shops, and restaurants. David also had some great food recommendations. Everything in the house was new and kept very clean & tidy. The terrace off of the bedroom is very nice. I definitely recommend staying here."
2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,23222456,Lisa,"Charming place with a charming host. We enjoyed meeting Donna and some of her family, and staying in her delightful chique cottage."
2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,21851474,Mallory,Absolutely loved this space. It’s in the perfect area and just a walk away from Surry Hills. Kristin was a great host!

2018-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Eva,"My stay was in one word: Perfect. 
Booking and communications were nice, quick and easy. 
The room was super clean and comfortable and I had my own bathroom. 
Angela is a very nice and helpful person. Meeting her was a good start in Australia. (And lets me forget the „Taxi driver“ who ripped me off ;) )
Going to the center is easy and quick,  just a few bus stops to the next train station."
2014-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Yannik,"Naveen and Tris are great hosts! We felt welcome right from the minute we entered the door! 
The room is clean, modern and has a great view! 
We went out for dinner together in Kings Cross and enjoyed the nice atmosphere a lot! 
All in all once can say that this is a perfect place to stay, even the location of the flat is excellent!"
2018-05-16T04:00:00.000Z,22412815,Prateek,Leena has a huge house and backyard too . But there is no hot water 24X7 . It comes at very odd hours . The bathrooms don’t have locks so it is a little problem if you are staying with your family . We had a good time but he house needs to be modernised .

2019-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,16885508,Janet,We love staying at Ruth's house. The setting is beautiful in a very quiet street with bush behind. A breeze comes up the valley and kookaburras visit. The deck is perfect for relaxing on with the pool and hot tub and there are maket umbrellas for shade. The air conditioning is great and the kitchen has everything. With two bathrooms the house works well for two couples. Drive to St Ives Shopping Village for supplies or to the station for the train to the city.
2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,24863216,James,Lovely spot & easy to get to the city by Bus and Train if you need.
2017-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,16898275,Jennifer,"Trents apartment is in a beautiful street, short walk to the ferry terminal where we were able to take a quick 10 minute trip to Circular Quay to spend our day.

2019-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Jane,"Beautiful beachside location. Really comfortable apartment. Very clean. 
Some lovely touches with a bottle of wine, orange juice, biscuits and basics in the cupboard. 
The apartment keeps cool without the need for air conditioning. 
Direct, punctual bus service into the city and links to elsewhere. 
Highly recommended."

It was quiet, the bed and linens soft, and included amenities that were very helpful (washer/dryer with detergent, all toiletries, good wifi, a bit of cable TV, good selection of kitchen tools, etc.). We walked everywhere, including the Central Business District, Paddington, Bronte, and a ton of other places. Simon and Nicole were very responsive and made our stay there a breeze!"

2016-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,5581269,Gen,We enjoyed our stay and Michy's place lived up to expectations it is a beautiful garden studio in a very beautiful part of the world. Nice place to slow down and get away from it all. Michy was fantastic with communications and making sure we had everything we needed to make our stay successful. Highly recommend
2015-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Dan,"Had a lovely stay with Naveen et all. The perfect spot for access to the City, the cross and New Town. Easy to find, easy to access via the concierge service and exactly as described

Great bars and restaurants nearby and fantastic recommendations from Naveen! Both Naveen and Tristan were very welcoming and helpful from start to finish"

2018-05-14T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Paul,"This is simply the best airb&b in the locale. It has fantastic walks, restaurants, swimming and golf all nearby. The beach is right out front. Bernadette and Fred have prepared a  
very comprehensive guest book which answers nearly all questions you might have. The apartment has everything  most people would need, but we really appreciated the little extras, like Netflix- so we could keep up with our favourite shows while the rain teemed down outside. The bus to the city passes by right outside  the unit and there is easy street parking right out front. Negatives? None that we could think of. We wish Bernadette could control the weather!"
2016-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,6404761,David,"This was my first airbnb and I think I struck gold. Robyn and Ken were the perfect hosts and made me feel at home from the time I first arrived to the time I left.
I would recommend this airbnb to anyone who wants the perfect hosts in a very convenient location."
2016-07-05T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Amanda,"Very beautiful, stylish and comfortable apartment. Everything you need is here and the location is very convenient. 
Host very responsive and helpful. 
If you like to sleep in a dark, quiet room, I advise you to have an eye mask and ear plugs. It is light outside and the blinds don't quite shut it all out. "
2018-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,6170899,Jan,"Jennifer has been a great host! We have enjoyed our stay at Jennifer's house for the past 7 nights. The kitchen is well equipped with utensils and other supplies like bread, milk and eggs. The interiors are based on traditional English design and we felt peaceful, warm and cosy in the house.
Highly recommended!"

2017-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Karen,"I stayed here for twelve days, as I had various business meetings in the city. It was a perfect location. A great little neighbourhood with good transport links to get around Sydney.  Linda was a great host and was very flexible with check-in and check-out times. The apartment was clean and comfortable and was equipped with basic equipment. It was perfect for me on my own and for putting up a friend overnight on the sofa bed. Good value for money."
2017-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Renee,"Great comfortable little apartment for a business trip.  Full size ironing board and good quality iron was nice.  Later check in meant I had to get the keys from another location which was easy enough, just a little annoying."
2017-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,8277472,Philip,"Charming obliging and gracious hosts, generous and accommodating. The room is pleasant and well-furnished, with a large comfortable bed. Small thing missing, I'd have liked a bedside table. Bathroom perfect. Would certainly recommend to anyone, and I'll check if the room is available next time I'm in that part of the world."

She let me check in very early due to my red-eye flight and she also let me check out very late due to my late evening flight home. The place was beautiful, spotlessly clean and is in a prime Potts point / Elizabeth Bay location. Thank you so much for making my stay in Sydney so enjoyable. "
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,15312988,Inga,"Tolles Zimmer mit einem sehr sauberen Bad in unmittelbarer Umgebung zum Coogee Beach. Zu Fuß ist dieser in 10 Minuten zu erreichen. Cindy und ihr Mann sind jederzeit für Fragen zu erreichen und ein super Gastgeber. Ein Zimmer welches ich sofort weiterempfehlen kann, hier bist du für einen Aufenthalt in Sydney perfekt aufgehoben."

2016-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Debbie,"Rachel's house is lovely. We were a family of 5 in Sydney for my son's wedding at Balmoral and this spot was perfect for very easy access to Mosman shopping centre, buses to the city and Balmoral Beach. We parked the car and basically didn't use it again the entire weekend.
There is only one full bathroom however so if you don't like sharing then maybe not for you. We had no problem as it is a huge bathroom and there is another toilet in the laundry/3rd bedroom.
The house is spacious with lots of places to 'escape' for quiet time"
2014-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Amanda,"I have so many great things to say about my 4 week stay with Natasa that I don't know where to start!  Natasa is very welcoming, and she made me feel right at home from the moment I got there.  She is generous and flexible--and one of the happiest people to be around.  Natasa always had the perfect suggestion of where to go, what to do or the best way to get there.  She knows the city really well, and is always happy to give suggestions (or show you herself!).  Natasa will talk with you as much or as little as you want, but we had a great time hanging out downstairs--I never felt like I needed to be in my room.  She even invited me to her famous pizza night with her friends--yum!

As for the house/room--it was great.  The location is amazing--so close to both the Petersham train station and a short walk to all of the Parramatta Rd buses.  Everything you need will be close by or short walk away.  The house is great--clean, homely and has everything you need! The green room was perfect--great hard wood floors, comfortable bed, plenty of space for my things--as advertised.  Even with 3 or 4 of us in the house, I never had to wait for the bathroom--everyone had such different schedules that it always seemed to work out.  I did laundry quite a few times while I was there, which was no problem at all--there is a dryer or clothes line.  

I would not hesitate for a second to book this house again!  It made my time working away from home so much better by being around lovely people in a very nice home.  I loved it and I hope I get the chance to visit Natasa in Petersham again soon!"

2018-06-19T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Theresa,Nice house near to SYD CBD area. Car is not recommended as the parking fee is expensive. Public transport and MRT can be accessed easily. No concern in getting nice food nearly.
2016-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Susie,"Hernans place was perfect for a solo traveler staying near the airport! I was able to visit the city, you just have to get to the train station which Hernan kindly took me to! He was a great host and very easy to talk to!"
2016-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,6404761,Tilly,Robyn and Ken were the perfect hosts. Went way beyond normal host efforts to ensure our comfort of needs. Delightful experience and we will be back.

With your own entrance, ensuite bathroom and the extra touches of soda water in the fridge, nespesso coffee machine, fruit yogurt and muesli for breakie and beach towels for use, it was a treat. The room was spotless, with modern bathroom and decorated beautifully. Cathy was even helpful enough to arrange a fan in the room for us prior to arrival as we had been having some very hot weather of late. Just fantastic!"
2018-06-16T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Snoozle,Well equipped and spacious for our family to stay and enjoy Maroubra. Great spot. Close to beach and shops.
2016-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Marianne,We had a great long weekend at this place. Would highly recommended it.
2018-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,13852692,Mindy,The house is a lot more run down than it looks on the photographs provided. Beds were dusty which resulted in my developing hives on my first night there. Air-conditioning is only available in the kitchen and in one of the toilets. There is a step near the kitchen which can be quite dangerous because its not clearly marked. Both my grandparents missed the step and they nearly fell. Do be prepared to walk uphill from the train station to the home.

2015-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,4499095,Yvon,"We were lucky to have booked Dino's place last minute as we decided to stay longer in Sydney. The appt is quite popular and there are good reasons for that!

Communication & Check in
Fast feedback and smooth communication although Dino was in a different timezone when we booked. Rick helped us to check in and was real friendly and showed us around in the house.

Location
Was just perfect. Quite central and can walk to all the major popular area's. Also very close to King's cross and Wooloomooloo but the street is nice and quite. Also within 5-min walking distance to good super market and upscale dining. 

The appartment
We are also really big on modern interirors and designs. Dino's the place was a real gem. You cann see that he has invested substantial enegery and money to decorate but also to maintain the place. Top quality materials everywhere, but also top quality amenities. Dino really cares. Everything is custom made and built in, which made the appartment feel real spacious without compromising on the number of facilities. We were with the two of us, but the sofa bed in the study room can cater for another 2 if needed.

Facilities
Everything worked perfectly, but we really loved the floor heating in the bathroom as spring was just starting and Sydney was still quite chilly. Dino also had his own parking space, which was a real plus as parking can get quite pricey in Sydney. 

The bed was comfy and Dino had a nice selection of books and cd's which made the stay really enjoyable as well.

2018-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Melanie,This place is amazing. As soon as I walked into the apartment I knew I was going to love every moment of staying here. The place is decorated so nicely and thoughtfully. Very nice neighborhood with a small venue of food places and groceries 5 min walk.  The views from the apartment are lovely and the host is extremely nice and always replies to questions quickly.  Riding the ferry into town is a treat but there is also a train for quicker service.  Would definitely stay again.
2019-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Amanda,We had a lovely overnight stay. Very comfortable and well equipped room which included terrific breakfast. Clareville shopping centre only a short walk away for a great cup of coffee

2017-06-01T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Nathan Stephen,"The previous reviews this location are mostly accurate but we did want to point out a few details. Pros: The location of the apartment is excellent. Easy access to the train, taxis, as well as the ability to walk to just about anywhere in town. We had a lovely stroll from the apartment to the Sydney Bridge, Darling Harbour, and Circular Quay. There are many local restaurants and pubs to visit, we did not go hungry! The house manual has many wonderful suggestions. Cons: We recognize that these may be exclusive to our experience only. While communication with Paul and Luke was great, we did have some hiccups. As international travelers, we had been using WiFi wherever available so as to not incur any additional charges. We set up a time for Wendy (the housekeeper), to meet us to drop off the key. We waited 20 minutes until having to turn on our phones to try to sort out where Wendy was. After texting Wendy 3 times, she responded that she had left he key with a local business owner. It was frustrating that the plan had changed, that we weren’t notified immediately, and that we had to find this out after having to incur international phone charges. The apartment itself is as advertised. Cozy, lovely style, mostly well maintained. The double bed is a bit lumpy for our taste. The washroom/toilet is a bit dated, and could use a deep clean. The tub is rounded at the bottom so you could never stand with flat feet, it was quite slippery. While the tub is large, note that the shower is rather small and the shower head does not move. You are restricted to a small, rather tight area, as the shower curtain only encloses a small circular space around the shower head. Neither of us could close the curtain fully around us. The water pressure and hot water is outstanding. As pointed out, the street in which the apartment is located is quite noisy with bright street lights gleaming in that the blinds don’t fully block out, so lite sleepers beware, but that is a part of the city experience. Also note that the building is older. The entrance way is dark and has a musty smell. There were plenty of stairs to walk up, so if you have heavy luggage, beware. Online, the check-out time states 10am, though the manual at the apartment states 11am. Having thought the checkout time was at 11am, we were finishing packing and showering when Wendy, knocked at a bit past 10am. She was extremely abrupt, to the point of being rude. She insisted that the check out time was 10am, and suggested twice that we should have ‘checked our email’. She also brought a tradesman with her and was wanting to come in with him to start cleaning. I told her that my husband was in the shower and I did not feel comfortable having her and another person inside the apartment..."

Rapport qualité/prix très bon. La maison est très propre. 
Bruyant si vous êtes dans la chambre du bas située côté route.
C'est un backpaker et non une chambre chez l'habitant."

2018-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Ann,"The view and location are fantastic.
The apartment is on the 3rd floor and there is no lift, but it was not a problem for us.
The apartment was excellent value for three people.
The washing machine and dryer are not located in the apartment, once again not really a problem to go up to the next level.
The leaking ceiling and mould is a major problem.  We didn't get a lot of rain, but the floor around the sunroom bed was very wet.  Not sure what happens in winter?
The toilet seems to have been ""broken"" for weeks.  Hopefully, fixed the day we left.
Mal was excellent, responded quickly and helped with any problems."

The Maroubra ""Seals Club"" near by offered a venue which could easily cater for our large group providing great meals at cheap prices."
2017-04-25T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Pete,"We had a wonderful stay. It was quiet, relaxing and very comfortable. Belinda and Chris are great hosts. The cabin is set in leafy garden minutes from the beach and it has a private entrance. The kitchen is well-equipped. "
2016-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Ramona,"Die Unterkunft liegt ca. 20min zu Fuß vom Zentrum entfernt. Der Check- in verlief unkompliziert, Viktoria war vor Ort und hat uns viele gute Tipps für Sydney gegeben.  Es gibt sehr viele gute Restaurants und Cafe's in der Nähe. 
Das Appartement war 
sehr sauber, ausreichend groß und das ausklappbare Bett war sehr bequem. Eine kleine Küchennische war ebenfalls vorhanden, wo man alles für ein kleines Frühstück finden konnte. 
Wir würden auf jeden Fall diese Unterkunft noch einmal wählen! "

2016-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Louise,"A fantastic place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of Sydney but still close to all of the action. Soaking up the morning sun with a cup of tea, a croissant and a good book - pure bliss. Cath sure knows how to make you feel at home, with fresh bread and a well-stocked kitchen. Oh, and a very comfortable bed! Pop down the road to Cornersmith Cafe for a delicious breakfast or read a book under the big trees in the park at the end of the street. I wish I could have stayed longer - I definitely plan to come back!"

2017-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,20578419,Amy,"This is a charming apartment in a great location. Easy walking distance to many places and just a block from the train if using public transportation.  Unfortunately our TV did not work (not that we were using it much) to Su's credit, it was changed the next day. However, the wifi then broke, which left us a drift as we did not have a local phone and could only communicate via texting. Overall, lovely apartment. If you plan to cook any meals, be warned the kitchen is not well stocked. bring your own French press if you can't wait to visit one of the wonderful cafe's near by. Overall , good value with. A few glitches to be worked out."
2019-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Minna,Great location! Within walking distance to the Manly harbour ferry. The place was very clean and the bed was comfy.

2018-03-19T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Paul,"A great space in the heart of Manly, one of the best suburbs in Sydney. While it is an older style apartment it  very spacious, comfortable  and has all the facilities you will need for a short or even long term stay. We've stayed in a few air bnb apartments in Europe and this one is certainly up to standard. Recommended!"
2015-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Kerry,Cathys place in Avalon is beautifully furnished with a huge very very comfortable bed. Cathy is a warm and welcoming host who made our stay very lovely. I would highly recommend staying here to explore the beautiful area.

It was clean, comfortable, practical and beautifully decorated. Bed was cosy and neatly arranged. You have everything you need: clean and private bathroom ensuite, wall-mounted TV and a delicious and healthy breakfast, which you can enjoy on a nice table outside the room. I would highly recommend this place to everyone staying in Avalon as it is perfectly located and well priced. We would love to go back to this quiet and lovely place soon."

The apartment was very spacious and spotlessly clean on arrival and has absolutely everything you need for a home from home experience and more, which helps when travelling with small children. We could not have wanted a more perfect place to stay with our little boy and with such amazing views. This is by far the best airbnb we have ever stayed in over all our experiences throughout the world. Thank you."
2017-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Angus,"This is a lovely apartment for a couple. Well fitted out, a few essentials for eating in and decorated with a very tasteful African theme. During the cool winter evenings, the reverse cycle heaters were fantastic. Traffic noise was well muted by the double glass in the bedroom. Desireé was very communicative through our stay and had provided lots of info about Sydney and what to do, where to eat, etc. "
2013-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Kylie,Lovely private little cabin in the back garden with en suite. Susan is a friendly and helpful host. Angelo the cat is also friendly.

Thank you to Angela for making our stay so special. Every little detail had been thought about and Angela went above and beyond to make us feel so comfortable.
It is stunning accommodation like this and wonderful hosts that make a getaway so perfect and memorable.

Thank you! xo"
2016-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Hyacinth,"Nicole met us at the loft and went over the TV, Wifi, etc., - we were totally impressed as this did not happen at the places we stayed in  Cairns & the Brisbane area (those hosts were only available by email/phone/text which was welcomed).
We loved this loft which was perfect for our 6 nights in Sydney. 
Nicole had thought of everything and supplied it which was wonderful, location is perfect for public transport, restaurants, sight-seeing, etc.,
The only negative was the work going on outside from around 7:30 - 4pm - demolishing of a building opposite the loft - it was pretty noisy at times.  
Nicole mentioned it was temporary and she apologized that it was happening (she shared that she had just  found out about the demolition recently). 
We would defintely stay here again when in Sydney - it was the best place we have stayed in during our 3 week travel across Australia.
We will definitely encourage friends to stay here too if they travel to Sydney."

The keys were given to me 4h late.
The entire place was very dirty.
Not even vacuumed.
No Space for hanging or even shelf’s for personal staff ,all full of hosts things like if they were living there.
Floor in the living area full of plastic toys,which were always in the way.
Kitchen sticky, the walls and all.
Pantry full of half started smelly ingredients.
Under the sofas and the rest of furniture dust,dirt,lost items including old passport,combs etc.
Dryer in the laundry with dirt from weeks and weeks.
Balcon-more of the same -dirt and storage for the host .
I have pictures to show.
Never will I look at this place again and I would not recommend it to anyone who doesn’t like filth."
2019-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Diana,"Great place to stay. Safe neighbourhood that isn't far from the station (10 minute walk) along pretty tree lined streets with late Victorian houses, many with iron lacework balconies. The main room was very clean, airy and the bed was comfortable. Loved the over head fan which kept me nice and cool. The bathroom was equally very clean and the shower worked well. Good coffee making facilities and well equipped kitchenette."

Suzanna was also lightning fast in replying, and is very patient and helpful with all my queries. We had a very pleasant stay in the clean house.

Apartment is in a new building, however for our visit it hadn't been thoroughly cleaned. Photos on listing didn't seem to match exactly with actual apartment. Good location near Surry Hills and Ultimo."

2018-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,21612973,Stuart,It's a lovely place in a great location.  The hosts are very friendly and helpful.
2015-08-16T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Weiling,"The location of the house is indeed situated near to Newtown Station and a few bus stops. Check in and check out were a breeze, and the rooms looked exactly like that in the photos. Instructions and help were readily available at any time.

Breakfast and necessities were refilled very frequently and we never had to worry about running out of food or necessities. 

Miss D and her husband were extremely helpful and provided us with some really great recommendations for food places! We would definitely recommend Miss D's place to anyone looking to stay in the area and we cant wait to come back again. :)

Just a tip for lone travellers - it does get quite dark at night on the street leading to the apartment, so best if you get back to the apartment before nightfall or just carry a flashlight with you. "
2018-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Nicole,"Had an amazing stay, the place was lovely, clean and such an easy stay."
2016-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Heather,"With good communication from the start, Linda made the process easy. She gave clear instructions to pick up the key, use the wifi and left maps with advice on places to visit. The location was perfect for us; near family and the railway station.  We hired bikes from over the road ($20 for half day) and cycled to Balmain. Great cycling along the river but busy roads. You can walk to the city centre- we walked offroad through parks to Darling Harbour and the botanical gardens. Comfy big bed with good quality bedding and loads of hot water. Everything else was a bonus. Glad there was a heater as our first evenings were chilly and a television to watch the Olympics. The wifi was welcome. The Eveleigh Hotel opposite had good meals but we mainly shopped at Coles in Broadway and Spar opposite the station. We thought of hiring a car so the car parking space was a plus but actually travelled everywhere by the excellent public transport. The Opal app was really helpful; we already had Opal cards. It's a modern block that looks a little prison-like compared to the cute houses in the rest of the street but is big enough and well-equipped. 
There's a big sofa which converts into a big sofa bed. The upstairs bedroom has no door, it's a railing but a good size and watching tv on low downstairs was ok and didn't disturb the sleeper. I would stay there again."
2016-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Sam,"Had a wonderful stay, Cath was the perfect host, a well thought out space with everything you need.

A word or warning: if you're driving parking is all metered at a rate of $7 an hour so it works out very expensive if you're not planning to drive around whilst you're staying. 

Mal was a great host and very accommodating - some great suggestions for dining and drinking in the local area. 

Wifi was very handy to look up places to visit. Would definitely recommend this place to others!"
2018-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,2660996,Michael,Doris is a great host. She went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and our stay was enjoyable. We liked it so much we are staying again next week.
2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,21988560,Mizuki,They have a super host literally. The room was cozy and sparkling clean! The mattress is awesome I went to sleep soon as my head hit the pillow.
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,8356824,Cara,"We had a great experience in Sandra's place! It was wonderful being just a few minutes away from the beach and heart of Bondi, and Sandra's place was very clean and well kept. In addition, we appreciated her thorough directions, great food/drink recommendations, quick response times, and hospitality all the way through.  We would definitely stay here again!"
2018-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,20865085,Madeleine,"Perfectly clean, modern facilities, ocean view, great access to public transport, quiet neighbourhood. As a young couple, Jenny’s space was perfect for our weekend getaway!"
2017-03-07T05:00:00.000Z,8559496,Markus,"It was a great time at Tigers place. His flat is clean and beautiful and directly over the train station. 
Tiger is very helpful and makes your time in Sydney more comfortable. "
2017-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Jaye,"A gorgeous townhouse, with old world charm and modern features. The location is great, really central with yummy cafes within walking distance. Parking was easy too. The furnishings were all lovely and the kitchen is a great size and well equipped.

The bedroom was cosy with a sunroom at the front which was great to relax in, have a chat or read a book with a glass of wine. 

We'd definitely look to stay again next time we're visiting Sydney. 

"
2015-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Meinrad,We had just a perfect time in susan and gregs garden. They are so helpful an welcoming.
2015-05-04T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Isabelle,"Thank you for hosting us MissD! Quick and helpful in responses to queries and on matters of check-in, settling in and check-in! A pleasant stay with clean linen and fresh towels arranged asap in order with our check-in. The room and common areas were kept spick & span and decorated to give a homey feeling. Host and her husband were friendly and did their utmost to make all occupants happy with their stay! "
2016-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,15332652,Mohan,Lilian is a good host. She has welcomed me with a smile and made sure I know everything about my accommodation. Her communication is very good and made sure she managed every small thing. Will stay with her again. Lilian's location is very close to Redfern train station and it saved me a lot of time.
2017-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Chika,Very clean and nice room!
2019-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Ines,"Nice and clean studio, everything as described. The bathroom is very modern and very clean. Bedsheets and towels as well as milk, coffee and cereals provided.

But keep in mind: If you are looking for a perfectly private accommodation this isn't it. You have your own room with your own front door. However, to get to your bathroom you need to use the hall the family also uses. There is a six-foot high partition in the hall but of course you can be heard/can hear when entering the bathroom etc.. Also not having a sink in your room can be a little awkward - although Michele offers to do your dishes if you send her an e-mail and leave the stuff by the partition. It's kind of like sharing a flat without talking to each other but hearing there is someone next door. Still, the family is very quite so if you don't mind that, it's fine.

Newtown is the perfect location to discover Sidney, many botique shops and hip restaurants - it costs around 3 Aus $ to get to city centre by train; 10 mins walk to the station."
2019-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Laura,Hernan was a lovely host. His apartment was the perfect place to recover after my long flight. The beach is a very short walk away and perfect for a nice walk or a swim. There are also good restaurants and cafes a short walk away! 10/10 would stay again
2018-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,1321603,Andrew,"Dangar Island has a special quality of itself, and there is probably nowhere better to experience it than Ann's home. With a style and atmosphere that is warm and inviting, overlooking the beautiful Hawkesbury this is a great place to just watch to boats go by from the balcony or, if you like, get the lowdown on the history of the island or a tour of the garden. Thanks Ann also for going to so much trouble to accommodate for my vegan dietary requirements!"
2018-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Greg,Overall great accommodation in a lovely location and a hospitable host.
2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Damien,We had a pleasant stay at Cathy’s place. The room is quite narrow but clean and well located at convenient distance from the beach and a couple of cafes. Cathy gave us a very warm welcome at our arrival which was great.
2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,21939239,Charlotte,"Unfortunately my stay with Don was cut short as he changed his mind about allowing my dog to stay with me, but other than this the apartment is perfect in every way. It’s a great area and well equipped, and I’d definitely recommend it especially for shorter stays. While I was disappointed in my stay - I understand it was a very particular situation that will probably not apply to future guests as I imagine Don will now implement a strict no-pets policy."
2018-09-12T04:00:00.000Z,26474245,Mottel,This is simply the best possible location if you’re planning a trip to Coogee. The apartment was immaculately clean and Leigh was super helpful and responsive with check-in/out. The apartment has high ceilings and an abundance of natural light. We’ll be back.
2013-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,501382,Tudor,"Spotless Sydney apartment for a decent price, that hidden gem that we are all secretly looking for. There are few things better than having breakfast on the balcony, on a sunny day, and stalking parrots from nearby trees. Louise was a great host and cared to our every need."
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,19508741,Denise & Richard,"A lovely place in great location with a true quintessential B&B experience including home made muffins and jams.  Very hospitable, flexible and responsive hosts.  "
2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,17438054,Laura,"George and Lucia’s home was beyond wonderful! A beautifully relaxing stay with everything and anything you could need! They were wonderful hosts, very thoughtful, easy to communicate with, and always happy to offer help or assistance! Their granny flat is very private and a cozy little oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Sydney, but with shops, trains and facilities a quick walk away! Perfect for any travellers needs!
Can’t express how wonderful their Airbnb really is!"
2016-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Steve,Nice place :)
2016-04-04T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Felicity,"What a great place!!! Location was brilliant! So close to the beach & cafe's 
The house fit is very comfortably! Everything you need is there. Just add food! Great first experience! Thanks so much "
2018-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,22295401,Jo,It’s wonderful place. Very close to station
2018-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,5116907,David,"The apartment is conveniently located in a quiet suburban Bondi street but close enough to walk to the  beach and local cafes, so it's very handy. A clean and comfortable home away from home. Anthony is an awesome host who is very responsive to questions and give lots of useful local tips. Will definitely recommend it for a pleasant stay in Bondi Beach. Nice welcome touch on self-check in :-)"
2016-03-13T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Richard,"Lovely room, good setting, good communication. Many thanks"
2018-03-10T05:00:00.000Z,1979960,Margie,This property is in a fantastic location so central to the city. Jeremy is a fantastic host who went out of his way to ensure our stay was hassle free. Exceptional communication replying swiftly to any messages. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and loved that our whole extended family could be together. Would definitely stay at this property again and would recommend it to others needing a central location.
2018-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Gurbachan,Great location and very clean. Amazing
2015-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Lily,The house is really cool just like a art gallery.And it is very regrettable that we did not meet the host because we only stay for one night.But I think they must be very nice because our plane arrived late and the host left a lot of sticky note to help us know more about the house.That is really very sweet!
2016-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Lani,"This was a quiet, extremely clean, and cozy place to stay after a 11 hr. flight, and was only 10 min. away from the Sydney airport (about $18 taxi fair). I found everything I needed from internet code printed with local maps. I had to wait for my ride to arrive and I was able to wait in the common room and was even given coffee. I highly recommend this very nice and private granny flat. Thank you for the welcoming hospitality! I will stay again if come back to NSW, Australia. "
2019-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,22297561,Sam,Well setup space for the size. Had everything I needed for my work trip. Would stay here again.
2018-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Shahin,Natasa is one of the nicest people you’ll come across! Her home is lovely and cozy and close to public transport stops
2018-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Stephen,Great location. Good value for money
2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,19574869,Sam,"Great location. Bed was broken, but other than that was good."
2018-09-12T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Faye,Exactly what you need for a short stay.
2017-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,13299549,Robyn,"This appartment is in a fabulous location everything is so close and easy to get to, we had 2 teenage kids with us and all felt safe in the appartment and out on the street, there are fantastic restaurants and market food, bars everywhere it's a lovely short walk to the opera house area the botanical gardens and the city shopping. It was clean and bright with a nice pool on the roof, the only let down was the bathroom is very small and the little things that you expect would to be provided such as salt pepper a roll of toilet paper, sponges an extra tea towel etc are not 
However there are plenty of quality towels and spare linen provided 
The appartment has a very good air conditioning system and the beds are very comfortable "
2016-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Sierra,"The apartment is in a great location in Potts Point.  There are many restaurants, cafes, and markets right outside the door.  We really enjoyed our time!"
2018-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Sue,"The place was really excellent.  We were 5 women having a night in Sydney for a show and finding somewhere for 5 single people to sleep was amazing.  We could quite comfortable have been a family of 7 as 2 of the beds were queens.  The location was great. It is very central and convenient.  We could walk easily to the shops, restaurants and Town Hall station.  The beds were all comfortable as were the couches in the living room.  It was very clean with plenty of nice toiletries.  Danny is a wonderful host and the price was very reasonable.  I would highly recommend this place.  "
2015-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,4164487,Kim,"It was our first time staying with airbnb and we couldn't have wished for a better start.
Their place is very nice, clean and comfortable. Ashlee and Duncan were nice hosts and we enjoyed the conversations which were quite entertaining as well not to forget the nice self made honey we had! :)
It was handy to be so close to the city and it was easy to get there as it's just one bus stop.

Thanks for accommodation us.
Cheers,
Mathilda and Kim"
2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,4499095,Cathy,"Dino's apartment is just perfect. Beautiful, very well equipped in a dream neighbourhood for foodies. Dino is also the perfect host. Thank you."
2018-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Tina,This place is amazing!! The house and views are better than expected and everything is provided so all you have to do is relax or for those that’s up for adventure there’s so much happening around the area. Bailey has been great and we have already booked to stay again during the new year weekend!
2018-06-07T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Elliott,"Awesome host, very friendly and helpful. Highy recomend!"
2018-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,22124796,Jaco,Great location and a great appartment in general. Places like these are why I prefer AirBnb above hotels.
2018-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,22295401,Calum,"Great little place to stay for a couple, excellent location, just a street up from the train station, Holey Moley and restaurants and coles. We felt very safe around the area, considering the bad reputation Kings Cross has, and being told we were next to a Gentlemen’s Club. Would recommend, perfect for a couple."
2016-12-23T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Gözde,Susan was friendly and helpful.
2015-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,8121226,Mark,"Great place to stay, the apartment has everything you could ask for. 

Jenny is very accommodating.

It was just like staying in a hotel. 

I'd recommend staying if you are after an alternative to a hotel suite. 

I would stay again. 
"
2017-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Simone,The location of Paul's apartment is perfect. It's extremely close to the Manly Wharf and a smaller beach which was great for the kids. Paul was very responsive and helpful. We had a great holiday and were really happy we chose Paul's apartment for our stay.
2013-06-08T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Meg,Hernan and Connie were wonderful and friendly hosts. Their appartment has a great vibe and is a short walk from the Bay Street shops and restaurants. Their place was an ideal place for me while I was attending a conference at the Brighton le sands Novotel.. Thanks again!
2016-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Jihye,굿
2016-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,13442098,Richard,Very good. Came to this place on short notice (1 hour) after talking to the host. There are a number of wifi networks in the unit but the host made sure I could connect easily and everything went well. Host left fruit and chocolate too which I didn't eat but was very thoughtful! Top marks!
2019-01-31T05:00:00.000Z,20374683,Sunny,"房东实在太好了,不光给了我们各种当地的出行建议,还配合我们的行程给予了不少方便,让我们可以放心去玩,不需要担心行李问题,特别友好贴心｡更给力的是,当天晚上我们离开,叫不到的士,房东二话不说帮我们沟通并让我们成功顺利坐上了的士｡感激不尽,在异国他乡,有这么乐于助人,友好的同胞｡下次如果再去悉尼,也会选择这里｡"

Very central location with a quiet room and super fun hosts, it s the perfect place to get social, 
Miss you already guys, I ll be back !"
2016-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,1979960,Yudong,"It was a really nice stay! The location is perfect, and everything you might need is just within walking distance or a short drive. Everything in the house is well signed and it just took us a sec to find the things we needed. Jeremy is a awesome host! Big thanks from my families and me!"
2018-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Anthony,Ollie is a fantastic host! The place is perfect and located centrally to near everything by either walking or transit.

2017-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Ellen,"Easy and welcoming communication before we arrived.Arriving late at night was no problem at all.The place was spotless,well equipped,comfortable and beautiful (Website hidden by Airbnb) not expect to have fresh fruit,coffee,tea,shampoo etc. provided,awesome!The place was an entirely private section of a family home,perfectly cool on a hot summer day and very close to all great things in Newtown.Would certainly stay there again!"
2016-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Ng,"Didn't had the chance to meet our host, but she was extremely helpful and provide us great suggestion on places to go and how to get around.

Went the extra mile by providing us some basic groceries as we had an extended stay. Which was a pleasant surprise :) highly recommend 

Place was very clean :)"
2016-05-22T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Louis And Allie,"Mal was very nice and arrived with some groceries and fresh flowers a few hours into my stay and also shared with me some favorite spots to visit in the neighborhood! 

Overall, a really nice place to stay - great location in North Bondi, easy check-in process, good communication leading up to the stay, and it felt very safe (for a solo woman). Mal was great with offering to let me check out later on Sunday if it was better for my flight schedule.

I would not describe the apartment as ""luxury"" as the post does, but it could be there with some minor improvements. I did love the natural light and high ceilings! 

The apartment building was quite loud many of the nights (thurs/fri/sat), but that's no fault to Mal of course, just the neighbors. They typically quieted down by around midnight or one - and it is Bondi after all - nothing that wasn't solved with a pair of earplugs."
2019-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,16166535,Genevieve,"My partner and I were really happy with our stay! Gorgeous home, full of character and even lovelier hosts~
We definitely reccomend~"
2018-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Justine,"Our stay at Beach Escape was terrific. The location is incredible and although it doesn't have it's own private jetty, there is a public one 100m away. We spent the days boating on beautiful Pittwater and at the basin and retreated back to the house at dusk. Bailey's house in fabulous, with incredible views across Pittwater. Each level has a lounge room and private space for guests. We certainly would love to come back and stay at the Beach Escape."
2018-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,20578419,Jesse,"The location was perfect for us, very close to both Central Station (and therefore the airport), and cafes and shops around Surry Hills and Oxford Street. The apartment is larger than we expected and was nice and clean. Having an additional set of keys readily available for larger groups of people would be good to save some hassles."
2015-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,5581269,Charley,"Michy is a gorgeous host, willing to help in thoughtful ways to make her guests feel welcome and comfortable. The space is lovely. Quiet neighbourhood very close to the water with good coffee at a nearby restaurant. Other features of the area accessible by bus or car. I didn't want to leave and hope to return another time."
2019-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,12259367,John,Perfectly ok for the business trip I used it for. It is obviously a former hotel. its a little tired but comfortable enough. It's on the fringe of the city rather than central cbd but train station fairly close. Lots of cooking smells from adjoining apartments which was a bit annoying. It has a good gym with equipment that seems pretty  much brand new. I didn't use the pool but it looked good.
2019-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,22068048,Yaoxiang,"It’s an awesome place more than our expectations. The hospitality, warmth and passion from Lucy and Ralphs impressed us a lot. Frankly speaking, Lucy and Ralphs are the best householder we met in the world. We will choose the same place without any hesitation if we come back to Sydney next time!"
2015-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,2609433,Jovita,"I enjoyed every moment of my stay in this house - full of light, style, harmony and fresh smell of flowers. But the most important that due to my stay in Cecilia's house, I found my own people, who are searching for something more and strive for bigger in their lives. I loved this experience of sharing, learning and living together like a family. Definitely, my time in Sydney was so amazing thanks to this exceptional chance to live in this lovely house.      "
2016-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,12256344,Steve,"Paul, Judith and Tim were really friendly and welcoming and I felt at home immediately. The house is so well situated for travelling to city or beaches, its a great place to stay in Sydney."
2018-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,21971876,Cicilia,Juliette's house was amazing and beautiful. I love the city view from her dining room. her childrens are very lovely. Thankyou for the place :)
2017-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Claire,"Natasa was absolutely lovely. She described how to get to her place in great detail and even helped me put with my Uber on the last day.
Her place was cosy and she even took me out around Sydney!
Her place is literally next to the train station which works great if you don't drive in Sydney.
She had a dozen types of teas for me to select from and also gave me recommendations for things to visit.
I felt very welcomed and at home - as though I had been living there for months!
Would definitely stay there again and hang out with Natasa. :)"
2017-07-01T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Sue,"We were very happy with our stay at the cottage. It is in a great location for public transport including buses, light rail & rail. The local shops at Dulwich Hill have all your grocery needs with lots of great cafes & bars to choose from. The internet was great & Netflix was a nice bonus. Patrick & Christine responded immediately to nay issues or queries we had. The appliances were modern & worked well. Bedding was of a high quality & the bed very comfortable. Everything was as listed on the amenities site. The pantry items & consumables supplied were a lovely bonus. The only downside was that the 2 radiators were inadequate for the area to be heated. We would recommend this cottage."
2018-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Ben,"Great apartment in a quiet complex. 

Mohit was a great host and very responsive to questions and assisting with check in and check out.

Would highly recommend and would stay again"

She is quick to respond to any needs and goes out of her way to make your stay as easy as possible. Her accommodation is clean, warm and inviting. She really has furnished the place with style and thoughtfulness. We loved our stay!"

화장실이 다소 물조절하는 방식이 낯설고 옛날 방식인 것과 와이파이가 ADSL이라 느린점을 제외하고는 정말 만족했다."
2015-08-30T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Steve,Susan again made our Sydney stay memorable.We can't recommend her highly enough.she is a deserved Super Host!
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,31134257,Mehak,Hong is a lively and wonderful lady. She has a heart of gold. She kept us very comfortable and treated just like her own family. Provided us with the privacy we wanted. The place was wonderful. House was cosy and the room was sparkling clean and bed was very much comfortable.  She also provided us the crib for our toddler. She has a lovely and friendly dog. She went out of the way to provide us comfort. Also she hosted a wonderful New year day lunch for guests. The room also had an AC which was much needed in warm nights of December. Highly recommend to everyone.

2018-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,21637487,Ellie,"Wonderfully clean and stylish apartment steps from the beach - I even considered missing my flight home to stay longer! Kasey is an amazing and responsive host, could not recommend the apartment more highly!"

2018-07-02T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Pete,"This place was in a fantastic location and we could walk or catch transport to most places.
The reviews did not make it clear that there are 2 separate apartments within the property and we had the studio.
It was very small but adequate for the two of us and we were out most of the time. Great shower. Would recommend for short stays."
2018-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Tan,"Great neat and tidy place, modern and in a very good neighbourhood. Easy street parking ."

2018-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,22020910,Tamara,Anita was a fantastic host and went above and beyond. This was my second time in Bondi Beach and next time I visit I’ll be staying here again. 5 stars! The location is central to all the Bondi has to offer. It’s near a busy street but with the windows closed you don’t hear much.
2018-06-22T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Stephen,Great place for a big group! Very clean and easy to get to.
2016-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Earl,Rachel was super! Everything was found as described and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her lovely house in Mossman! It was perfect for us as we had a wedding to attend at Balmoral Beach which is not too far away.

2015-11-02T05:00:00.000Z,7439246,Chrissy,"This was our first time using Airbnb and we had a really positive experience.  Nathan was very quick to respond to our messages and was very easy to deal with.  We appreciated Nathan and April's recommendations, which were very helpful.  The apartment was exactly as described.  It has been set up really nicely and is light and airy, clean and comfortable.  The kids' room in particular is great.  The apartment is in a perfect location, being just across from the beach but still quiet at night.  We really enjoyed our stay here.  Highly recommended!     "
2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,20578419,Hannah,"A great place to stay, would definitely recommend. a wonderful location with a nice modern feel, only issue is the host took multiple messages to reply."

2017-09-03T04:00:00.000Z,1944996,Elizabeth,"Annie's place was incredible - smack bang in the middle of everything but the apartment itself seemed secluded from the noise of the streets below. Walking distance to oxford street and all the call bars in Surry Hills, really couldn't ask for a better location! Annie's apartment had everything you could think of and more, and Annie was accommodating and a pleasure to deal with :) We couldn't recommend Annie's apartment highly enough!"
2017-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,20767798,Fernan,Its very close to everything and Ann was very nice! Highly recommended!

2017-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,14886923,Michael,"The location of this property was central to transport - an easy train ride in from the airport and short walk from museum station

Lots of communication from the host.

The property was nothing special - served its purpose - wouldn't rush back in a hurry - hosts could do a lot more to make the property more accommodating for business guests

2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,2838442,Graham,"I had a great stay, lovely place and even lovelier host."

Anitta's directions were flawless and incredibly helpful making check-in a breeze. This apartment is close public transportation and it is easy to get anywhere in Sydeny. This unit felt very private even with lots of windows and natural light. We loved it!"
2018-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Eleni,Everthing was perfect!
2014-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Jason,What a cool house!  A great way to stimulate the creative mind while staying in comfort. The bedroom was very comfortable and the hosts were really nice. Great historic area with cafes and little specialty shops just around the corner. This quickly became my favorite airbnb place.
2017-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Linden,"My partner and I stayed here for our babymoon and it was magnificent. Beautiful space, really friendly hosts and fantastic location. Has everything you need (loved the Foxtel and bath!) and Avalon is such a great location year round with fantastic restaurants and great walks/beach. We had the best time. Highly recommend. "
2017-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Kathrin,"Evelyn and Anthony are wonderful hosts. Always available and approachable while at the same time totally respecting one's privacy. Helpful with tips on local to dos, very hospitable, flexible and proactive (e.g. towel and linen change during our 10 days stay).

The place itself is a great choice as well: stunning views over Pittwater Bay, fully equipped and tastefully furnished. It is located in absolute proximity to two beaches; Avalon with the ocean beach, its shops and good restaurants is in walking distance. 

To sum it up: highly recommended, we would visit again anytime."
2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Heema,"Good host who was easy to communicate with :) place was nice and clean with all necessary amenities. Location was as stated, located 10mins walk from Newtown station which is super handy and close to all the shops, food and bar. Overall, lovely, 10/10!"

2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,22124796,Simon,"We spent a very enjoyable six nights at this property, it is in great location within walking distance of the Rocks,Barangaroo and Cockle bay which has many lively bars and restaurants. The apartment building is modern and very safe with a 24/7 concierge. You should be aware that there is major development in this area for the next few years and that it can be noisy with construction work during the day, this was not a major issue for us. The apartment is well furnished and is as it appears in the photos it is up to the standard of a good four star hotel. We found the check in to be a little irksome and the apartment a little lacking in what we would consider to be expectations in a top end property such as additional towels and sufficient toilet rolls for a weeks stay. We also felt there should be a house handbook which is particularly important for overseas visitors not familiar with how the air con and appliances worked as well as providing emergency numbers and location of the local hospital.Whilst none of this spoilt our stay we have passed our comments onto the owners who’ve responded positively."
2016-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,1321603,Celine,"Ann was the perfect host.  From the welcome smile, to the beautiful breakfast and the awesome surroundings, we were not disappointed.  Dangar island is beautiful and the weekend was made even more special by how well Ann looked after us.  Everything was as described and this place is full of history.  Definitely worth a visit "
2017-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,8106459,Mary,"Brenda has a beautiful home. It is a perfect place for a quiet, relaxing stay close to all the Too spots in the area. We were visiting our Mum in hospital and we couldn't have found a better place. Brenda is a wonderful and welcoming host and I highly recommend her place to anyone.

2017-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,16020247,Andres,"Great location, well set up, helpful hostess. Very comfortable beds, even the couches. You do have to feed the cat but that's known at the start and no imposition. The stairs are most steep so beware if that's an issue. We would stay again."
2017-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Ariella,"An incredible stay at this warm, cottage with excellent facilities! I recommend Belinda's hospitality highly. She provided us with comprehensive information of the local region. The decor of the space was very comfortable; a wonderful get-away!"

2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,21939239,Francesco,"Don's flat is spacious and cozy and it has everything you need to enjoy a great stay, including a nice little garden and a fully equipped kitchen.

The flat is very quite but it's just around the  corner from so many superb cafes and restaurants. The area, Surry Hills, is in my opinion the most vibrant and interesting in Sydney and Don's place is right in its heart.

Don is a fantastic host and a very nice person: communication was great from the moment I booked to when I checked out and during my 9-day stay he constantly made sure I was enjoying my staying. And I certainly did: I hope I'll have the chance to travel again to Sydney and stay at Don's flat once more"
2015-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Matt,We had an excellent time staying in Maroubra. Marcella was extremely welcoming to our group and was more than happy to tell us about the area. We look forward to returning one year

"
2017-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Shannah,"Although based on a main road we were able to find parking easily and the traffic noise was not too distracting. We were able to create a cosy space with the heaters and fantastic bedding and appreciated the local menus left - highly recommend Zeus for souvlaki! The wooden floors next door meant the noise carried through however this wouldn't stop me staying here again. Fantastic check in process and such lovely, warm attentive hosts. "
2016-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Julian,"Loved this apartment in Avalon. Beautifully styled and finished with a cool, sophisticated beachy aesthetic and a lovely outlook into the garden.

2018-07-29T04:00:00.000Z,2838442,Jo,"Rhonda is a ""super host"" in every sense of the word. Welcoming, thoughtful, relaxed and has great taste in music & movies! I was able to cook myself a meal in her kitchen, even though Rhonda was in the midst of cooking for herself and her son ...... nothing was too much trouble. Then after we'd eaten, we settled in to her warm cosy loungeroom to watch a movie. There's a nice sunny outdoor table and chairs to eat breakfast at and the sparkling clean bathroom & toilet were easy to access from the unit, even in the middle of the night. A 5-star experience at a very reasonable rate!"
2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Ben,"What a find! Just minutes from Kingsford Smith makes this a great place to launch from if you have an early flight, or need a sleep after a late arrival.

Lots of cute restaurants,cafes in narrow streets nearby which make strolling very agreeable. Four big bedrooms make life easier for our group of 7.

Would definitely recommend this place to everyone ."
2017-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Rosemary,"Our stay was quite good. It was fairly close to the city which is what we needed, with cafes etc nearby. There were 4 of us so we could have a bedroom each.

La comunicación con el ha sido muy buena siempre y eso se agradece. La casa muy limpia y con todo lo necesario, incluso mas, como el aparato de música, la cama muy cómoda y la cocina aunque pequeña con bastantes utensilios.
La casa es igual que en las fotos, no decepciona en absoluto. Las vistas son increibles. Y esta en pleno centro de Manly y a dos pasos de su fantástica playa.
Ha ido una buena semana en Sydney!
La recomiendo totalmente!"

2016-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Melinda,"The view from the Beach House is a stunner - unspoilt panoramic views across the pittwater - it's truely unique and one of our favourites.  We had a wonderful family holiday our children loved the outdoor spaces and had loads of freedom within earshot of us. The house is well appointed and the kitchen has everything you need and more. Richard was a great host and easy to get in touch with. We stayed for 2 weeks and the weather overall was fantastic. We were thankful for this as the main house is small for two families (particularly when it's raining and you can't get outside). One small gripe was the main bathroom which is really in need of an update. The shower drain blocked a couple of times which we had to pump out. There were ants at night coming through the cracks in the wall. It was all pretty basic. The house is not cheap over the school holidays and at the rate we were paying we would have expected this to be in better condition. Overall we had a great stay. PS we thankfully didn't see the 1.5m goana roaming the property, just possums and wallabies!"
2016-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Jason,"This place is amazing! Simone is a great host, replying very quickly to my queries. The house is very welcoming, comfortable and perfectly located. Would love to stay here again!"
2015-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Mel,"Goodness. An air bnb host with both a great sense of style AND with relaxed insight into what makes for guests feeling really welcome and comfortable.  The linen was yummy to sleep in and the plethora of breakfast and snack offerings in the basket and fridge were also a great treat.  We could walk to more in the area than we even managed to do in the 3 days we were there (so there is no shortage of great food or entertainment). Even with an air mattress on the downstairs floor my friend and I felt we had plenty of room.  We'd stay there again in a flash. Next time we'll bring our nona trolleys, and cooler bags and shop up on goodies from the Greek deli and places on illawarra rd."

2016-06-19T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Ricardo,"We were very please with the apartment and its location. Unfortunately, we did not meet Nicole in person, but Donna was very kind to wait for us and give us the key. The unit is very well appointed and comfortable. Nice partial view of the Sydney skyline from the rooftop area. We were lucky to be in town for Vivid Sydney."
2018-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Craig,A great appartment with amazing views. Lots of restaurants within walking distance. I recommend this appartment if you are attending any functions in Olympic Park.

2019-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Richard,Amazing pool. So nice to go for a dip on a hot Sydney day. Sarah went above and beyond to get everything ready for my arrival.

2017-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,15312988,Asyurah,"Everything about my stay with Cindy and Claudio had been lovely. Their cozy apartment was the perfect place to go home to after a day spent out exploring Sydney. The room was so comfortable, their place was accessible to everywhere quite easily and I had a totally wonderful experience altogether. My brief encounter with them also showed how friendly they are. This place is definitely recommended and I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again if I'm back in Sydney. Cheers. :)"
2016-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,2711936,Matt,"Had a great week in Karen's lovely apartment. The room was clean, light and spacious. Karen's a great host and went out of her way to make sure I was happy. 
Great location few minutes walk to the beach, restaurants and cafe's and easy access to public transport. Would definitely recommend for anyone visiting Bondi! "
2017-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Ned,The proximity to the airport made our life real easy...
2018-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Anthony,All was good and came in very handy thank you
2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,27479560,Teigan,Erin’s Airbnb is exactly like the photos it’s clean and stylish and so easy to check in. Such a beautiful Airbnb if you’re looking for a home away from home this Airbnb is the one you’d want to book!
2018-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,19348489,Frank,Isabelle was extremely communicative throughout the entire stay. The location and space was great and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking at booking.
2018-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,22124796,Dani,"Tam was super accessible, we never felt like we were a hassle if we needed to ask a question. It's a lovely spot, surrounded by a part of Sydney we'd not explored yet. Very comfy bed, spacious bathroom, perfect for a cosy stay or a place to come home to in Sydney. We loved the balcony in particular. A great central home, hosted very well."
2018-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Michael,"Great place, good location, consideration given to the finer touches. Recommend!"
2017-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,13442098,Ariel,Convenient location to Olympic park activities and train station.  Great cafes and restaurants within walking distance.
2018-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,22124796,Aidan,Very nice apartment in a great location right by Barangaroo with a great balcony. Everything was spotless and the bathroom was one of the highlights. Would definitely recommend in the future!

2017-11-05T04:00:00.000Z,21530399,Lisa,"I really enjoyed the stay. Yasmin is very easy going, thoughtful and friendly. She prepared us some chocolate and wine as it was my boyfriends birthday.  
The house is amazin with grate design. Walking distance to bus to the city. Our room is very comfy with ensuite and aircon. Definitely recommend!"
2018-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,16166535,Cecilia,"Again, our stay with Fei was like wonderland. Its a dream-world. 
I hope to make it my second home in Sydney : )"

2016-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,10213499,Robert,Tracy and Rod were brilliant hosts and pre-trip and during my stay made sure I had everything I needed. The apartment was fantastic and had everything I needed. Wonderful location and completely private. Would stay there again!
2018-10-17T04:00:00.000Z,18620288,Oliver,Worth place to stay
2017-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,16549021,Jacqueline,"Location, location, location.  This place is an attached, two-story condo on the beach block. It's walking distance to the train into Sydney and downtown Cronulla. The neighborhood is safe and the ""take-away"" place across the street does great ""long black"" coffee.  

Robert, a great host, welcomed me, my husband and 3 small daughters warmly and we had a WONDERFUL time."
2018-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,26308209,Garrison,"This private & quiet retreat offered a pleasurable solace, but so well situated being a short walk to the beach, golf course & local cafes.
Gail & Kim were delightful hosts, & very accommodating. 
Highly recommended!"
2018-06-13T04:00:00.000Z,19376053,Binary,the apartment is near the train station. Convenient and clean. everything we needed are all provided.
2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,19508741,Luisa,"Great space in the perfect location. The space is lovely and big, with separate tv room, big bedroom and a lovely patio with fountain. There is onsite parking and the location is only 4 mins walk to the stylish Newport hotel and 15 mins walk to shops and cafes and the beach. 
Great location and Tessa and Rod were very friendly! Will def come back!"
2018-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,16408272,Stuart,"Chloe was slow to respond, and didn't respond to messages sometimes. Otherwise a great stay! Great location."
2018-03-12T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Timo & Jessica,"We would not recommend staying here at all. For just $10 more you could stay at the Marriott across the road and enjoy a clean room. The apartment was not properly cleaned: gaps between cabinets and white appliances showed piles of dust and dirt; tiles missing on shower exposed mold; stains were all over the walls and there was an intense chemical smell throughout the apartment. The location was perfect, but it seemed obvious the host was cutting corners to produce a profit. We love staying with Airbnb all around the world, but the lack of care and attention to detail in this unit is unacceptable."
2018-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,18315277,Marco,"For sure the biggest value added of this house is the location, just 5 minutes from Bondi Beach. Another plus is the bus stop just right in the corner that bring you to Bondi Junction where you can get the tube. The check in isn’t the easiest one whereas there are instruction (mostly if done in late evening). The flat is perfect up to 2 persons and is quite clean, even if something more could be done. At the end, considering the general picture, I’d suggest this accommodation to another guest."
2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,20962081,Kisung,Just perfect!  Facilities were all well working and location was great. You can walk to many tourist spot.
2017-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Gurvan,"Contact et entrée facile, très proche de l'aéroport, quartier calme et appartement propre

2019-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,4502957,Ashlyn,The house is in a great location for access to Bondi Beach.  It is on a quiet street and away from the noise of Bondi.  The house would be suitable for families.
2018-07-29T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Diane,"Perfect location!  Couldn’t have been easier to see the sites. The apartment had nice amenities and was comfortably cozy. Chloe was easily accessible and responsive. 

Do Consider adding an extra day for luggage storage. Arriving from Dallas on a 6 am flight doesn’t provide many options. We ended up storing luggage at smarte carte in the Rocks which worked out ok.  

We will be back again!

"
2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Paola And Arie,"Evelyn's place was the perfect spot for our relaxed weekend away by the water.
The views was stunning and we loved the sauna and the pool too.
Nice interior design and great location. We easily walked to Avalon as well as the nearby Paradise beach.
Thanks Evelyn for having us! "
2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,John,"We are also Air B&B hosts with lots of our own travels to compare.
Angela & her accommodation offer are commendable.
Great location with easy commute from Sydney Airport, very short walk to beach & photos are an honest reflection of her space.
Angela has been more that helpful & is very good as a host.
I’d come back here without hesitation. Thanks Angela"
2018-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,5581269,Clinton & Bianca,A beautiful location and Michy and Paul were kind hosts. The only issue was the lawnmower man coming through the backyard at 9am. There for some peace and a sleep in but our luck brought the mower man too. Great place though.
2017-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Eva,"We stayed at Paul’s place for 3 nights. The location is great, a 20-minute walk from the opera, surrounded by shops and restaurants. The flat was clean and very pleasant to stay in. I would totally highly recommend it for a stay in Sydney !"
2015-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Stewart,"Diana welcomed us at the apartment, showed us how to enter and leave the complex. Garage underneath and shops also under the apartments easily accessible. Apartment was as described. We were entirely satisfied and would return .Apartment itself very clean with all facilities you would require."
2018-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Kezza,This could was ok could be better looked after and maintain better
2016-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Helen,Cath was incredibly accommodating and her place is perfect for a getaway for two! Cath's little flat is modern and clean and sleek with a fun loft bed that helped you feel hidden away from the world. The area is great if you want to be a little ways from the busyness of the city but not too far to travel either. Cath provided us with fresh bread and croissants for breakfast which was just the cherry on top of a wonderful stay. Cath is a friendly host who will assist you with anything you need. If you're looking for a calm stay outside the city then this is the place for you! Would definitely stay their again. Thanks Cath!
2015-07-06T04:00:00.000Z,1131054,Robyn,"I can not speak highly enough of Louise's apartment. If you are after the quintessential eastern suburbs stay and experience- this is it. Fabulous, roomy apartment in great location. Louise went out of her way to accomodate us at last minute and made us feel very welcome. Loved it. Robyn"
2015-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,5224098,Daysee,"My partner and I was happy staying at Tam's beautiful apartment in Darlinghurst. Tam's description of the space is accurate, and the apartment is, if anything, more beautiful than the photos might suggest. The house was immaculately cleaned and maintained, well equipped in a lovely neighborhood. The location is amazing; Hyde Park is literally 1 min walk from the apt, close to good restaurants, coffee shops, and convenient store. The setting is perfect for a weekend or holiday getaway. Perfect for tourists or when you're on a business trip. 

I didn't get to meet Tam as he was away for holiday. But things were easy! Tam was a terrific host; he responded promptly to my initial query, and once we were there, it seemed that he'd thought of everything. Highly recommended!"
2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Natalie,"Our stay at Paul’s place was really great. The location is great to spend time in Darlinghurst or near Circular Quay, and still amazing if you don’t mind a bit of a walk to Darling Harbour and Barangaroo. His book of local recommendations was a life saver, and he was great with communication overall. The place is basic but stylish and contains everything you need."
2016-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Jeff,Cathy is a wonderful host
2017-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,18620288,Ilias,"I would happily live in this apartment as it is. The view is spectacular and the apartment is very comfortable with a very well equiped kitchen good internet and all the comforts of home including a nice bed. I love this location, close to the train and direct access to the city but in a lovely neighbourhood again with unbeatable views of the harbour. Everything is good quality and the inclusions well thought out to make things easy for your stay. I have rented Airbnb properties all over the world, this is one of the first ones that I sent links to my friends. You won't be disappointed."

2017-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,5469086,Nadia,"Anitta's place was in a fab location just a short walk from the beach. It was a great base for us as we explored Sydney and the Eastern suburbs. It was a bit cold, because it was winter, but Anitta told us where to find extra blankets and provided a heater. And although she was overseas was really quick to respond to any queries we had. We had a really lovely time."
2017-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,22335017,Wolfgang,"to get to your room or to the kitchen you have to go through the room where the host is sleeping .you have to share the same toilet with him.
the location is very central and for that usually possibly very silent (during my booking unfortunately there was construction work next door going on).
the house  has also a very nice roofgarden (in case you are smoker)"
2016-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,652063,云红,"Hernan is very friendly,you will feel comfortable staying (Website hidden by Airbnb) close to the airport,5 mins walk to the beach,but a little noise."

2017-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Michel,"Appartement charmant, calme et bien équipé. Les instructions de Linda ainsi que les informations et documentations sur le quartier, les moyens de transport, les endroits à  visiter etc parfaitement claires et utiles. Situation idéale pour visiter Sydney, tout près de la station de train/metro Redfern, ou même à pied à 15 mn de la gare centrale. ...Séjour parfait. J'y reviendrais sans hésitation. Thank you Linda."
2016-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,1950395,Jo,"This is a fantastic family home in a beautiful part of Sydney. Great views, excellent outdoor decks and the perfect size pool.  Beds were very comfortable and the linen was of a good quality.  Plenty of a space for a family or in our case multi generational family.  
Great coffee shop and local shops nearby although I would suggest you need a car to access restaurants and major shops.
Kitchen is well stocked with everything you need.
Very comfortable family home."
2017-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Gwenaelle,"Un petit coin sympa, avec des balades au bord de mer toute proche, la vue de la maison est superbe, la chambre à tous se qu'il faut."
2016-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Kirsi,"The Garden Studio is lovely and Cath friendly and very helpful. We really enjoyed our stay with a yummy breakfast of cereal or fresh eggs (from the three beautiful chickens) and plenty of things to do. The apartment is perfect, short walk to the train or bus, and close to shops and restaurants. Highly recommended! Thanks Cath for a great stay!"
2017-04-21T04:00:00.000Z,15060713,Matt,Location is great and the pool and tennis court are a bonus.  The apartment was quiet and the host easy to communicate with.  I would happily recommend this apartment for anyone wanting to explore Sydney.

2018-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Susan,"We booked on short notice, we found Wendy's accommodation excellent.  Responses were prompt and helpful. We were flying to Canada because of a sick grandchild, the hassle free night at Wendy's was a good start to a long journey."

2015-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Rafael,"Belinda is SUPER! She's kind, lovely and, for sure, a SUPER HOST. She did everything for us to feel at home. The studio is super clean, the bed is soft and the trees around made us feel comfortable and in peace.

There are some stairs in the backyard in your way to the house, so consider that if you are bringing many bags to carry.

We spent 3 days with her and had a great time in Bundenna. The beaches are THE BEST! If you like flat beaches, you will love it. Ask for the Ferry beach and Wattamolla. Super!

Well, super guest Belinda, amazing place to stay.. We strongly recomend it :) Thanks, thanks, thanks!"
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,15312988,Yong Zhi,"Nice location, close to UNSW and Coogee beach. Cindy and Claudio were very hospitable. The place was very clean. I would not hesitate to stay with them again."
2018-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Joe,"Location was good if you were attending a concert at Sydney Olympic Park/Qudos Bank Arena, as is only a $12 taxi ride away. It was a 22 degrees winters day in Sydney, however when entering the apartment it was stifling hot, even with all windows open. We closed all windows and blinds and put the air con on and it took forever to cool down the apartment as it has floor to ceiling length windows. I would hate to imagine what it would be like on a 35+ degrees day in Sydney's summer. The bed was rock hard and the pillows offered no support, so I would suggest bringing your own pillow. The total cost was $186.56 AUD for a one night stay on a Monday night, when booking more than five months in advance. $65 of this was a cleaning fee, which I find excessive as to have the bins emptied, sheets changed and a quick vacuum would not take very long. There were a couple of convenience stores nearby. We walked over the foot bridge to find somewhere for lunch but both places were closed, so other than one small cafe nearby there was nowhere within walking distance to eat out."
2015-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Laura,"I had such a great stay with Duncan and Ashley.  Their little apartment was very inviting and had everything I needed. It was clean and tidy and nicely presented with bunches of flowers which were replaced/refreshed during my stay. More little touches such as the brand new white fluffy towels rolled on the end of my bed and topped with Lindt Chocolates made this stay a really pleasant experience. 
And as for Duncan and Ashley.....these are two super friendly, interesting and generous people. I had a great chat with Duncan when I arrived and he invited me to come on his boat... and then chatting to Ashley on the last night she offered to come along with me to a gallery the following day.  These two go out of their way to include you in Sydney.  I could not recommend this AirBnB enough."
2017-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,Claire,"A lovely room! Had a great stay at Kath's, she provided plenty of advice about Sydney, the dog was a gigantic cutie, and the balcony made the place an absolute stand out :)"

2017-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,16827551,David,"Brilliant 2 bedroom place perfect for a short stay in Balmain. The house is close to Darling street shops and there is a bus stop about 5 mins walk that goes directly into CBD. Theres also a ferry stop which is about 10mins walk and we used that once for an alternative route into town. Theres a pleasant park down the road with fantastic views onto harbour bridge from Birchgrove.

The house itself is high spec with everything we needed and we loved using the courtyard for breakfast. 
Host was excellent and they installed an air con in the living room which worked out really well given the hot summer in Sydney at the time. 

Couldn't fault the place- highly recommended."
2018-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Trang,"Thank you for a such a nice place. It is central and close to many things. We can walk to the museum, parks and shops.
We love the wide window with a lot of sunlight.
You are a very good host, David.
Your communication is great. Thank you for letting us check in early and check out late."
2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,6785160,Courtney,"Carole's home was lovely! Everything was as described, and she was very responsive by phone to answer questions. Her partner Steve was home during most of our stay and readily available to answer any questions as well while Carole was working. Their dog Buddy is the cutest. The location is near a really cool part of town called Newtown. Highly recommend checking it out!"

2019-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,18047246,Sneha,Good place. Easy access to shops.
2017-12-12T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Lena,"We loved our time in Bryan’s accommodation! 
The cottage is very cozy, comfortable and perfectly located - close to the center and a just 3 minutes walk to the park. The park is perfect for jogging, skating, walks and provides an incredible view of the Anzac and Harbour Bridge! If you want to have another amazing view, you just need to go the cottage’s balcony and enjoy the sundown with a glass of good wine. 

We had an amazing time while we visited Sydney. If you search for a cozy home, close to the city, but a in quiet neighbourhood, the Glebe and Bryan’s cottage is perfect for you!!"
2018-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Edith,"The appartment is very easy to reach by train or bus. It is not big but big enough (and cute) as you will be out most of the time to explore Sydney. Millie is very accurate with response, tries to help the best she can with all kind of tips. The elevator in the appartment building was most convenient with our heavy suitcases..... :). Thanks again Millie."
2018-05-16T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Melinda,"The convenience of this apartment is fantastic, a short walk to the ferry, buses and trains which all lead to the City, the Stadium, Cafes and more. The hosts are wonderful and the apartment is well maintained."
2017-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Monica,"Great location right on the beach. Champagne and chocolates on arrival a surprising touch. Fantastic sharp knives in the well equiped kitchen with a Nespresso and a good supply of pods to keep us caffeinated!
Parking on the street only an issue during the day in the busy summer holiday period but ample spots after hours."
2018-08-09T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,John,Leslie and Eric's place is very nice and in a great location. We found buses and ferry's a plenty and really loved the apartment and all it's conveniences. Thanks To Leslie and Eric for a great stay..
2017-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,21063718,Kel,"Very modern, one year old, two story house. Tota and family are great hosts always attentive and helpful to our needs. Room with private bathroom was fantastic. Very neat clean, tidy and very spacious with lots of room and great open planning. Recommended as a very good airbnb house and hosts."
2018-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,19508741,Bronia,Tessa are wonderful hosts who care a great deal about their guests comfort and have all the  personal touches to make you feel at home. Even delicious homemade muffins and marmalade. It is central but very quiet. I hope to return.
2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Murray,"An excellent place to stay, especially if you are driving. Very new, well thought out private unit with all mod cons. Small but great for one or two. I would definitely stay there again."
2016-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Marty,"We arrive late (after 8pm)  Philip was there to meet us and go over the home.  You talk about Location it was the best location, walking to everything was right.  The home was clean and ready for us.  If we needed anything or questions Philip was just a phone call away and willing to help.  Thanks Philip if we come back to Sydney I would love to stay at your place again."
2018-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,24916551,Harris,it's a nice and tidy place around 7 minutes from the station which is not bad. good value for money.
2014-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Rebecca,Richard is quick and helpful when responding to my numerous questions. The place was even more beautiful than i had imagined and there was beyond the necessary supplied for us.

2018-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Mark,"This property is in a stunning location with easy access to the city (albeit by Ferry 1 hr or train 10min walk and 25 min train). Free car parking, awesome cooking facilities and an amazing IGA supermarket within 2 minute walk. The setup for families was good (room for parents, roll out for kids). Communication from Yang was great. Thank you "

2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,18338274,Jane,"This is a beautiful, well-equipped and comfortable home full of eclectic decor and in a great location, close to transport, cafes, restaurants, interesting shops and markets. The stairs to the top bedroom are steep and the only bathroom is on the ground floor, so not suitable for anyone with disabilities or young children, but perfect for those who appreciate beauty and art and good living and prefer to be in an area that is lively and hip during the day but quiet at night. The sunny courtyard is a bonus, as are the friendly neighbours."
2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,20374683,Angie On Sin,Phan is such a great host who is very friendly and helpful. Her place is clean and everything is handy. The location is very convenient which is just next to the central station. Highly recommend this place for families and friends!

2018-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Tessa,That this was my third stay at this lovely place should tell you everything you need to know! It is a delightful getaway in a beautiful location. Can't recommend highly enough even if it means booking my fourth stay will probably be harder!
2018-09-13T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Anthony,Nice clean place. Major problem was no towells which Wendy was not able to rectify. To her credit she did everything in her power to make up for it.

Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Sydney. 
A tip! Visit Spice Alley for food. Only a few minutes walk."
2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Seb,"This place was amazing, deceptively large floor plan, two balcony (city view, harbor view) just fantastic! Would look to book here again when next in Sydney."
2018-04-20T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,James,"Really cool place in a great part of town. The space is ideal for small groups. Really comfy sofas and beds. You are also in a cool part of town v close to the northern working district, and also to nature - go for a morning jog along the coast!! Also recommend the great little deli on Union St just a stone's through away. Sydney living at its best!"
2016-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Antonio,"David's place is a gem in the whole city of Sydney. It's close to public transit, the place had a charm few other places have. Its placement, so close to the parklet of Potts Point, really make you feel like you're a world away. The stay was great thanks to David's little personal touches."
2014-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Lise,"I arrived at Kerri's place, and thought, Hmmm...when can I move in? This is a fabulous apartment, and Kerri is a generous, thoughtful host who contributed a great deal to making my stay in Sydney very enjoyable indeed. Plus, we had a lot in common, which made for some lovely conversations! I would heartily recommend this place to travelers seeking a fine welcome in a beautiful apartment. Only word of note: if you're someone who needs absolute quiet, it's a bit noisy on weekday mornings (not weekends, which are much quieter).   "
2016-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Ibrahim,"Thanks Angela, I will come again and again "
2018-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,22295401,Izabella,"Griffin is a great host; friendly, flexible and kind. We were confronted with bad weather conditions in Sydney (our flight was cancelled) and he gracefully let us stay longer to accomodate alternative travel. Also Griffin answered  quickly and accurately to all our questions. 

The appartment is near Kings Cross Station and is easy to get to by tube from the airport and city center. You can walk from the city center, it is not far but you have to like climbing like I do! 

The building is an oldie but goodie. It is functional, nice and light. 
The appartment is on the 5th floor so I was greatful that Griffin could get my suitcase upstairs. I would never have been able to do it on my own.

The place consists of 3 spaces: a bedroom with a confy bed, table and a closet,  a bathroom with a bathtub and connecting this a small kitchen where  you can cook.
Griffin left for us water and some stuff in the kitchen which was very kind and handy for the first day.

There are 2 big supermarkets 2 minutes away.

There is an baggage airbnb nearby if you need to store your luggage. Very easy and good."

2014-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Rita,"I stayed at Louise apartment for 2 weeks cause it is close to UNSW. It is convenient to visit my son who studies there.

2017-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Sebastian,"Cath appartment is a wonderful place to stay when visiting Sydney.  The garden appartment is in a quite neighborhood but offers everything in close vincinity (shops, grocery stores, restaurants) and with the 2 Opal cards Cath provides you are perfectly equipped to use busses and trains to explore Sydney. 
I really enjoyed my stay and was treated like a king. "
2017-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,13689460,Laura,Great location! Easy to get to from central station and plenty of buses around the corner too. Bed was really comfy. Hosts were super friendly and flexible with our checkout - Thanks guys it was great.

You live in a beautiful area with great access to the lake, the surf, public transport and all the wonderful facilities of Narrabeen.  The apartment is neat, clean and well appointed . We especially enjoyed eating our breakfast on the balcony while enjoying views of the lake and the beautiful tropical garden.  A great stay, thank you"

2013-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Rod,"I visit Sydney for work a few times a year and previously have stayed in motels. It is extremely difficult and expensive to find anything close to the city. So I thought I'd give airbnb a try and Kerri's place looked and sounded great. 

I was really pleased to have found Kerri's lovely apartment. Very comfortable and well designed and Kerri is the perfect host: even cooked me a lovely meal when I arrived and provided secure parking for my car. Kerri is very friendly and easy-going and you quickly feel like you're staying at an old friends house.

Thanks Kerri. I'm sure I'll be looking to stay again on future trips to Sydney

2017-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Michael,Loverly place. Very quite inside even though in busy area of Newtown. Great help with checkin and out
2017-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Ailee,"We had a lovely weekend at Susan's studio. Great location for exploring Bondi, Bronte, Clovelly and Coogee. Very clean, warm and comfortable and looks exactly as pictured. "
2015-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Man Ling,Linda is really kind. She checked in on us on the day when we arrive and her apartment is 5 mins of walking to Redfern station and about 10 mins to Central station. Could not have ask for more and I really love the quietness of the apartment within the residential area.
2013-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Wei Kin,"It was a great experience staying there! Like what Gavin has said, it was really a few mins walk from central station. If you need to have air con in your room, then this will not be the place for you. And yes, the toilet door has been fixed! Do note that it will be a shared toilet with the host. Satisfied with my stay, if you're looking at a place just to wash up and sleep while on holiday in Sydney, this is the place for you."
2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Giordana,Very quick responses and great communication. Nice residential quiet area with cafes and restaurants within walking distance.

We had a great stay at Susan's place. The cottage is as good as the pictures. Susan is a great host and help us with lots of informations before and during our stay. We highly recommend her place. Many thanks Susan.We loved Sydney and had a nice weekend in Australia. The place is very central and very close to the city centre. Buses was easy to catch even on Sunday and public holiday. We will definitely love to stay again at Susans in the future :-)

Nous sommes accueilli avec, dans le frigo, jus d'orange, bière et bouteille d'eau! Bryan est tres disponible. Il répond toujours présent à chaque demande. L'arrêt de bus est à 5 minutes à pieds. Ensuite il faut compter 25 minutes pour atteindre le centre.
Pour finir, merci à Bryan pour ce séjour!!!"
2017-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,16549021,Sarah,Good location. Value for money if you're staying for at least 2 nights.
2017-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,21421463,Tristan,"I really enjoyed this unit. It was probably the most functional space anyone could have created for a studio. It has everything you need and more. A workplace, living area, kitchen, washer/dryer, balcony, nice bathroom, and plenty of storage space throughout. The only downside is the unit is not equipped with AC. Fortunately they provided two fans which were very helpful and needed. Everything else was perfect and the host did an excellent job communicating and assuring I had a great stay. The location of the unit is within the Darling Harbour area and only a ten-fifteen minute walk from the Central business district. Near a park and many businesses and restaurants. Would recommend it to a couple or single person."
2015-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Tbird,"The studio was perfect for me! I needed a quiet, private space to get my work done. Susan was extremely welcoming and also left me alone which I appreciated. The space was sparkling clean and the bed was fab with snuggly sheets! Thanks Susan"

Steve and Fiona where helpful and accommodating with you feeling obliged to continuously chat.
They left us to the upstairs area with privacy yet with the added benefit of being able to reach out downstairs to them when needed"

The apartment is 5 mins walking distance from the bus that takes you in the city. Everything was clean and tidy, communication was excellent, happy to recommend it to anyone :)"
2014-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Madeline,"I stayed at Naveen's place for three nights in December, one for work and two for pleasure and it was great! Excellent location, lovely host who was extremely helpful and welcoming. I wanted to stay away from a hotel and have a less solitary experience and I couldn't have asked for a better place. The room is a little noisy on a weekend night which is to be expected for the area and I didn't realise there was air con which probably made it a little worse with the windows open. Otherwise it was perfect, clean, well maintained, stylish and with a personal bathroom. I look forward to returning! "
2019-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,20374683,洁,"Phan 非常的nice,带着她的小狗狗迎接我们入住｡房子交通非常便利,走到中央车站南广场只要三分钟｡去任何地方都很方便｡厨房设施比较齐全,唯一不足的是我们一行九个人,入住还是有点挤,五六个人比较合适｡在市中心算是性价比比较高的地方｡"
2016-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Harriet,"The flat was very modern and we'll equipped, I only stayed for one night but it was a pleasant experience. Only downside was the bathroom wasn't that clean, maybe due to sharing with another airbnb guest, because the room was spotless. Thanks for having me to stay!"

2014-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Graham,"Kerri's was a lovely place to stay and she was both friendly and helpful too. It was only a short 15 minute train ride to the centre of Sydney so with a my multipass it was easy.

Listen to kerri's hints and tips as Watson's bay was truly fabulous."
2016-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,April,"We loved our stay at North Avalon Beach Apartments. Hosts Angela & Jeff were both very friendly, welcoming & helpful during our stay picking us up from the ferry & offering to drive us anywhere during our stay. Although they are living up stairs the downstairs apartment is extremely private, quiet & separate to up stairs. It feels as if there is no one else around. This neighbour hood is filled with many other beautiful beach houses and feels very safe and welcoming. We will definitely be back to stay at the North Avalon Beach apartments again. Thank you! "
2017-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Eric,"A lovely, spacious, and neat home with all the accommodations a family of four would want, one half block from the bus line going right into Sydney CBD and Central Station. The host was communicative and helped us make arrangements as needed during our stay. We highly recommend this rental unit."
2016-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,Anna Lorraine,"This room was lovely! I bring my cup of coffee to the balcony every morning and do a bit of light reading because the balcony is just perfect for that.
Kath was generous with amenities, a lot of pillows, a lot of towels, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, all at our disposal. Coffee, milk, tea and bread on the house.
Fan is available too. Initially wanted to let the cool air in, but cars keep passing by so best to get that glass door shut to keep the noise out.
If the two rooms are rented, bathroom time can be tricky in the morning so best to get up early, i guess. (Ask whether the other room will be rented on your dates!)
Location is very ideal, a few steps away from Redfern station, one stop away from Central and easily accessible to everywhere. Did not get to try the bus from here, as trains got us everywhere anyway.
Uber to airport was $29."
2016-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Suzanne,"Susan's cottage was everything I had imagined from the photos. She was welcoming and accommodating - I needed to work from the studio so she set up a desk for me. She is easy going and incredibly interesting. 

An added bonus was the wonderful atmosphere she created -  the other guests, Susan and I had a wonderful meal together and shared stories. 

I definitely will be returning. Thanks Susan."

2015-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Anna,"I had a lovely 4 weeks in Natasa's place. She's super helpful and knowledgeable about the area and shows you everything you need. She even took me to the shops on day one!  The house is fabulously close to the station.. about 2 minutes and well looked after. The room was bright, spacious and exactly what I was after.  The kitchen is tidy and super well equipped. Even though we had a full house at times, I never had any issues getting access to the bathroom or washing machines. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with Natasa and can only highly recommend her place if you are looking for that balance between having your independence ( I was working so many night were spend on marking..) and socialising; we had some pleasant evenings catching up with all house mates and a beautiful glass of wine! Thanks Natasa for making me feel so welcome and being such a great host... I'll be back that's for sure!"

2019-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,24460520,Kim,"Julia's place was really nice, well set out, light and was really comfortable. Special touches around. Would have been even better with aircon, however we survived with the fans :)"
2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,17028088,Di,"I stayed in Kathy’s place for three weeks and the overall experience was wonderful. Kathy is super friendly and thoughtful. She always responds to questions and needs timely, but you also have enough privacy as you have your own entrance. The place has all the basic kitchen stuff, so it’s ideal for people who’d like to cook themselves. The location is unbeatable as well. I would definitely recommend this place. "
2017-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,19574869,Kerri,"The apartment was in such a fantastic location! Easy to join the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk and what an amazing walk it is! 
Loved sitting out on the 'generous' balcony and enjoying the view down to Tamarama Beach SLSC. 
Thank you so much Ruby for this little 'oasis' in a beautiful part of the world!

2016-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Charles,"Good location to take train at Redfern Station, nice host to clearly deliver message and guidance. Two rooms are set for Airbnb which means we will share bathroom with the other guests. Both are polite. In all, it is convenient and comfortable stay."

2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,24916551,Mick,"A fantastic experience - a beautiful home with amazing hosts. Our little family loved the place and we were able to access public transport, playing spaces and public facilities such as cafes and supermarkets very easily. Alice and Richard ensured our stay was comfortable and enjoyable and were very easy to communicate with. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,7439246,Jessica,"Nathan’s place is stunning; the perfect beachside getaway for a couple or young family to enjoy long-term or for a long weekend. We loved our stay and after two months we were very sad to leave what felt like home. Nathan and his wife and kids are simply lovely, kind people who didn’t hesitate to help us with any issues or queries. I’m still blown away that after messaging Nathan with news that the dryer had broken, he replied right away and we had a replacement THE NEXT DAY. Our baby son loved all the little hiding spots around the house. We were impressed with the style of the place, plus the HUGE amount of storage available. But our favourite part? The ocean is so close you can hear it from anywhere in the house. Thank you for a truly wonderful and memorable stay!"
2017-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,16898275,David,"This 2 bedroom apartment is in a great location, handy to shops, cafes, ferry, etc. Clean & tidy with large screen TV. Good value & we would stay here again!"

Very short walk to ferry, the beach, restaurants & bars yet surprisingly quiet. Fitted with nice, modern furnishings & conveniences, this was perfect for our 5-day stay. Ziggy was a great host with fantastic, prompt communication. Thank you for hosting us!"

2014-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Wenyin,We enjoyed our stay at Gavin's place! He's a nice host who recommended some nice beaches and helped to plan our days in the lovely city of Sydney. This apartment is super clean and has nicely aired room. Will come back if we get the chance to revisit this wonderful country!

2017-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Gosia,the apartment is perfectly located. It is located within walking distance of the city center. public transport is also very close to the apartment. everything that was needed was a in the equipment flat. everything was very well organized. I would heartily recommend!
2015-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Tracey,"This was our first time using Air BnB and we couldn't have wished for a better experience.   The apartment was all that was promised, small but beautifully appointed and there was plenty of room for the three of us.  The location was fabulous, we just walked out the door and hopped on a bus to the city or Chinatown.  The train was only a short stroll away.  We had no trouble getting around.  Not that you needed to go far.....there were plenty of delicious places to eat and wonderful farmer's markets directly opposite on Saturday morning.   The best treat was lying in the very comfortable bed, snuggled under the feather doona and just melting with the aromas of freshly baking bread wafting up from the French patisserie below....heaven.  Paul was a most gracious host...friendly, informative and everything was super organised.  We had a fabulous time and will most definitely stay again. Thanks, Paul!"
2018-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,15889399,Debbie,A lovely clean and comfortable cabin in a safe and convenient location.

2016-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Hendrik,"We enjoyed the time in the apartment very much. David's communication was always promptly and detailed. He gave us a warm welcome and already awaited us upon our arrival. The apartment itself was exactly as described. Only the noises from the adjacent apartment surprised us. The connection to public transport with Kings Cross Station is perfect. Within 30 minutes you can get to Bondi Beach, Airport or any other well known place in central Sydney. This is the perfect location for a couple to stay in Sydney."

2013-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,794910,Natalie,"This was my first time using AirBnB and it was really easy.  Gavin was a great host - very prompt response to the initial booking, clear and easy instructions to get to the apartment.  He was also friendly and helpful with recommendations for restaurants, activities, and even some interesting books!  The location was great - really handy to the train station for coming in from the airport, and close to the CBD, Paddington and Surry Hills for shopping.  The room was simple but spacious and nice and clean.  Highly recommended."
2016-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Lachlan,Great cabin! Parents really enjoyed it. It was very convenient and michy was very accommodating to our needs. Cheers!

2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,12370710,Andrew,Maria and Jerry are incredible hosts - super kind and helpful.  And the view from the clean simple beachy room is one of the best in the world! (if you love oceans and beaches and things that are amazing)
2018-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,21612973,Joey,"Jackie has created a beautiful space in this airy and spacious apartment. The room was perfectly clean, with an extremely comfortable bed, and a great view over Manly at sunrise. Jackie is a very accommodating host and I’d recommend this place to anyone travelling to Manly."
2016-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,11396243,Rachael,The host canceled this reservation 186 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2017-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Richard,"Linda is a great host and provided assistance to me on arrival and to her guests departing, to accomodate everyone s preferences. The property is very cool. Dont want to tell everyone incase its busy when I need it.. shhhh"
2018-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,26334724,Emma,"We stayed here for a few nights with our 3 month old and the in-laws. 

We had everything we needed for our stay and the location is brilliant. Redfern station is such a short walk and the location made it easy to navigate around Sydney with a young baby. 

The hosts communicated well and quickly before and during our stay and allowed a late check out which was great as the weather took a bad turn and we had a later flight booked.

I would recommend staying here."
2017-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,15920870,Joanna,Really good staying in Oliver's apartment. Nice view and quiet. Close to public transportation. Would love to stay next time!

The yummy fresh breakfast was an added bonus, not to mention the chocolate. Susan and Greg are lovely hosts and were there to help with any questions. The location is fantastic, we love bronte. "
2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,8559496,Marianna,"Living with Tiger was a great experience!
Alltough we booked just one day before,Tiger prepared everything and made us feel very welcome everytime! (He also took pictures from the complex,the street,his flat to explain how we can find everything and to make sure,that we can't get lost- so cute :D )
His flat is so lovely and very clean.
Tiger had to work during our stay,but he offered help anytime. Thank you again! :)
We had space and much time on our own,he really cared about us.
Thank you for everything Tiger! 
Hopefully we can return some day,because we couldn't say goodbye :(
All the best for you!
Marianna&Fabiola"
2017-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Cameron,"Wayne and Kate's apartment is a fantastic place to stay, in so many ways. 
The location is second to none...right across from the beach, good coffee nearby and bondi beach is a short stroll away. Parking looks like it might be tricky, but we never had a problem. There is one flight of stairs to walk up, but even my bad knees coped and it's worth it for the view anyway!
The apartment itself is gorgeous. Beautiful views, comfy beds, a well appointed 'library',  a selection of toiletries, lovely lamps, vibrant art and everything easy to find and operate thanks to a small information leaflet, or even a quick phone call...Wayne and Kate were both readily contactable and quick to help when we got a bit stuck at check-in!
The apartment is very clean...and I'm pretty fussy when it comes to accommodation cleanliness. The linen is fresh, there are towels aplenty, blankets, pillows, complete kitchen...everything you need to be comfortable. 
I would highly recommend this apartment for up to 6 (Website hidden by Airbnb) a gem. "
2014-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Jay,"The place was great, better than describes. Very impressive place and will definitely look at going back. Ace!"
2017-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Jessica,"Easy to find, great location, easy parking and a lovely clean, fresh and tidy place to stay. The bathroom was spotless!!"
2014-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Zen,"Thank you, Richard, for a wonderful house and experience on a lovely beach. The house is right on the beach. It is charming and thoughtfully decorated. The lizards/goannas can be a bit alarming but it's all part of the experience. The kitchen and linen cupboards are well supplied. And the fishing is excellent :)"
2018-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Charlotte,"Cath was the perfect host! She provided everything we needed from universal adapters to fresh eggs from her chickens. Cath even provides a binder full of information about the area (nearby hospitals, cute coffee places, things to do). The Garden Studio itself is very cute and stylish. My boyfriend and I stayed here for several weeks, and it had everything we needed. We couldn’t have asked for a better host or a better space for our stay in Sydney."
2018-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,20962081,Jorja,Lovely apartment that was clean and tidy. Min was very quick to answer questions. Overall a very pleasant experience.
2017-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Amelia,"Everything it promises and more. The views are incredible, the apartment is immaculate. So walkable - 10 minutes from everywhere (25 to Mrs Macs chair), depending how fast you walk, obviously.
Pamela & Hugo have presented a lovely apartment, with perfectly sized furniture to make it comfortable without being crowded. The full kitchen was amazing to have access to as someone with dietary restrictions. Being 2 blocks from a full supermarket made life so easy.
Our only almost-negative was the neighbour playing super loud music when we got in at 10pm, but the doors are incredible noise barriers, and once indoors, the ambient road noise covered it.
The views are amazing. The public transport in the immediate vicinity life changing. If we lived in Sydney, this is where we would want to be."
2017-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,14921505,Jeremy,"What a great time! We will definitely be back. We stayed over with 5 families and each of us had our own space to hang out and relax. The property is very family-friendly and even our dogs had a fantastic time frolicking on the beach. The beds were super comfy and our host Bailey was available at any time to answer any queries promptly. Thanks Bailey, looking forward to the next trip. Highly recommended!"
2018-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,22346270,Eros,"Wonderful and lightful home, amazing hospitality, very quiet and big room with direct access to the backyard, the other guests were very kind and friendly. Sam and his wife are the best hosts I have ever met: thoughtful, helpful, always smiling and peaceful.
Next time in Sydney will be surely at Sam's."
2016-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,8356824,Elena,"Great location, smooth check in & excellent communication. Loved the Xmas tree :) Thank you Sandra for having us at your place. "
2016-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Patrick,"Best value for the money!  Great location - walking distance to many of Sydneys best attractions. We loved the fitness center in this building!
Very easy check in/out process- pick up key, and leave key!"
2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,22068048,Leesa,We stayed at Lucy and Ralph's for a couple if nights with our 2 teenage boys.  The unit was fresh and clean and the beds were amazingly comfortable.   Beautiful garden bush setting and all the amenities were wonderful.   Lucy and Ralph were warm and friendly and extremely helpful.  Thank you
2018-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,20865085,Jennifer,"Blissful Bronte is an excellent choice if you want to stay in a well-equipped apartment, a lovely host and stunning nature close by! 
Public transport (bus stop) is very close by, and the city centre and the airport easy ro reach. A small shop just across the street provides you with basics, but Jenny even ensured that the fridge was not empty upon arrival.

The apartment is cosy, and you‘ll find everything you need. Wifi was stable, which is always important, if you also have to work. Cars can be parked on the streets for free. 

Bronte beach is a 5 minutes walk away, and less crowded (and thus more lovely) as Bondi. But the Coastal walk connects all Eastern suburb beaches, which is really great and nice hike. At Bronte you‘ll find nice cafés for having a coffee or great breakfast.

I would definitely recommend Jenny‘s apartment, and actually I already did! 
Thanks again, Jenny!"
2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,24848349,Niamh,I stayed for one night only - place is well located and is a lovely clean apt. Room doesn’t have a lot of space but overall I enjoyed my stay and would stay again.

2018-10-16T04:00:00.000Z,22412815,Akshay,"I had a short stay at Leena's place, but I'm really looking forward to a longer stay with a big group. There are facilities to accommodate up to a dozen people.

I was impressed with the immaculate presentation. It is very clean and nicely decorated. The well-lit kitchen has all the facilities that one requires for cooking. Just outside the kitchen is a huge entertainment deck for family get-togethers.

The place is located in a quiet, leafy street, where there is local traffic only and heaps of free parking. 

Within 5 minutes walking distance, off James Cook Drive, is the Kings Langley shopping centre with Coles, Woolies, boutique shops, restaurants, cafes and takeaways.

Just 3 minutes walk in the opposite direction, off Sunnyholt Road, are fast-food restaurants and specialty shops.

Vardy's T-Way bus stop is a 3-minute walk away with direct buses to Parramatta, Blacktown, Castle Hill, Hillsong Church and Rouse Hill.

Less than 2 minutes drive away is M7. For Canberra, go west and bypass the city. Drive east to quickly get to Sydney CBD via M2 in an hour."
2017-06-22T04:00:00.000Z,18620288,Jessica,Stephen is such an amazing host. Promt and extremely hemohim . The property is everything you want and need!

The place is also quite and you are just wake up by birds.

The location is perfect in the middle of COOGEE, with walking distance to beach and randwick for shopping and great cafes.

Georgia is a great host and we'r looking forward to visit again.

We liked staying there, the room was nice and cosy and we had everything we needed. Her dog is a big relaxed one:)"
2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Paul,"Great location and a large house able to accomodate a few families or separate individuals, each room is individually lockable. Very handy to all events or places in the Eastern suburbs. Great communication from the host, Marcella"
2019-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Etienne,"This is a very nice apartment at 7 min. walking distance from restaurants. It is ideal for a short stay. A small breakfast is included (cereals, few fruits, coffee) and should be eaten on the old chest while be sat on the sofa. Air conditioning is central, so don't expect it to have necessarily a cool temperature. The bathroom is outside the apartment, but close to the room. So you need to get out in a short passage that would normally goes the other apartment, but that is closed with a panel, to enter the bathroom. Because the top of the passage is open, when getting to the bathroom, you need to be quiet to ensure not disturbing the other people. Because that the only water point is at the bathroom, it's a bit complicated to wash the dishes, but Michele offers to wash it with her dishwasher. Communication with Michele is smooth and easy, and overall, it's a good quality for the price."
2015-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Sophie,"Belinda's place was perfect for a weekend escape! The apartment is extremely well equip with everything you would need. Belinda was a great host explaining the local walks and beautiful places to visit.

Thanks for your hospitality, would recommend to any visitors to Sydney!!"
2016-12-12T05:00:00.000Z,1944996,Antti,Annie's place was all in all excellent. I would recommend staying here in Surry Hills rather than the busy CBD which is still only a nice 15 min stroll away. Recommended for anyone looking for a place in Sydney.
2016-04-04T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Brad,It was my first Airbnb experience and an absolute pleasure. Lina was flexible with arival and departure times and respected our privacy with minimal contact. Although she was very kind and I'm sure she would have helped with any requirements.

The apartment look like on the fotos. It is pretty small but clean and cute, with everything you may need.
The only negative thing was the house itself, which looks old and a bit dirty. But I’ll be clear here: this is nothing what Jenny could change.
So, thanks a lot for your help and your recommendations! I really enjoyed Sydney and especially staying in your beautiful little studio apartment."
2017-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,9810515,Elizabeth,This is a very spacious apartment with a good view. Good for eating in or dining out at the local restaurants. A great base for exploring the city.

The studio is clean, cosy and modern, and Susan and Greg are very thoughtful, friendly hosts.
It’s within walking distance to plenty of good places to get a cuppa or a meal, and of course the beach. 
And if you want to go further afield there’s a bus just down the road."
2017-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Holly,Paul's place overall was great. It was located in a great place with enough privacy. It was just enough room for the 3 of us. The only thing I can say we weren't the happiest about was that we were using the blow up mattress and there were two fitted sheets (single) that didn't fit the queen single.
2018-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Kate,Lovely place and Richard is very helpful.

2018-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,9701620,Huong,"My first ever airbnb and Bryan made it stress free. Bryan was very hospitable  and accommodating during our stay. This little place is perfect for families. Everything was provided for little kids including a portacot, toys, plastic cups and plates. A little kitchen to make breakfast for the hungry tummies and if you feel like cooking everything is provided to make a proper meal. We didn't cook while we were there as there were plenty of restaurants and cafes on Glebe point road just 5 minute walk around the corner. Shops including bakers delight, a corner store, fruit and veggies and a butchers! Light rail (tram) was just a 5 minute walk away. Great location and perfect little home away from home. Definitely recommend!"

2017-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,12259367,Chris,The apartment was fairly central. Bit noisy near the bridge. If you are looking for a studio apartment close to town and don't mind a bit of occasional noise then this should be fine.

The apartment has lovely high ceilings and was cool even in heatwave temperatures. David had left tea, coffee, milk and, especially welcome after a long journey, cool water in the fridge. Potts Point is lively and full of great restaurants and coffee shops. Local amenities are great and it's really easy to get around by walking or by public transport with the train station just 2 or 3 minutes walk away. Fitzroy Square with the fountain is a great place to sit and watch the world go by. We'd love to return"

The location is amazing; Darlinghurst is a very lively neighbourhood, though the house' location is very peaceful. Within 200 meters is a busstop that brings you to Bondi beach or the Sydney Harbour both within 15 minutes. 
Also nice is Surry Hills, a lovely neighbourhood to go out for dinner or a drink, which is located within a 10 minute walk from the residence.
We surely recommend this place!"

The wall to wall glass panorama view of Darlinghurst was beyond compare and looking out at that view each night before bed was a joy beyond compare. I really appreciated having a bathroom to myself and the amenities provided by the hosts were perfect. I especially appreciated the filtered water in the room after a long afternoon walking around the city. The room was large and spacious and access to wifi, fresh towels, cups and a pedestal fan for when the room got too hot really made it feel like home and made it easy to settle in. Overall, this was an amazing place to stay. I have no complaints."

I won't repeat the positive and accurate descriptions below, except to emphasize that it is accurately described, in a safe and interesting area, and close to all major tourist sites. Linda had stocked her place so well that we didn't need to dash to the store when we arrived. This generosity is a reflection of your host who loves travel and those who do. Thanks, Linda. Book it."
2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,22297561,Mathilde,Sam place is really well located to visit Sydney ! Don’t take your car if ypu have one and jump in the public transports ! Easy to take and really near the airbnb ! And whenever you need tips or help Sam and her boyfriend are really helpful for it ! The area around is nice and quiet perfect after daily trips in the city to breath out ! And plus I really enjoy doing my yoga every morning outside with the singing parots around ! Will recomend it even more for couple to stay in but no problem if you are comfy about sharing the bedroom/living room with your friends or family as we did with my mum ! Come there and enjoy your stay !

2016-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Chris,"Desiree's Airbnb was perfectly appointed. The space is incredibly clean and welcoming. She had everything I needed for work and relaxation.

2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,1211285,Mark,"Great flat in a perfect spot. Close to Bondi Junction for travel, easy access to busses that take you either to Bondi beach ( if you don't want to walk down the hill) or into the city on either the 333 or 380. 

Flat is exactly as described and the hosts were in constant contact leading up to the arrival to make sure we had everything sorted. 

Great place would easily stay there again.

2017-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,8392955,Kari,Thank you Helen! We had a lovely time over new year at your gorgeous place. The house was so homey which was much needed for us during or travels. The place was spotless for our arrival and Helen kindly left us a welcome gift and also allowed us to help ourselves to things from the fridge and pantry. She was very easy to contact and get hold of both prior to and during our stay. Thank you so much! Happy New Year :)

2019-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Pj,"What a gem! just a few minutes from the beach and a short walk to the shops. Cathy pulls out all the stops in terms of hospitality, providing us with breakfast and even a coffee pod machine. There were even beach towels and a cute little bag to take with us to the beach. She even provided the much-needed and often impossible to pack pair of scissors, which came in handy for 2 people who had flown in. 
The room has everything you could need, a comfy bed and pillows, a fan, a TV and a fridge. The bathroom also has a large shower. 
All in all, a great place!"
2015-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Alf," Chris greeted us on arrival, no probs finding the place. Great drive to Bundeena, cottage is in a top spot close to everything. Belinda has made the cottage inside near perfect, 99/100. Everything is as it should be, comfortable, cosy, clean, private, just lovely, good supply of the essentials including some food items. We loved the organised disorder  of the gardens with all the eclectic bits and piece. Also the birds and possums did not disappoint. Lovely ferry ride to Cronulla. We highly recommend Belindas cottage for a relaxing stay. Cheers Alf & Polly."
2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,6201263,Vikash,"It was an awesome stay at Yoco's place. The location of the house is just fabulous. The house is exactly the way it is  described. I got to meet some really nice people during my stay. Although I didn't get chance to meet Yoco in person he was just a call away.  Specially when my room door got auto locked, he helped me in every possible way and made sure to call the locksmith and solve the issue. I must recommend this property specially if you are looking to stay around the city."
2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Roisin,This apartment is perfectly located. We had such a great time and Paul is a wonderful host. We got quite attached to our little home away from home for the week we were there. Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again.
2018-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Naveen Jeremy,"Michele's place was conveniently located close to King street. The bathroom was clean and relatively new. 
It was not that difficult to find parking around in the area (over the weekend) and Michele was kind enough to provide visitor parking vouchers just in case we needed them.

The large studio room has a door which isolated us from the rest of the house and we had our own bathroom. 

Tips
Where to eat: Cookoo Calley (near the Newtown station)
Cairo Take away
The rising sun 
Messina for desserts
Earl's Jukebox for drinks (slightly expensive but great atmosphere)
Blood wood for dinner"

You have created a wonderful environment for travellers  to stay and feel ‘at home’.  We were visiting our family who live about 10 minutes away from the Granny Flat so great location and very peaceful and quiet given it is no distance from some main roads.  The granny flat is beautifully maintained and sparkling clean. It offers all the creature comforts, including full kitchen amenities and if you just want to watch TV, Netflix is at your disposal.   George and Lucia are the perfect hosts, always there if you need them:). Thank you for the chocolates  - "

Vivian was a great host and really easy to get hold of for any queries we had :)"
2018-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Sandie And Naylin,second time we have stayed here. Excellent location and lovely home. Jeremy allowed us to leave our bags there as our flight was later in the day. Will definitely use again and highly recommended
2017-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Allyson,"The location is perfect as well as quiet, mere minutes from the beach and all of Bondi's bar and restaurants. Perfect for single or couples traveling that want all Bondi has to offer but also a good nights sleep. All of the shared amenities offered give it that 'at home' feeling and the availability laundry in the house is a life saver after beach days. The back garden and hot tub is a added luscious luxury and I always felt I could partake if I wanted.
Craig and Lee are very friendly and extremely helpful and the fellow travelers that share the house are ideal house mates. 
One of the best Air BnB's I've stayed in. Will 100% book again. "
2018-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Michael,"Great Host
Great house 
Enough said"
2019-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,20865085,Heath,"Nothing but praise for this wonderfully located, spotless and comfortable apartment in Bronte. Jenny is a warm, friendly and accommodating host with prompt communication; nothing was too much trouble. The apartment is adjoined to the main house,  but with your own front door and a completely self contained living space with kitchen, large lounge room, separate bedroom and bathroom, as well as respectful hosts, the space feels entirely your own. Five minutes walk to the beach and with a bus stop out the front, it’s a quiet spot but not too far from the action. A really great base for a relaxing stay in Sydney."
2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Chris,Absolutely loved this place! The location can’t be beat. Very nice beds/linens and nice separation of rooms. The air conditioning kept the place comfortable and the spacious living room with the large TV was a great place to hang out. Would highly recommend to anyone. Look forward to returning in the future.
2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,29974058,Tom,"Nice location, host where amazing and very forth coming on messages back and forth with us during the whole stay. Good overall and recommend it because it was a nice apartment with good security to get in and also had the necessary stuff you needed."
2016-10-17T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Zakiyya,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I couldn't ask for a better one. First of all, the location is very convenient and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. The apartment is clean, has everything you need, and dare I say, more than you can ask for. Linda wants you to feel at home and she succeeds  : we really felt at home. 
I went to Sydney with my parents (60 and 70yo) and therefore I had some concerns regarding their comfort. As a matter of fact, they loved the place ! They were really happy about the whole experience and this is the most important for me. Linda is really helpful, attentive and  flexible. We were welcome by a lovely note and some Tim Tam and we loved this attention. 
No matter how much I think about it, I cannot fault the accommodation, nor the host. I am really glad to have had Linda for my first experience, but the downside is that she has raised the bar for the next one ! :-)

2017-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Patty,"Basic room but has a cool and calm feel to it. Plenty big enough, bed is comfy and enough power points. Wifi works well. Can be a little traffic about in the morning but nothing too bad. Bring a washer and thongs for bathroom and outside as there are more room rented. Can recommend. Great coffee shops close by and young henry's brewery in the street! Check it out!"
2016-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Renee,"Simone thank you for your wonderful house for us to stay! We loved it! It was perfect, warm and welcoming. 
Our family loved it too. The little outdoor garden was beautiful for our champagne breakfast. 
The house is large, nice big bedrooms and plenty of space. 

We would highly recommend to anyone wanting to stay. Very cleAn, very comfortable "
2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,19990097,Poh Meng,"Home, sweet home, we arrived late, George had turned on the lights & music for us. The house is in great location, easy drive to Blue Mountain, direct train to town with only AUD2.70 on Sunday, free parking at the train station. Slightly far from city but we live like local, driving around the township is a great experience. George is extremely friendly & helpful, very informative. Jetstar lost our luggage when we returned from Melbourne, George helped us to keep the luggage as we were not around when Jetstar returned our luggage. Great host, great stay, we enjoy our stay."

2018-01-30T05:00:00.000Z,20962081,Alex,"The apartment is very stylish and clean. Though there 's a tiny problem that a room is in lack of conditioning since we are staying in summer of Sydney. All is all, a nice place to stay and only minutes walk to china town which need not worry to find good food to eat."

We were very comfortable and felt we had privacy too. The apartment had all the facilities we needed. Thank you again for the nice additional touches. We loved staying, it was very convenient and if there is ever another opportunity to come back to Cronulla in the future we would stay again. Highly recommend."

2018-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Miranda,"This was a great place to stay for a couple of days chilling in Manly. Clean and comfortable with everything we needed. The location is fantastic - very close to the beach, restaurants and shops but still nice and quiet for a good night's sleep. Would recommend."

Loved it"
2016-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,14223095,Jeryl,"The apartment is in a small, modern complex, very close to a bus route direct to the centre of Sydney (10 minutes). Shops and beach are close but a LONG walk.
The bedroom is A-C, very private with very comfortable bed.

2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Matthew,"This AirBnB is not to be missed! Home was very clean and there were thoughtful touches upon check in. I arrived very late at night and the check in process was quick and easy. The host had amazing and quick responses during my stay - great communication. The apartment has 2 balconies which allow loads of sunlight into the space when the curtains are pulled back. Great location for Ubers, Taxis, walks in the park. I stayed for business and I walked to the CBD within 15 minutes - easy. I will definitely stay again!"
2017-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Alex,"The apartment was very nice & clean, had everything we needed! Close walk to the Harbour Bridge & the Botanical Gardens which was great.

2018-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Ruth,Angela is very accommodating and her place is very fresh and clean. A great location for getting to the airport.
2017-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Abdullah,"Mohit was a great host, very cooperative and easy to deal with. He was great in communication and quickly responded to any question or query before check in until check out. Location is great to any one interested in eastern suburbs or to be near the airport. No much attraction within walking distance for visitors or tourists. Although bus services and green square station is near by and can move you to the city or else where. Will defenetly recommend Mohit and his place."
2015-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Mariana,Arnie was the best host ever! His house was amazing and not only did he open up his house to us but was also kind enough to introduce us to some of his amazing friends when we had an awesome mexican night with lots of food and cocktails galore. It was an incredible experience and I can't wait to go back again soon!
2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,友輔,"Thanks Linda. This apartment was pretty good for me to stay. The host: Linda was so kind and the response was very quick. Thanks to Linda, I really enjoyed the trip in Sydney. I definitely recommend everyone to chose this apartment."
2016-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Wendy,"Perfect Airbnb experience, with a host who knows exactly what her guests need.  I never met Miss D, but she gave specific instructions for arrival, and everything was in place and labelled, she had great recommendations to make any visit to Sydney comfortable. The room was beautiful. The house was quiet (I never saw anyone else). I would definitely stay again."
2018-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,16408272,Lyn,"Chloe’s place was fantastic for 2 girls on a reunion weekend could walk everywhere , circular quay rocks markets shopping everywhere just great"

2017-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Vicki,"Couldn't recommend Craige and Leonie's place highly enough! The house is lovely, everyone was very welcoming and fun to be around. Bondi was everything we had hoped for! The area is great for food with lots of very reasonably priced places which would cater to everyone. Craige recommended a fantastic Thai restaurant called Bangkok Bites which we ended up visiting twice in our five days there. Would also highly recommend the coastal walk from Bondi to Coogee as a must-do activity. Getting into Sydney town centre was super easy, there are multiple ways to do it but we enjoyed catching a ferry which gives you views of the opera house and harbour bridge. "
2018-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Liam,Great spot! thoughtful directions.
2018-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Julia,Nice apartment in the heart of Manly. Just 3 minutes walk from the ferry and a couple of minutes walk to beaches and shops. Definitely would recommend a stay!
2018-05-18T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Varun,Great property and quiet location.
2018-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,17027421,Kerry,Yvonne and Cari were fabulous hosts and made my month’s stay in Sydney very special with their warm generosity and beautiful accommodation. I cannot fault anything. They were there when I needed local information but never intruded in my personal space. I would thoroughly recommend this Airbnb in a heartbeat!
2018-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Romilda,"Very happy with my stay @Sam's place.  Cute apartment feel with modern touch and privacy. All the basics were provided. Well maintained and kept. Sam had a info booklet, which helped me alot with my stay and exploring the area- really liked that. 

Will surely come and stay here again. Highly recommend it."
2017-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Martin And Francine,"Staying at Susan's was absolutely fabulous. The place is immaculate, really comfortable and the linen is spectacular. The place has really nice towels ( including great beach towels)
Susan also provides you a very nice Organic Breakfast, yogurt and really good muesli. 

All in all this is a 5 star stay. Susan is very welcoming and the room has all the privacy and quietness in the world. Very recommended.  "
2018-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,22216525,Jay,"It's my first time to rent house on Airbnb . Fortunately , I choose Willyan's house . Willyan is very friendly people . It's very tidy and clean . If you like surfing , you can't miss this house , just walk 1 min than you can arrive beach , everynight you can hear sea sound from beach , it's very comfortable ."
2016-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Kerry,Had a great time at our reunion because Cat's place lived up to the photos and description and was just perfect for us.
2019-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Shahira,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND: If you are tossing up between places and Kath's apartment is in your saved lists - look no further, pick her place! The bedroom is HUGE with its on private balcony with chairs etc, and  your own fridge. The kitchen was well resourced with all the utensils you need. Great water pressure in the shower + dryer / washer for you to use. My FAV part of my stay was ofcourse Ruski. He is a gentle giant who loves a pat and will melt your heart."
2016-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Chia Ming,"The studio was clean and nicely furnish. The sofa and bed are comfortable, and the apartment has a ledge by the window with chairs to people-watch in the day. It has everything necessary for a short term and long term stay. There is a big TV with chromecast that was so useful when my partner and I simply hung in the apartment after a day of exploring.

Victoria was prompt in responses and prepare materials abt the area and the facilities that were very useful. Check-in process was very easy. 

Highly recommended, and will be very happy to be hosted by her again when I visit Sydney."
2017-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Damian,"Great place to stay! Amazing view. Clean, tidy and well equipped. Very comfortable bed which always makes a great difference.

Jennifer was lovely to deal with. I won't be looking any further for my next stay in Sydney."
2018-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Cath,"Private bush garden setting, perfume of frangipani, easy walk to a swim, or a coffee shop.
Fun to arrive by train and ferry."
2015-03-11T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Sidney,"Duncan & Ashlee's place made our stay in Sydney really convenient. Friendly people, very clean place, very close to Sydney (one bus stop to city), nice recommendations"
2018-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,John,"The apartment is ideally situated for public transport to all of the major attractions. Equally, many places of interest are only a pleasant stroll away. Vickie is an excellent host who fully informed us about the apartment and the locality on arrival. Lots of good local restaurants and a supermarket is just across the road. A great stay and we highly recommend this apartment."
2015-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,David,The room and location were stunning. So comfy.
2015-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Dominic,"Wow! What a beautiful little studio. We loved it. 

Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for two nights and it was perfect for us. There was enough room for two of us to stay but cosy enough to make it feel comfortable. Being in Marrickville, it is so handy to where we wanted to be. 

The breakfast Cath provided was amazing, such great hospitality. My girlfriend says Cath really knows the way to a girl's heart as there were plenty of amenities included with the stay, even a hairdryer and shampoo/conditioner, not to mention the fully stocked kitchen. 

Cannot recommend enough for either singles or couples. Cath made us feel very welcome yet with enough privacy that we felt comfortable. "
2016-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Nat,Mal was very accommodating and super friendly. We had a fabulous time at his place!
2016-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Patrick,"Angela was a very welcoming host. She was available via txt msg to communicate about arrival any time. Fresh towels etc we're prepared, besides a key, local info etc. The room and whole flat were very tidy and clean. Angela was a nice host, would recommend staying here. The flat is good to reach with public transport."

Really recommended!"
2018-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,James,Very well located apartment. A little dated. Some minor easily solved cleanliness issues but overall would recommend for a short break.
2017-04-12T04:00:00.000Z,16898275,Christian,"Trents place is an awesome experience while staying in Sydney. Its tidy, organised and just a short walk to the beach and the ferry. Trent is super cool and makes sure you will have an awesome time. His place is located in a quite neighbourhood. Definitely recommend this place! :)"

2014-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Elizabeth,"I enjoyed my stay with Arnie, Lorraine and Arabella. Arnie was very welcoming and it was a delight to get to know Lorraine. The house is amazing - very creative space, as you would expect with Arnie being an artist. The location is superb - very exclusive and trendy Paddington with lots of designer shops in the side streets as well as Oxford Street. Very handy to city and transport. Thanks for your hospitality."
2017-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,新宝,"位置离机场很近,很方便走过去即可｡房东热情周到耐心｡去市中心歌剧院都很方便｡房间整洁东西齐全,性价比高｡非常赞"
2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,22509800,Brandon,"Great location however photos were slightly misleading. There was no photo showing the bed in the dining room with the sofa bed. There was also some hair still left on the bed linen, sheets, and pillows."
2018-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,5993432,Teresa,"The apartment is minutes away from the train station. It has a lockable from door to the building so very safe for solo travellers. 
It’s in an older building but maintained and all part of the Art Deco charm. Was very quiet at night. I’d stay again. "
2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,Maddy,"Bundeena Base was the perfect place for a low key long weekend. We all especially enjoyed the kitchen, bbq, pool and fluffy robes. The house is close to the shops, multiple beaches and the national park so we always had something explore. 

Hilde went above and beyond our expectations, meeting us at the ferry to help with luggage and providing not only a portacot with bedding but also a change table, baby bath, bouncer and play mat. Our 3 month old baby had the best time. 

We hope to make it back there someday!"
2017-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,13302796,Valerie,Fantastic position - close to everything.
2018-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,17829178,Michael,"Elise's place is in a fantastic neighborhood and just a short and easy walk to public transit to the center of town. There are lots of cool bars and restaurants in the immediate area. The only real down side is that if guests are not used to city noise, they might find it a bit loud.  (I also live in a city, and didn't find it problematic at all.) I recommend this for a couple or a single guest who wants a cool Urban neighborhood close to the center"
2018-08-28T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Elio,"Great house- it had everything we needed for a great stay with two kids, the car park was wonderfully handy, perfect location for all Randwick and Coogee had to offer, quiet, clean, comfortable! We would definitely stay again if visiting Sydney. "
2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,23529310,Zohie,"A tranquil and calming space, up high with beautiful natural light.

A great space with our own private bathroom and amenities. Perfect while while in Sydney for work.

Casey and Larry were warm and welcoming. I would definitely stay here again."

2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Clare,"A great location for seeing family and also only a short walk to places like King Street in Newtown and the train station. Comfy accomodation and just as described, thanks Michele."
2018-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,19990097,Garbrielle,"I found George’s house to be impeccably clean and orderly. George made an effort to make sure the house was aired and cool. When we arrived George had turned on misting fans/normal fans in each bedroom and had turned on air conditioning in the main area. There was also nice music playing in one of the living areas. The linen was clean and fresh and plenty of towels were provided. There was an ashtray and bench seat in the backyard provided for smokers as well as a pleasant outdoor alfresco area. George had coke, water, beer and noodles stocked in the cupboards and fridge with a piggy bank system where you left money for what you had taken. We were very pleased with this and brought some coke as we hadn’t packed any drinks with us for our travels. Another thing I was impressed with was the quality hand washes/body washes and shampoo and conditioner that George had generously provided. This property is great for families with children as there was a cot provide in one of the rooms if you should have need of it. We were all very pleased with this property and will be staying here again if we need to stay in the area again. Thanks George for making sure we had an enjoyable and pleasant place to stay in. "
2016-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Jess,"My experience at Lorraine and Arnie's home was below average. When I first walked into the house to drop off my luggage, Arnie opened the doors and quickly walked away making me feel like an inconvenience.
The room that was given unfortunately looked nothing like the room that was in the photos. The house felt very cold, dark, and lifeless. The house also probably needed a proper clean, it smelt very dusty. The bathroom doors despite no opened windows would occasionally just open itself which was annoying when you're in the shower or on the toilet. I used the scales on the ground that I found and leaned them on the door so that my time in the bathroom wasn't interrupted. 
The wifi also did not connect if you were upstairs, which meant you were not able to use the internet in your own room. The pool could've used a clean, looked like nobody had swam in there for a few years. Lorraine also made a point that we weren't allowed to walk up the stairs in our shoes which is fair enough, however the manner in which she did it was like a parent lecturing a child which I thought was unnecessary. 

A highlight of our stay was Arnie's daughter Arabella, she was very well-mannered and welcoming. 
"
2018-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Rachael,"We loved the accommodation, Angela's hospitality and all the added extras (Bread, milk, yogurt and fruit in the fridge, hairdryer and straightener in the bathroom, along with beach towels, sun umbrella and beach chairs to take to the beach). 
Angela is a fabulous host. She greeted us on arrival and provided information on facilities, she was more than happy to assist during our stay and accommodate our requests. A guide was available on local restaurants etc. The apartment is a beautifully decorated, quiet and relaxing home away from home and only minutes from the beach. Top rate accommodation we would not hesitate in recommending. Loved it."
2015-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,1131054,Peta,"Where do I start? The apartment was just lovely and the pictures really don't do it justice. Very spacious, plenty of luxurious little extras, spotlessly clean, comfy lounge and bed, great leafy secure courtyard with parking and a private sunny balcony. We had absolutely everything there that we could possibly want and really felt completely at home... which is saying a lot coming from a couple of fussy individuals like us. In addition, the thoughtful food items waiting for us was a pleasure and Louise's communication and consideration for us was really appreciated. It is just so nice to deal with someone that is so well organised and on top of things. Lastly, the location was just great. So surprisingly quiet... and we found some lovely restaurants and boutiques at our doorstep. I would love to come back sometime and stay a week to just relax and enjoy exploring the neighbourhood. Thanks Louise :)"
2016-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Cecile,We really enjoyed our stay in the Garden studio. It was excellently located and within walking distance of the light rail. The studio was well appointed and comfortable. Susan was welcoming and very helpful.
2016-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,9735397,Bin,"A great experience the first time live at home locals, owner of the house is very intimate, all kinds of problems can patiently answer. The house is very comfortable, the family can barbecue, appliances complete, the location is great, go out to take a bus into the city center, if you look at Sydney's New Year's fireworks, it would be a good choice, you can see the panoramic view, if you come to Sydney This would be an excellent choice."

2018-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,25410221,Agustina,"Thea’s place was lovely, a couple of details like she could maybe add more utensils (pans, cups, glasses) in the kitchen and the hot water in the shower wears out too soon. She doesn’t have WiFi so check the ad before booking! She’s very sweet and  responsive. I really enjoyed the private and quietness of this place in my first days in Sydney! Thanks for everything ;)"
2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Benjamin,The apartment is well located in Bondi with sensational views over the beach. Check in process was easy and Mal was easy to communicate with. No issue whatsoever and a very comfortable stay.
2018-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,1944996,旻玥,"Annie was so sweet and helpful, even she was tired she still waited for me at her place , showed me around and gave me suggestions. This was the best location, easy to everywhere, and the apartment was super cozy and fashionable . I was so happy that I could spend these days at Annie’s place, this was an amazing traveling, hope I could come once more."
2019-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Christine,"Nice comfy place in the middle of the city. Close to Darling Harbour, and close to 2 train stations. Many good eating place just downstairs or next door, including several Asian food places. Or you can cook too as there are utensils for cooking, including a rice cooker. It's nice to be able to 'go home'and rest a little bit before going out to explore the city again. Friendly and fast responding host."
2019-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Melanie,Great intro place to Sydney.

2018-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,21625832,Sophie,"Jo’s house is absolutely stunning. The view over Clareville is gorgeous and the house is very well equipped, comfortable and immaculately clean. We would definitely stay again."
2017-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,18082902,Emma,"Cedric' apartment was really relaxing. I felt safe and secure and loved the sunsets out of the big windows. It was a perfect little sanctuary to come home to in the evenings after study days.  

There's a great little supermarket 10mins walk away on Missenden Rd which had everything I needed including a great healthy organic section. 

The bed was really comfortable. The wifi fast and the Netflix and coffee machine a bonus. 

Thanks Cedric."
2018-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,26829659,Kerry,"We had a fabulous stay in Homebush, thanks to the location and convenience of this fantastic property, which was an easy walk to ANZ Stadium, restaurants and other amenities:)"
2017-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,程,"离机场近,也很好找,为赶早班飞机住这里还不错,但房间较小,只有一个小窗,相对来说性价比就不是那么高｡"
2014-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Sarah,"We had a lovely stay at Bronte B&B and Greg and Susan were very helpful hosts. It is a little haven of quiet and not far from the beach and great cafes. 
Thanks to our hosts! 
Sarah"
2018-07-24T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Jorge,Anita’s place is amazing. You have a great view of the beach and the sunrise from her view is to die for. Anita’s nice enough to walk you through and kind of break things down for you. What convenient stores are cheaper rather then you just walk into any store and spend a lot of money. If it’s your first time which it was for me. She is kind enough to give you a list of things you can check out while you are there staying at Bondi or Sydney in general. Overall you won’t be regretting anything staying at this location.
2018-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Caroline,"Incredible location, cute little unit. Perfect for our needs for the evening and a close walk to the best restaurants. Waking up to see the markets across the road was a highlight. Be warned though, the mattress is a double only so if there are two you’ll be close!"
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Tom,"Great style, great location, excellent host"
2018-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,5224098,Reece,Great little place. Host was very responsive and the bed was comfy.
2016-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Maayan,"Stayed for 5 nights at Paul's, was very friendly from the beginning. Apartment is at a perfect location, close to the train station and a walking distance to Sydney's Botanic Gardens. Lots of shops and places to eat around aswell, a supermarket just a few minutes down the road was also comfortable. The apartment is at quite an old building but is kept up and clean. The climb to the second store with the luggage was a challenge but manageable. The place itself was perfect for us and had all the things we needed. Overall great value for money, perfect location and great communication."
2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,22337456,Anita,"Wendy’s place was just what we needed for our one night, post wedding stay. It was in a great spot, leafy suburb and close enough to local shops. The place was very clean and very cool on a hot summers night. Would definitely stay again!"
2017-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,17028088,Sonia,"Kathy's place locates at the heart of the city, we are close to everything from restaurants, parks to the famous tourist spots. The house is new, clean, well equipped. We get everything we need. It is so comfortable that we feel like being home during our stay. 

Kathy and Mary are great hosts. They helped us everything we asked for and gave us timely response. They are warm hearted and helpful which makes the whole experience so much nicer and memorable. 

Whenever we have the chance to come back we will book Kathy's place again, for sure."
2013-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Julia,"Hi Belinda, I'd like to thank you allowing us to stay in your beautiful studio. It had all the necessities and was in an amazing location near the beach. Just perfect for our little weekend away! Your artwork is very fascinating as well, I will get in touch with you about those shortly :) thanks again and hopefully we will come back again in the future!"
2016-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Danny,My group of 5 guests had an enjoyable and comfortable time at Sarah's cozy home. It is conveniently located between nature to the east and landmarks to the west. We're also very appreciative that Sarah was willing to go out of her way to accommodate our living requirements
2018-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,21612973,Jackson,Jackie and Martin were amazing and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable for the entire trip.  Check in was very easy and there were no issues whatsoever during our stay.

2017-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Steve,"What a fabulous space which Philip offers. The place is simply divine; so well laded out with quality furniture, bedding and fittings. I cannot speak highly enough of the place. To complement the apartment is its location on the edge of the wonderful Hyde Park. The place ticks every box and I cannot recommend it highly enough. From the first communications with Philip till our checkout, this was a first class experience. Thanks to Philip for allowing me the privilege of sharing this great piece of Sydney."
2018-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Rowen,"Fab few days in manly. Ziggy was super responsive and helpful, location was amazing. Apartment had everything you could want for a few days"

Even after my stay I can consult him if I need help with something. 
Highly recommended!  "
2017-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,8130620,Thomas,Sara was welcoming and the flat was tidy and ready for our stay
2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Kate,"Bigger than expected, this apartment provided the perfect stay for us in Sydney. Handy to everything, lovely outlook to the water and nice and tidy. Oriel responded quickly to any queries and provided a smooth check in/out process. Will be back!"
2017-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,18917356,Matthew,"Matt’s place really is a gem, it was exactly what I wanted… Clean, Tidy & Spacious. Matt was a great host, really flexible on my check in and out and great to chat to. Location wise it was great giving quick access to the city and walking distance to the bars in Newtown. Totally Recommended."
2017-06-10T04:00:00.000Z,17319927,Kerenza,"An awesome location and place to stay! Lynne is an awesome host, she was very helpful and flexible with early check in and late check out. 
The apartment was spotless and very spacious. The home is exactly as shown on the listing, close to the beach, restaurants, shops and transport.  Will definitely come back and stay here again! I highly recommend to anyone. Loved it! Thanks Lynne!"
2016-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Kevin,Angela was fantastic. I was able to book at short notice. The appartment is close to the airport.  The room is very comfotable. Everything was great. Thank you angela
2018-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,23510317,Isabella,Close to plenty of dining options and a short walk to the train. A Comfortable place to stay.
2015-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Bogu,Cozy apartment and nice host. Everything was so comportable. Location is also convenient to access everywhere.
2016-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Jarrod,"The studio is great! Belinda was not home when I stayed, but my partner and I were welcomed by her husband Chris.  He was also kind enough to drop us near the ferry on a rainy day when we departed, as we were bogged down by luggage.

The garden is in a serene location with a lovely view of a garden.  Plenty of subtropical birds can be heard which adds to the ambiance.  Along with the tranquility of the studio itself, my favourite part was the walking distance to nearby beaches and Royal National Park.  Both of us ended up at the beach during the morning, day and night!  All in all, the stay was well worth every penny."
2016-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,13852692,Tracy,"The house was quirky with lots of lovely artwork, as well as being very large easily accommodating 6 adults. The house was fully equipped with anything you can imagine - and if there is anything you need, it is central to both North Sydney train station and Mcmahons Point ferry terminal.  Lots of local restaurants, pubs, shops (IGA, Aldi and Coles as well as the fantastic Mcmahons Grocers).  Vanessa was very quick with responses and accommodating us after some previous accommodation with another host ended up being double booked.  Her information and instructions were well written and documented.  The house was very quiet and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and didn't want to leave."
2018-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Allen,"Good stay,thanks."

2018-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,6785160,Garima,"The place was very beautiful, stylish, clean and very comfortable. Carole and her husband were very welcoming and hospitable people. We loved staying at their house."
2019-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Michelle,Highly recommend lovely host who makes you feel at home and very welcome on her amazing studio!
2018-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,15920870,Helena,"This is a great place to stay and will make you feel to stay longer.  Nice place and amenities, close to everywhere."
2013-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,1211285,Christina,"We stayed for two weeks at Eduardo and Yvonne's great apartment.   They were very communicative and helpful, and set the place up to be very welcoming to our family. The apartment is very clean with beautiful views of the ocean and Sydney. The location is great! It is directly across the street from Waverley Park, which quickly became our kids favorite hang out spot. It was great for my husband and I too, because we were able to get coffee and great quality breakfast at the kiosk there. We were also walking distance to the shopping center, grocery shopping, and restaurants. It is also in the delivery zone of some really great restaurants. Bondi Beach is close and was a total hit with the kids. Having laundry in the unit was very helpful for us for our long stay. In addition to television options, there were also many movies including movies for our kids to watch, which was helpful.

The location is great, and doesn't require the use of a car to get around. If bringing a car, it is helpful to know that the parking on the premises is labeled as visitor parking with a four hour time limit during the day. It seems like it isn't really enforced and we had no trouble parking there for longer. There is also street parking on the block, which can be crowded during some hours of the day, but parking generally is pretty easy to find either on site or close to it. 

When we first arrived, the elevator was broken and we had to take the stairs up the apartment. Eduardo and Yvonne were very communicative regarding this issue, which ended up being resolved very quickly and was not an issue at all for rest of our stay. It seems that Eduardo and Yvonne are very responsive to guest issues as they arise.

Overall, our stay in Sydney was a great experience, and I think that Eduardo and Yvonne's apartment was a great base from which to explore the city. 

"
2014-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Ralph,"Cath is an excellent communicator and an outstanding host. Her studio is perfect, spotlessly clean and everything one could possibly need is  supplied. Even games, umbrellas, egg poacher and toiletries. Her array of tea has widened my tea drinking repertoire enormously. A folder was available outlining all the local cafes, restaurants, hairdressers and any other professional you might need. Before we arrived Cath contacted us to ensure her breakfast hamper contained things we liked. In additional to the hamper, each day we were treated to a range of treats including fresh eggs, delicious cakes or freshly baked bread. Even the paper was delivered most days courtesy of Chips the guide dog in training. After eight days we rolled out of the Garden Studio wishing we could stay indefinitely. This standard was maintained with Cath being extremely busy with an enormous photo shoot as well as her impending wedding this weekend. What a wonderful find. We would definitely recommend Cath to our family and friends and in fact have done so,"
2017-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Etto,"Really cute apartment. Mal was very responsive and kind, moreover the apartment is extremely well located. Great to live in it but not exactly up to the expectations for general maintenance of the house. There is a big mold stain caused by a leak in the roof and a pot on the floor to catch the drips. The windows could have been a bit cleaner and there were other signs of mold in a few spots."
2018-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Fiona,"My husband and son stayed at Michelle's Air bnb and said it was very clean, comfortable and central.  Michele went out of her way to make their stay comfortable and she was a great communicator.  Thanks Michele.  we will certainly keep your place in mind for future stays."
2016-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Liberty,"The house was exactly as described and in a fantastic location, communication was exceptionally fast, friendly and helpful.
Would definitely recommend!"
2016-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Hyo-Jin,"Susan is an incredibly intelligent and warm person. Her welcome was planned for in advance, as she tends to be quite busy herself. 
On my first day, I was given the rundown on the breakfast options, free wifi, chats with her pets, and the security of the household. The cabin was spacious, kitted out with a book selection, a digital TV, kettle and heater, pretty much everything. The place was pristine and my nights were very peaceful. My plans are to stay there for a retreat every now and then. Thanks very much Susan, for being so flexible and knowledgeable :) "
2014-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Dana,"What a fabulous little apartment in Mosman! We were down for a wedding and catch ups with friends and Mags' place was perfect.  Check in and check out was simple.  A bus stop, shops and cafes were a very short walk away and the apartment itself had everything you needed. Someone else mentioned that it was a bit cold with only a lounge room heater but there was actually an extra mobile heater when we stayed so we used it to warm up the room before bed and we felt really cosy.
I would definitely recommend this apartment to family and friends and I wouldn't hesitate in considering staying there again for another Sydney trip!"
2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Colin,"Excellent in every respect. I can’t fault the place or the host, Rhonda. Very happy with my stay. Thank you."
2018-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Bronte,"Great host, location and apartment. David was very hospitable and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Sydney. Thanks again"
2017-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,17829178,Nadia,Absolutely love this place ! Highly recommended
2017-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Jeol,Amazon location and an even better host!
2017-03-12T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Tobie,"I don't think the description for this place does justice to the incredible location or quality of this home. SO central. Beautiful inside and out. Well equipped and comfortable. Fantastic hosts. The two mums that went on our trip were a little concerned that the stairs aren't overly child friendly (narrow and steep), but luckily for this fact, we'd left our children at home. Parking was a breeze! I might never stay anywhere else when travelling to Sydney."
2016-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Gail,"We loved the vibe of the house, it was comfortable, had a great atmosphere and suited us perfectly. The neighbourhood is full of character and laid back, near the beach and shops, all round great for us."
2019-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,19238057,Luana,"Daniel y Elena fueron muy acogedores, siempre dispuestos a ayudar. 
La casa está bien equipada, tiene buena ubicación, a menos de 10 minutos caminando a Padstow station, a una hora de CBD aprox en tren."
2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,27009904,Jason,Very accommodating host. Easy to communicate with. Would stay again.
2017-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Larry,Very close to airport and clean.  Great value.
2017-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Matt,We highly recommend Nicole's apartment and her hospitality is second to none.
2017-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,12098138,Anna,"What a place!! What a host!! It s a dream, watching the beach earing the see lying on a dayboat bed. The place is huge and very close to amazing beaches and beautiful costal promenades... lizzie was a super host, very helpfull and carefull about us having a good time. 
The terrasse is superb
This place is marvellous!! We had a fantastic family time there we wont forgett"
2019-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,6046461,Catherine,"I stayed at Suzie's for 4 nights on a business trip. It was very convenient to coffee places and harbour views. As others have mentioned, the ear plugs came conveniently as the apartment is close to traffic. Bed is super comfortable and the fan worked well at cooling down the room at night (it was very hot in Sydney that week). Access to the fridge allowed me to make my own breakfast in the morning. Bathroom is not connected to the bedroom but Suzie was rarely in the path in between so was not an issue at all. Apartment is in a very secured complex and close to the Wynyard Station to get to the airport in 30 min. Suzie also gave me lots of local recommendations. Recommended for business trips where you spend little time in the apartment."
2018-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,22337456,Darren,"Wendy (Host) provided excellent communication while staying at her apartment in Roseberry. The apartment is very new and features all the modern touches expected in such a new development. We were both very impressed with the double bed (adjustable back and foot positions with variable massage settings) and felt the on-site fitness and swimming complex was a cut above the norm. A big thank you must also go out to the host as we left some clothing behind which was posted the very next day, does not sound very much however we are based in New Zealand so I put this down as very much going the extra mile. "
2018-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,17829178,Beth And Ryan,"What a cleverly designed apartment! They've made such great use of the space, everything you could possibly need is ticked into clever cupboards - it's as if Tony Stark designed a studio apartment. Great location a few blocks from all the fun of Glebe's main drag, and we walked into the city most days. Great value, easy check in, would 100% stay here again. "
2017-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,15920870,Grace,"Great stay here. Really excellent wifi, better than anywhere else in the country. Close to the bus stop, comfortable bed, nice tv with Netflix! Would stay again."
2017-08-04T04:00:00.000Z,2838442,M. G.,"Nice cozy stay at Rhonda's place, I would recommend it to future travelers to that area."
2018-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,18083735,Jacinta,"Greg & Maggie were the best hosts one could ask for. Their space was a home away from home peaceful, clean, comfortable and welcoming. Situated close to shops, public transport and just enough distance from the bustling city. We will be back for sure!"
2018-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,23493822,Mira,"We would love to come back. Sparkling clean, good location, free parking, easy communication, could not be better. "
2018-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,19846740,Kevin,Would be an ideal one or two night stop over. Lovely beds/sofa and toys for kids. Very little space if you wish to unpack any clothes (even if just one person) not much kitchen ware if you want to prepare meals. So I wouldn't recommend for longer stays although our family of 5 managed for a week.
2018-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,21127680,MbErYeol_,"房源地点不错,就在中央火车站附近,去其他地方都很方便｡"
2018-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,17045341,Nicholas,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Edouard’s place. Everything was perfect and Edouard always maintained excellent communication. Highly recommended!
2017-07-19T04:00:00.000Z,18345625,Taki,"The best location. An awesome couple. And even if you don't like dogs, their dog is beautiful, friendly. Great location. Fantastic room and gorgeou
views of the ocean. Highly recommended. 11/10 can't wait to return and visit.... Thank you so much for a home away from home..."
2018-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,22362742,Laura,"Clean neat space, ideal for people wanting to be close to the city, but not in amongst the hustle and bustle. Bed was comfy! Pull out soda was good too. Thanks!"
2016-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Gail,"I really enjoyed my stay at this Bronte home.  It was exactly as described - only better.  It was a safe haven - and easy walking to the best bakery (Iggy's) I've been to, as well as a juice bar, coffee shop and a couple of great restaurants.  Also not such an easy stroll to the paths along the coast (just because of the hills!) but no distance at all.  Highly recommended."
2018-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,Ian,"Highly recommended for location, cleanliness, friendliness, helpfulness and space. This place would suit families or couples looking for beach, cafe and restaurant break. Had everything we needed including secure parking that we can't usually get when we come to manly. Would stay again."
2017-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Katia,"Le logement est parfait pour 2 familles, nous étions 2 couples avec 4 enfants et l'espace était assez grand pour tout le monde et bien pensé (1 chambre en bungalow en extérieur avec douche/toilette).
Le logement était propre (intérieur/extérieur), tout était prêt pour notre arrivée (hiver à Sydney) couettes sur les lits, bouillottes, radiateurs à disposition et la cheminée feu de bois ! génial ! (vraiment appréciable pour la saison). 
Le logement est vraiment joli, coquet. On s'y sent bien. C'est confortable (lit douillet) et bien aménagé.
Les enfants ont appréciés l'espace extérieur, le bassin à poissons.
La communication avec l'hôte a été bien organisé, aucun problème pour récupérer les clés. 
Le logement est extrèmement bien situé, c'est résidentiel, calme dans le sens ou se sont surtout des familles qui y vivent, c'est près mais aussi loin de l'agitation des bars et restos...branchés de Bondi.
Endroit très près de la plage et de l'arrêt de bus (1 min à pieds), très pratique lorsque l'on est avec des enfants. 
Sympa d'être juste à côté du marché de Bondi du samedi dimanche.
Juste le seul point qui peut être un inconvénient pour certains : l'isolation, ce n'est pas bien isolé pour l'hiver mais c'est partout pareil dans les maisons en Australie (cela doit être appréciable en été !), et pour le bruit de la route (camion poubelle) et des passants (le week end, la nuit)  aussi, la buanderie des voisins est collée à la chambre/bungalow extérieur, mais cela ne nous a pas plus dérangé, c'était vivable. 
Nous recommandons vivement se logement aux familles, groupe d'amis qui souhaitent séjourner sur Sydney et plus particulièrement sur Bondi.
Merci à l'hôte Cat, pour nous avoir permis de passer un agréable séjour dans une maison à Bondi."

2017-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Mike,"The apartment was perfectly located and very lovely.  It's just as nice as the pics, and Desiree was the perfect host.  The neighborhood is wonderful, and the guidebook Desiree provided was very useful.  Definitely go to Messina at least once for gelato (we went twice).  We also loved the ARTERY gallery, and bought some nice gifts for friends back home and even a cool painting that I could carry on to the plane.  Overall a great experience and a perfect spot to end our trip to Australia in style."
2015-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Isabella,"Paul was very nice and helpful, providing us all the information we needed to know. We loved staying in the apartment, especially the location, and its interior. We would definitely stay there again! "

2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Nidale,"The one bedroom apartment was bright, clean, quiet, close to public transport, and minutes away from many cafes, restaurants and shops. The bed was comfortable, living space lovely and well appointed. The washer and dryer came in very handy. Narelle was welcoming, kind, easily accessible and responsive. Everything you need or want is just minutes away on King street. Will definitely stay there again on my next trip. Thank you Narelle!"
2016-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,12740176,Jaron,"Great place. Perfect for families or adult groups for that matter. 
Great location. Across road from beach, cafe next door. 
Great host. Couldn't be more helpful. 
"
2018-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,18315277,Georgina,Great location! Cleanliness wasn’t great - had to throw lots of food out from previous people. Inside wardrobes were dirty.
2014-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Nienke,"I can only join the other positive reviews. The room is lovely and has everything you could ask for. Hernan and Chanique are great hosts, interested and caring. I can definitely recommend this place!"
2018-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,16166535,Rob,"The house is large and first bedroom very nice. Second bedroom nowhere near as described. If they say it's a two bedroom vacancy, unfortunately my advice is not to believe them"
2017-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Amy,Have a beachy holiday in Sydney at Leslie's lovely place. A beautiful walk to the ferry along the bay or a handy bus just down the road make this a great base. We slept well here in the lovely place.
2018-06-15T04:00:00.000Z,18345625,Edwina,"Great location, accommodation and hospitality.
Very friendly family and cute dog.  Hosts were helpful
but not intrusive and made me feel very welcome in
their home.
I stayed in a lovely, bright bedroom, which was quiet with
a very comfortable bed and good amenities.
I had a very enjoyable stay and it was a pleasure to meet this host family."
2015-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Janet,"Paul was very welcoming and helpful.
Description was spot on. Its in right in the heart of Potts Point and Kings Cross. Very cute area, bit noisy on a Friday night but you can walk to the city, beach, through the beautiful streets of Potts point."
2015-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Janice,"We were welcomed by Felix when we arrived, check-in was easy as key was left with the concierge and Naveen was very flexible with the check in timing :)

Home is just a stone's throw away from King Cross Station, which made it very easy for us since we were departing Sydney from Naveen's place. King Cross is on a line that links to many places you'd wanna visit when in Sydney. There are also many cafes + Coles near Naveen's apartment so that's where we settled most of our breakfast + groceries.

Room + Home looked exactly like the pictures, tastefully decorated. Bed was indeed super comfortable & hard to get out of every morning.

Naveen left us with our own little space (room + bathroom) which gave us enough privacy but also helped us when we approached her for suggestions on things to do /places to visit in Sydney. 

Overall a great host & we would highly recommend this place especially for its location when you're visiting Sydney. Thanks again Naveen :)"
2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Mouhamad,"Angela was very supportive, prompt, the room and amenities were very clean. Thanks for your hospitality Angela."

The place is exactly as described, check in was super easy and Bailey was very responsive and chilled out. The views were breath-taking, we had plenty of space (most couples had own bathrooms or shared between 2), and the beds were really comfy too. Pretty much had our own private beach as well! All in all, a very relaxing stay and perfect place to escape and unwind. Thanks for a great stay Bailey :)"
2016-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Keyla,If you are looking for a please to stay close to the airport this place is fantastic! Everything was immaculate in the room and bathroom. I'm so happy that I choose this apartment to stay. Definitely recommended!
2017-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Rob,Sabrina's place is well located  for Darling Harbour functions. The beds are comfy and the apartment is well represented in the photos. There is a fair amount of construction going on in the building so check with Sabrina first. It was great to have a garage but be aware that only a small car will fit. Our CX5 was quite a struggle to fit in. Overall a good place to stay in the city.
2013-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Kristy,"Kerri is a wonderful host, she made me feel very welcome and comfortable in her beautifully decorated and clean apartment.

2018-10-16T04:00:00.000Z,26934151,Tracey,"The apartment is in a great location - on a quiet street within an easy walk through the Botanic gardens to the centre of town. Buses and trains can be caught just a few minutes walk away, and there are all the shops you would need to stock up also within walking distance.
The accommodation was very clean, well equipped, stylish, comfortable and spacious. The kitchen had everything you might need - including a coffee machine and pods and dish washer! The key collection/drop off  process  was easy, and the building secure. It was one of the few places we found with two separate double bedrooms.
We didn't see the pool because the weather wasn't really great, but we did spend some time sitting on the balcony enjoying the trees and the birds. 
All in all it was a lovely few days and for a very reasonable cost, thoroughly recommended!"

Lucy and Ralph were the perfect hosts, friendly and most welcoming.
The apartment was spotless and such a lovely space to stay. Everything I needed was there and loved the yard with the waterfall and visiting birds.
Would highly recommend Ferntrees and will certainly return for future visits.
Thank you Lucy and Ralph and all my best to you both."
2015-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Andrea,"Wonderful property that feels like a home away from home. Well stocked with everything you need to be fully relaxed, comfortable and self cater. Beautifully appointed and lots of space as well as privacy if needed. We stayed in the outside cabin - wonderful experience waking up each day to the sunrise and view - the room bathed in sun during the morning. 
Perfect beach location, amazing views and the sights and sounds of nature on your doorstep. 
Richard was very communicative, accommodating and helpful all the way through our stay.  
Will definitely stay again. "

2018-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,19990097,Kristene,"This was our favorite of all the places we stayed on our two week visit to New Zealand and Australia.  George was a great communicator, before our stay, during and after.  His house is such fun.  There was plenty of sleeping arrangements for 10 people; in fact, we did not use all of the beds.  We all loved the furnishings, which are eclectic, interesting and fun.  I highly recommend this airbnb."

L’équipement de l’appartement est parfait, la literie très bonne, tous les produits pour la salle de bain sont d’excellente qualité. Il y a un cours de tennis et une piscine sur le toit, et une petite salle de sport bien équipée.
Simon et Nicole mettent à disposition tout plein de petites choses qui font que l’on se sent comme à la maison ( serviettes de plage, raquettes de tennis, crème solaire, guides de Sydney, livres, bonbons...)
C’était parfait, encore un grand merci à Nicole et Simon!!!"

The apartment was lovely and looked exactly the same as the pictures on the listing. It was very neat, clean and spacious.

We rented a car during our stay , and the private car space was a great thing to have! 

I left some of my clothing there accidentally (silly me!) and Rochelle was nice enough to offer to post it back to me. I would highly recommend Rochelle's apartment to everyone! "

2019-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,24608152,Jenny,"Extended our stay, great location all as discribed, great host happy to answer any questions, great place for family or couples with everything you need for a perfect home away from home, highly recommend this as a base to explore the northern beaches..... if you can pull yourself away from the pool :)"
2018-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Taylor,"Cutest apartment, perfect area, great amenities and a wonderfully helpful host. Can't recommend Millie enough."
2017-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,16549021,Vicky,Fantastic location - short walk to the beach and not much further to the shops and many restaurants. Comfortable and clean with a good array of kitchen equipment if you do want to cook. Very comfortable beds. Perfect for a short stay. Railway station within walking distance too.
2016-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Erin,"Stayed at Susan's lovely cabin for a couple of nights on a brief trip to Sydney. Susan was very welcoming, helpful and everything was as described. Easy walk to the cafes and restaurants of Leichhardt and a very handy nearby bus stop. I would definitely stay here again."
2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,5604994,Nic,"Fantastic to deal with, lovely place."
2019-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,26829659,Susan,"Joseph""s apartment was amazing. Everything you need is there"
2017-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,19238057,Pascal,"Thank you so much (: 
I really enjoyed it"
2017-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,16549021,Ryan,Great place to stay in cronulla.
2017-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Milton & Donna,"A perfect location to enjoy everything Bundeena has to offer. The cottage was private, quiet and with a lovely aspect over the garden which can be enjoyed from the deck. We strongly agree with an earlier comment the cottage is very comfortable and well equipped with books, cds and dvds.

We stayed for 4 dayds over Christmas and found it very relaxing and plan to return."
2018-01-31T05:00:00.000Z,20962081,Ryan,Great clean apartment in a prime location in the heart of Sydney. Thanks for having us Min.
2018-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,17944310,Emily,"Lovely place, perfect place to lay our head for the night with all that you need."
2016-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Kylie,"Great communication with Naveen beforehand, felt very welcome & good quality inclusions with our stay!!! Fantastic neighbourhood, cafes galore at our doorstep & reasonably priced parking nearby. Good private room & bathroom with toiletries supplied & Naveen was very friendly. 
We come from the country so the road noise of the inner city was noticeable but if you are used to a bit of city buzz noise at night it's fine!! "
2018-11-05T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Alexander,Great weekend away
2017-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Samuel,Good
2017-05-25T04:00:00.000Z,13320545,Kayla,Jessica is so amazing ! She is so sweet and it is in a great location
2017-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,1907162,Kyoko,"Very quiet and convenient location, Teri was very quick and smooth in communications.  Loves to go back."
2017-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,12370710,Andrew,"Great! Such a lovely location, with the most amazing view out of the window. Try and be up for sunrise, it's a special time of day, the locals are in the sea before the sun even comes up! You can't help but feel relaxed watching the ocean and wandering along the walking track. There's also loads of good places to eat! You're only a 15 minute walk to Manly Wharf, then half hour straight into Circular Quay on the ferry. The commuters obviously take it for granted, but it's such an amazing ferry ride! Last but not least, Maria and Jerome are both lovely and very hospitable. Loved it!"
2018-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,26785847,Kishma,"Great cozy apartment. Just as described.  Quiet neighborhood, or at least where this place is was quiet.  A short walk to the Kings Cross subway station so it is well situated.  The staff at the Regent Court where you pick up the keys was super friendly and helpful and very responsive via email.  I would absolutely recommend to others or stay there again myself the next time I'm in Sydney."
2018-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Jim,"Everything is clean, the location is great. Angela is very considerate and helpful. The perfect place to stay."
2018-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,22509800,Kuan-Yu,"So lucky for us.We changed hotel before we arrived one week ago.The apartment is in a good location,near the central station and city."
2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,24863216,Lizzy,"Vivian’s place was modern, well furnished and clean! Great location, thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,19641701,Michelle,"Laura's place was lovely and immaculate. The proximity of her listing to the ferry and the available parking spot made it easy to commute around Sydney. The only drawback was the flight of stairs leading up to the apartment, but this was easily outweighed by the views outside once you arrive."
2019-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,31696863,Jodie,Brilliant location. So close to beach and cafes. Lovely relaxing time and spacious enough for 7
2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Glynis,"We had a nice stay, and were really blessed with great weather.  If it was hard to be outside, it might have been a little ""cozy"" for staying inside with 5 of us, but a smaller party would manage fairly well.  Beautiful area and view and Leslie was super helpful and answered questions quickly.  "
2018-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,20767798,Charlotte,"Great location. Flexible check-in which we appreciated. Pull out couch bed was made up perfectly when we arrived. The place is as in the photos, but feels quite plain when inside, bare minimum and nothing on the walls. If you're just using it for sleeping though I'm sure it would be fine. Needs more lights, not very well illuminated - not a big issue though. Best part is the location!!!"
2017-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Renee,"The location is great. Coles is right next to the place which opens till 12am everyday. If you walk out to Surry, you will find nice restaurants and bars. 

The place is cute and quite spacious for two people. It looks exactly same as the pictures on the website. However, the entire building is quite old, which makes sense that the place cannot be completely free from cockroaches and other bugs. 

There is a rule that you should use one towel per person over your stay, otherwise you are expected to leave a few towels for the next guests."
2016-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Christine,Apartment was very well appointed as described. Neighbourhood busy but not too noisy.
2018-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,8130620,David,"Sara was an excellent host, very responsive to questions and made check in easy. Place was clean, comfortable, as described with beautiful view and a great location. Would happily book again."
2017-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,19376053,Xinying,"A warming and cleaning house, it is convenient for walking to city. Andrew is a friendly guy as well. "
2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,20962081,肖霞,"地理位置绝对优势,达令港,唐人街,维多利亚女王大厦等,玩,购基本步行解决,附近超市,商场很多｡主人家很热情,友好｡一发现厨房没有汤锅,不方便煮面,跟主人反应后,主人马上送过来｡住宿地方干净,整洁,客厅沙发够大,可以铺成双人床,最爱的是按摩椅,每天玩累了回来都要按一下｡完美的住宿,期待下次有机会还能入住"
2017-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Peter,"The house was big and very nice, very comfy and Cousy.
We really enjoyed our stay and had a lovely time at the home. It was very central to where we had to go."
2017-06-10T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Lisa,"Perfect location. 
Great, clean and well equipped house.
Absolutely perfect! "
2017-04-25T04:00:00.000Z,4499095,Stephan,"Beautiful apartment with an ultimate clean design in a quiet part of Elizabeth Bay. Excellent cafes, restaurants and everything else you need close by. Dino is a wonderful host, communication, check-in and check-out were straight forward and everything worked out perfectly. His tips for cafes/restaurants were very good. His place is fully equipped. 
Apartment comes with a parking space, which is very convenient since parking in Sydney is either tough or unbelievably expensive. Recommend to walk as much as possible, since both public transportation and self driving are not much fun in Sydney. 
Should we be in Lucca in the future, we will try to book Dino's place there as well."
2018-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Dilini,"Evelyn was a wonderful host. The location was beautiful and we had a wonderful stay. The internet and phone reception is a bit patchy which may be a problem for guests who need to keep in touch with work. Otherwise, everything was perfect!"
2016-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,James,"Beautiful house - the photos do not do it justice, and Heidi was absolutely lovely to deal with and was ready to help with any issues that arose during our stay, literally coming to the house in the rain to fix the spa!

A lovely weekend overall, in a lovely house with a lovely owner. Would definitely stay again."
2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Eirene,"The studio apartment was what we expected and exactly enough for two people, the bathroom though was kinda small. The television was connected to Chrome Cast so I enjoyed that. The location was near the bus stop and a 10-15 minute walk from the train station which is King's Cross. If you're a tourist, you'll probably want to walk around the city center, which is Town Hall (two stops from King's Cross Station). It is very convenient."
2019-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,4872526,Simone,"Great place and hospitality, we had a short stay but it left a great impression!"
2019-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,24608152,Sandy,"The place was neat and the pool was lovely. Beds were very comfortable with plush pillows and linen. We had internet access and brought our own devices as no TV for evening movies. Did share the unit with a few 8 legged friends but to be expected as this is Australia. A short walk or drive to the beach and restaurants. Godelieve was kind and as she shares the pool and lives upstairs, she was respectful of our privacy.  Thank you for our lovely stay at your place."
2017-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Mikaela,"Really lovely home. Cozy, clean, quiet neighbours. Easy to navigate to and from, already had all the necessities in the house. Will definitely look to stay here again in the future"
2012-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Christine,"I stayed at David's place for 11 nights and loved it. It was exactly like on the pictures and very clean. unfortunately I wasn't around a lot, but when we had a chance to chat, David was a helpfull and very pleasant host.
The place is only a few minutes away from the bus stops at Oxford Street and shops and restaurants/cafés are practically around the corner, still the area was very nice and quiet. I certainly would stay at David's place again."
2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,20206764,Stacee,"Sacha's place is in a great Bronte location, a short walk to both Tamarama and Bronte beaches. The house was well equipped for self-catering, and the host was quick to respond to any queries we had during our stay. Recommended!"
2018-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Daniel,Cath’s Garden Studio was the perfect place for me to stay while visiting my friends who live in the area! Would definitely stay again. Breakfast provided was a very nice touch too!
2014-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Deysia,"We had a very nice stay at Susan's home. The cabin is adequately sized and comfortable. The neighborhood's commercial area has great dining options and lots of shops. The location is nicely situated for commutes to the city, airport or country. We'd highly recommend a stay at Susan's. "
2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Nick,Great place to stay.... as always.
2016-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,4919014,Melissa,"Beautiful apartment. Great location. I would love to rent this place again!
Thanks for everything Jarmo!
Noah"
2017-06-19T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Amir,"Great location for locals, think of it as a break from the busy city. Great location for other travellers if they want to stay in an apartment with amazing views. Lovely, quiet area with plenty of friendly dogs around. Really enjoyed walks down the river and really winding down at the local café (Left of Field is the best spot across the bridge)."
2018-01-30T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Lara,"Tracey is an amazing host, she is very helpful with directions and respond promptly. My partner and I love her place as it’s close to restaurants, shops and public transport. The place is a modern studio on top of a garage which was very tidy, relaxing and quiet. Would love to come back again for our next trip! :)"
2015-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Derek,"Jeremy is great!  Very nice and accommodating.  We didn't have much interaction but when I called or emailed he was right on it.  And helped me deliver a box to his place.   We were out of the apt most of the time so I can't comment much on the place but it had all the basics of what you would need.  Darlinghurst is nice and quiet, great little breakfast spots. "
2017-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Dana,"This was my 2nd stay at Angela's place.  She and Geoff are excellent hosts who really go out of their way to make sure that you're comfortable and enjoy your stay/holiday! 

They remembered that my son (5) liked a particular type of milk and ensured that this was the brand stocked in the fridge when we arrived.  There were also lots of fresh fruits and delicious fresh bread from a local patisserie.  

We brought pop up soccer goals and a ball for my son to play a bit in the back garden and they didn't mind at all.

There are beach chairs, a beach umbrella and little extras left for you to use during your stay that makes the whole experience special and easy.  They've really tried to think of everything that you might need during your stay.

The house is a 5 minute walk to the beach and a short walk to town.  As I was with a little one I drove more than I walked and Palm and Whale Beach are also a short drive away.

I have recommended many of my friends to stay here and I will certainly be staying here again soon!  Thanks again for making our summer holiday in Avalon the best!
"
2016-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,5993432,Wendy,"Thanks to Hugo and Oliver, we really had a good time in Sydney.The apartment is not only clean and tidy, but also in perfect location. It took us 5 minutes to walk to the train station and nearly 20 minutes to reach most of the places we want to visit. My friend and I love the apartment very much. We will recommend it to our friends."
2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Andrew,As advertised. Clean and good value for money.
2016-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Keri,"Paul was extremely easy to get in touch with, flexible, and kind.

The apartment was just as described, and the neighborhood was incredible. Public transit in the area was easy for bus or train access as well. 

Overall, we had a perfect stay and would absolutely return to this spot!"
2016-10-23T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Anastasia,"I had a fantastic stay at Naveed's home. The room was exactly as it looks on the picture, with a stunning view. Very comfortable bed. The location is excellent as well and allows you to explore the inner city of Sydney by foot."

2019-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,24863216,Damon,"What an amazing place to stay in one of the most beautiful areas of Sydney. Right from the start I was greeted with amazing hospitality, an extremely clean (and new) space, and every little touch you could imagine already accounted for. Vivian was so responsive and even checked in to make sure things were fine. The place was very comfortable (for two), well laid out and in a location that couldn't be any better if you like heading out to the beach and the surrounding areas. I primarily travelled with Uber Pool, but it was also very close in terms of public transportation options. Loved the beach towels and beach bag and the brand new shower. Air conditioner worked fantastic. Wi-Fi and internet was great. Overall would stay here again in a heart beat, thanks for the great stay!"

2018-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,24460964,Peter,"My family and I stayed for 4 days. The apartment is in a fantastic location, just a short work from Central Station. The apartment was clean and had a great view of Elizabeth Street. No issues with the check-in and we were greeted and shown the facilities at the commencement of our stay. "
2018-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,15312988,Cloudy,"As my previous stay, I had a very comfortable stay at Cindy's place. The room is spacious, clean and very comfortable! Only a few minutes walk to the major shops and restaurants and the public bus stop is just at the door. Highly recommended!"
2017-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,15745971,선희,"I reccommend this apartment. I stayed 27 days and had no problem. The host, Mohit and his girlfriend are really kind and warm hearted. safe area and easy access to city
I'll stay this apt. if I have one more chance to visit Sydney."
2017-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,16261574,Dean,"We have stayed here a number of times and always good.  Great communication from Jennifer and when we had a small problem, she managed to get it fixed as quickly as possible."

The apartment is neat and modern, with fantastic views of the city. The hosts are lovely people that are great to talk to but also respect your privacy. I'd stay at Carol and Ian's place again."
2017-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,15889399,Cheree,"I couldn't recommend staying at this cabin enough.  It was beautiful and clean.  It's close to public transport and places to eat, but most importantly, the hosts, Steven and Peta were friendly and helpful.  Communication prior to arriving was clear and accurate.  They ensured our stay was comfortable, but also went out of their way with little extras things such as turning the aircon on before we arrived so our cabin was cool when Sydney was in the midst of a heat wave.  
Great hosts, and a great place.  
"
2018-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,22295401,Rovina,Griffin's place was clean and conveniently located. And the bed was super comfortable. Griffin was also very accommodating with our early check-in time. Great stay overall!

2015-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,4164487,Marine,"If you choose airbnb to meet nice and friendly people, you are at the good place. The flat has a very good location. The heart of Sydney is served by regular buses. The neighborhood is great and quiet. Duncan and Ashley gave us a lot of advices. We had access to the kitchen. The flat is clean, the bedroom has a lot of storage and is very comfortable. It was a great stay. You can book without hesitation !"
2016-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Anne,"Great place with restaurants and fabulous coffee shop in the immediate vicinity.  We had an early arrival into Sydney and were met by Cathy at 9.30am which was really appreciated.

Everything was as expected from the photos with breakfast bits and bobs and great extra.

Would not hesitate to recommend and will definitely hope to stay there again on our next visit to Sydney."

2017-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Michael,"Mal's place in Bondi was just perfect for our quick weekend getaway to a wedding in Bondi. We enjoyed all the benefits of the beachfront location with the comfort of a nearby clean, quiet and cosy space to escape back to. "
2018-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Rebecca,"Really lovely apartment in a fantastic location. The double glazing in the bedroom and super comfy bed meant we slept like a log, and the rest of the apartment is stylish and very comfortable. As per previous reviews, Desiree's thoughtful touches, excellent communication and brilliant local recommendations really shines and elevates the whole experience to something very special. We stayed with our toddler, and the building/apartment has excellent pram accessibility. "

2016-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Vanessa,"We were delighted to have booked this centrally located apartment hosted by Sam and Gavin. They have been most helpful during our trip allowing us to check in the apartment earlier than the usual check in time, as our flight arrived at 11:30 am. The apartment is walking distance to most tourist spots and restaurants which saves us a lot of trouble having to travel around during this period. It was disappointing to find several items not working in the apartment during our stay, though we know that Sam & Gavin were not able to help as it was Christmas period :( the Aircon broke down on first night; tap in the basin was flowing continuously hence we had to turn on n off the mains each time we use; freezer in fridge was not working either. However, cos it was Xmas period, there was no handyman working :( 

Sam & Gavin were helpful to allow us to check out at 11 am instead, as we rushed to do our last errands. Thanks! 

What we loved:
- location location location! What more can you ask for, than an apartment 8 min from Darling Harbour and Townhall? :) 
- strong wifi in the apartment 
- plenty of extra towels and extra bed available 
- shampoo and body wash provided 
- fully equipped kitchen
- Chromecast TV!
- Fully equipped Gym and a lap pool in the building.

What we didn't 
- Aircon broke down on first night :( 
- there's only a fan in the living room, no aircon in bedroom
- the tap that flows continuously and having the trouble to turn on n off the mains. :(
- the fridge that couldn't make ice. 

We know that all these issues would have been fixed by now, so there wouldn't be much issues for future tenants :) "

2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,20206764,Bryony,"We had a great stay at Will's place in Bronte! The house was super clean, spacious and had really comfortable beds. The location was also brilliant, with a short 10 minute walk to Bronte beach. We would definitely stay here again and thanks again to Will for being a great host - also for the late checkout due to our night flight, which was really appreciated!"
2016-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Laila,"A stylish and comfortable apartment in an excellent location for our two-night stay in Sydney. Paul was super-responsive, provided excellent restaurant recommendations (we tried three of them) and had we had more time we might have even made it the end of Macleay St without getting distracted by another cute coffee shop. Bed was excellent, as was shower. Be warned that if you are a light sleeper this is in an older building in a lively neighbourhood - so it was pretty noisy out there on Saturday night. Thanks Paul and Luke (and Wendy who let us in as the hosts were travelling themselves)."
2016-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Eva,"We had a great stay at the apartment. It is located in a beautiful spot, ten minutes walking distance to Paradise Beach. Fully equipped. Molly was very helpful and made our stay so easy. Totally recommendable.  "
2018-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,17915093,Ania,"I had a great stay. Everything was good, friendly atmosphere and nice location. Highly recommended! "
2016-05-18T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Jill,"What a delight it was to stay in this very cute apartment. The location is an ideal place to launch daily adventures all over Sydney. Immaculately clean, comfortable, and convenient. Also, Wendy who cleans the place helped us with our bag drop and getting the keys. She is a total gem! "
2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Jane,"Studio 32 is a great place to stay...near enough to Sydney CBD with great local amenities. Buses are nearby and frequent. The room is immaculate, comfortable and stylish...I hope to be back on my next trip in 3-4 months. Tracey was welcoming and responded quickly to any emails. Certainly a credit to the Airbnb community"
2017-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Riccardo,"Small studio in nice building in one of the best parts of Sydney, close to many good restaurants and bars, not to mention several shops, walking distance (20/30 mins) to the CBD and very good connections with public transportation. Laundry options available on each floor of the building. Victoria was a great host, very friendly and gave us lots of informations. Definitely recommended for anyone spending a weekend in Sydney, or as part of a longer trip as in our case."
2017-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Mary And Gary,Hugo's place is in a great location to were I needed to be and perfect for my needs. Recommended to anyone wanting to be be in the centre of the city experience.
2017-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Helen,"This apartment was modern and tastefully decorated.  The location is excellent, with a lovely outlook over the fountain at Kings Cross.  Walking distance from the Botanic Gardens, Opera House and Circular Key, Rushcutters Bay and shopping centres.  
Plenty of restaurants within 5 minutes walk, as well as grocery shopping a Harris Farm Market and Woolworths.
The Kings Cross Train Station is only 5 minutes walk and taxi rank and bus stop outside.  The kitchen needs more utensils and baking dish to use in the oven, but was otherwise well equipped.  It was nice to have tea and coffee provided, as well as basics such as dishwashing liquid.
David was prompt in his communications with me and very helpful."
2018-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,22297561,Joanna,"Lovely, modern, cosy apartment. Friendly hosts, easy to communicate with! Good value for money! "
2018-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,9098095,Alison,"This was a fantastic find , especially if you’re looking for a quiet place, out of the way but near enough to get to other amenities . We thougherly enjoyed our stay and wouldn’t hesitate to come again if the opportunity presented itself."
2017-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Alicia,Danny's place is really nice and bigger than I expected for a city apartment. It was a great location and close to Darling Harbour. Would recommend to stay here.
2017-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,18082902,Yili,"Cedric's place is near the city, a very convenient location to all the attractions. This place is great for someone who would like to cook while they stay, having all the kitchen appliances that you need."
2019-01-30T05:00:00.000Z,23171144,Katrina,"Oriel’s spacious apartment is in a terrific location, just a short walk to Darling Harbour restaurants, harbour tours and water taxis. Plenty of shopping close by at King and George and we found the distance to the Circular Quay area (Sydney Opera House, The Rocks, Botanical Gardens, Sydney Bridge) very walkable. The apartment kitchen had all the amenities we needed and more! I’d recommend Oriel’s place as a great base for touring Sydney. He was very kind to allow us to store our luggage before check-in, which was a huge help. This was our first visit to Sydney, we would definitely come back. :)"
2019-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Beth,"What a fantastic apartment - spacious and well laid out. One of the really great things was the fresh linen along with a very comfy bed and towels. 
There was really great facilities including a gym which was empty every time we went! 
The location was perfect for our stay close to some awesome cafes, bars and shops and public transport, with central station only a short stroll away. 
We needed a slightly later checkout and Nicole was very accommodating of this."
2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,15747156,Pat,"Location location location.  Close to the beach and cafes,  this was a great house for our family.  Very comfortable and clean, and communication with Catherine was so fast and easy.  Thanks for your hospitality!"
2017-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Chris,"The apartment was spotlessly clean and had all the things we needed e.g extra towels, blanket, kitchen amenities, hair drier, as well as some extras we weren't expecting e.g. plunger coffee, tea & milk, chocolates.   The location is in a lovely area with several nice cafes and restaurants only a short walk away.  There's also a supermarket across the road which is so handy. The outlook from the window was delightful - warm sun, beautiful trees and great to just watch people strolling by!  Victoria is very friendly and helpful (thank you!) and provided us with tips on where to eat and visit -  including the market near the El Alamein Fountain on Saturday morning.  You won't be disappointed."
2018-05-04T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Marcin,"The apartment is very conveniently located, very close to the opera, the transport hub at at Circular Key, shopping streets, dining area in the Darling Harbour. The place is cosy and clean, equipped with everything we needed."

2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,26308209,Marcella,"Six stars. Great place, private and quiet. Close to airport, local shops and a fantastic beach. I'm looking forward to staying with these friendly hosts again."
2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Larry & Ti Juan,"I enjoyed my stay at Hugo’s place. It is exactly as pictured and situated in a great neighborhood surrounded by countless shops and restaurants, even a glorious supermarket that’s worth a visit just to browse. It’s easily accessible from the airport by subway train, just 3 or 4 blocks from where you get off. I was given excellent directions to the apartment, which is in a very secure building, up one flight of stairs. The unit was very clean, the water instantly hot and the strongest water pressure I’ve ever seen. The large desk and ample countertop made it really handy to spread things out, set up the laptop, etc. The wifi was fast. I didn’t watch any TV but there’s a huge one in front of a comfy sofa. The bedroom isn’t overly spacious but it has a large, comfortable bed and was more than adequate for me. I especially appreciated the room-darkening draperies in the bedroom. The place is quite quiet for being so close to the action outdoors. 

Ollie was a great host. He gave me a Sydney guidebook and pointed out places of interest, which was especially appreciated given that I hadn’t planned much in advance. He lives just a couple of doors down, so he’s at your service whenever needed. When I foolishly locked myself out, he was promptly there to let me back in. 

I highly recommend Hugo’s place to anyone. You could pay a lot more and stay at a place like the Waldorf Astoria. But I don’t like to pay a fortune for lodging when I can get a perfectly suitable place like this for a reasonable price."
2018-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,6785160,Bren & Dell,"Great place to stay, nice quiet house close to everything. Nice, friendly, welcoming hosts."

2018-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,5581269,Megan,"Delightful find
Lovely thoughtful accomodation
Only downside for those seeking it  is that there are no grand views rather an intimate garden setting
We loved the little beach for a morning dip across the road"
2017-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,19768922,Leandra,Robert was an excellent host and the apartment was lovely. Loved the sunny balcony. Nearest station was North Sydney which was a few stations to almost everything.
2018-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,27009904,Vickii,"Tim & Mel were great hosts! The house was very clean and neat, and location is great too! Tim also responded very quickly to my messages. Thanks for the snacks, it's such a thoughtful addition! :)"
2017-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,8242333,Phil,The place was exactly what we were after. The location was excellent and Kirrilly was great to deal with.
2013-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Diana,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Cath's Garden Studio and we're already looking forward to a return visit. The studio itself is light and bright, as well as clean and comfortable. Cath was a welcoming and attentive hostess who was not only knowledgeable and helpful with all our queries, but provided a wonderful breakfast hamper with home made goodies that really made us feel welcome. The garden setting and chooks only added to our experience. We loved the location and enjoyed exploring the adjoining areas such as Newtown and Surry Hills.
Thoroughly recommended."
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,16549021,Sandra,"Robert is a great host - super friendly and accommodating.  His house is perfect  for a large group - lots of beds, bathrooms and living space and really close to the beach and Cronulla shopping centre, restauraunts, train etc.

Would highly recommend and if we're back in Sydney, we'll be looking Robert up!

Thanks Robert for a lovely stay!"
2018-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,21988560,Grace,Tim went out of his way to help me out during my stay. He is unbelievably generous and accommodating. Neat little set up. Perfect location to the airport.
2015-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Kitty,"The garden studio was the perfect spot to enjoy a weekend for two in Bundeena. Beautifully appointed, with many much appreciated extras, and a very helpful but unobtrusive host I couldn't speak too highly of it. I'm sure we'll be back. "
2017-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,20906942,Vik,"The rental lives up to its pictures.
Brand new, spacious and well equipped.
Very responsive host. Conveniently situated. Good value in an expensive city.
Nothing less than 5 stars!"
2018-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,6046461,Bora,"Suzie’s space is awesome for going to barangaloo, which is hot spot for trendy people.

The house is, of course, very clean and has spacious room for the guest. It was impressive for the amenities as like the hotel. She offers enough towels, so don’t worry about the thing you didn’t bring.

Anout the host, Suzie is also very warm and not intrusive as other people’s comment below. In other words, you can have enough time to relax your minds. 

One thing you be noticed is suzie’s location from the Museum station has a bit slope. (weak though) So it’s better to take an escalator near David Jones. :) it will help you a lot."
2016-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,6785160,Shuting,Well designed house with two seperate rooms(one bed room and one living room) that you can stay in. Everything is clean and make you feel at home. Reasonable price and absolutely better than my imagination.   I highly recommend here as a place for short stay! Thank you Carole and Steve
2018-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Tracy,"Fantastic spot in Bundeena, virtually on top of a beach that I’d call paradise. Jibbon and the walks around the heads are magnificent. 
Belinda’s cabin is private even though you’re in her back garden. A very comfortable nook! 
Thanks for accommodating our early bag drop too."
2017-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Jane,"'' Eagle's Nest "" is the perfect name for such a great position in central Sydney. The views to die for and so handy to bus ,train and a 20 minutes walk through the gardens to Circular Quay. The best shopping in Sydney QVB and David (Website hidden by Airbnb)  perhaps too close ! Handy supermarket n an attractive pool on the roof . Very kind generous host and hostess."

2017-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Kathy,"If you are heading to Sydney and want a FANTASTIC place that is central and within walking distance to everywhere, especially Darling Harbour, then please stay at Desiree's apartment.  There is everything you could want close by, especially restaurants and public transport, the airport train is just a few meters away. The apartment has everything you could possibly need and more. Desiree's interest and love of people shines through in everything she does; she goes way beyond being a superhost.  Thank you Desiree for making our stay so special and we can't wait to come back, hopefully when the weather is a little kinder."
2018-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,25684995,Ella,"The apartment is close to some nice restaurants and about 30 mins walk from many main attractions. Very easy to access from the train station. 

Johannes is quick to respond to questions. 

I would recommend his place to travelers who wish to see Sydney but not stay in the busy central city."
2014-03-12T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Aileen,"Ons verblijf in Maroubra Beach was zeer goed. Het huis ligt ideaal op slechts twee minuten lopen vanaf het strand. De baai is mooi, met veel surfers en een groot breed strand. Met het openbaar vervoer is de trip naar Sydney centrum goed te doen. Met twee kleine kinderen was de afstand misschien iets te groot (zo'n 45 min tot aan Circular Quay) maar als volwassene is het prima. 
Het huis hadden we helemaal voor onszelf en ideaal was de tuin aan de achterkant. Iedere avond hebben we hier de bbq aangestoken en heerlijk gegeten. Al met al was het een zeer goed verblijf."
2018-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Hilary,"Convenient location for concert-goers, easy transport to and from Qudos Bank arena. 
Lovely apartment with great views."
2016-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Emma-Louise,Such a beautiful flat and in the perfect location. The flat was light and airy and decorated in a modern style. We were sad to leave!

2017-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Katrina,We had a great stay! Sarah is a really friendly host and was very willing to answer any queries we had. Room is very clean and has everything you need particularly if you just need a place to stay for just a few nights! Comfortable and felt private and quiet.
2019-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,16183477,Na,Near hurstville train station
2017-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Larisa,"A great place to stay for a weekend trip. Clean, comfortable and a great location, close to public transport, shops and restaurants. Miss D was a responsive and attentive host.

The only downside was that we were sharing the house with others and, as our room was near the front door, we heard everyone coming and going. But a minor downside to a great stay. "
2017-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Wenbo,"房间干净宽敞,听房东说现在是悉尼最冷的时候,但我们晚上没开电热毯也睡得很舒服｡房东人很好,知道我们第二天六点要出发去机场赶飞机,夫妇俩人开车送我们去了机场,从住处到国际机场很近｡另外,房东是中国人哦,所以我们沟通起来比较方便｡下次去悉尼,还会选择入住的｡"
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Noelle,"The place was beautiful, spacious, and close to the venue. Sarah was also such a great host!"
2015-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Adam,"I stayed in Nicole's amazing Warehouse apartment for 8 days and had the pleasure of meeting Nicole on check in. Everything was very easy and Nicole did everything possible to make my stay as comfortable as possible. 

On entering the apartment I had two thoughts. 1- this apartment looks better than the photos. 2- this place actually feels like home. Nicole has gone to great efforts to make this apartment really feel like it's home. Everything from the Nespresso coffee to the lollies and little extras in the fridge for arrival. I was so thankful for all of this. 

The amenities are great and a perfect, quiet location that is next to the city and so close to everything you need in Sydney. I would honestly say that this would be the most comfortable Air BnB that I have stayed in. 

The only real thing that I would say about this apartment would be that it is more like a studio apartment, as opposed to a 1 bedroom apartment. The bed is elevated in comparison to the rest of the living space and private thanks to half height walls, though all the actual  walls are common in the apartment which I was surprised about when I arrived. I do believe that 1 bedroom would be classed as a bedroom being completely separated from the rest of the living space, also something that I look for when staying away from home. In saying that, it's still one of the best Air BnB's that I've stayed in.

Definitely recommended!

Thanks Nicole!"
2017-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,15923846,Nick,"Excellent location, great house and fabulous hosts. Cant wait to come back."

2018-11-07T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Annette,We really enjoyed our stay in Tracey's flat. It's compact and very well designed.  The quiet air-conditioner helped us effectively through a couple of hot days/nights.  The apartment is very well equipped. Even though centrally located (minutes' walk from bus stops and train stations) it was very quiet.  Occasional aircraft noise did not bother us.
2017-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,17319927,Christina,"Amazing host and place! Absolutely loved our stay, would definitely recommend."
2018-03-14T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Rebecca,"I booked this studio for my cousin and daughter on holiday from NZ and they loved it. Looked fantastic just liked the images and was very modern, clean and had everything you need. Definitely would book again."
2016-06-19T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Daniela,Great overnight stay! Mal was very hospitable with excellent communication and was flexible with check-in/check-out times. Quaint space with lots of light and very comfortable. Thanks so much adding to a lovely weekend away!
2017-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Saskia,"Hugo's place is perfectly located for getting around Sydney, but equally for staying in the area; so many bars and restaurants and shops, you won't need to leave. The Opera House is only a 30 minute walk away - or 5 minutes by train! Bondi beach is 2 stops away by train.

The apartment is lovely; especially for single travelers. The bed is really comfy, it's got everything you need, and check in and out was easy-peasy.

I would recommend Hugo's place to anyone!"

When we want to go out,he will take us to the train with his car. More then that,he took us to the sydney beach by car and introduce Austrailian food in woolwoth in detail to us. And even having dinner with us together with delicious food. Thank Tim and his wife very well and if I come back to sydney again,I’ll choose Tim’s house absolutely!"

2016-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Megan,"Everything was as pictured and explained. The beaches, shops and cafes are all within walking distance so we didn't need to move the car at all. Check in/out was easy and Belinda is super accommodating and genuinely lovely. The cooking facilities were handy, we took pre prepared meals and 'zapped' them but also made popcorn in the electric frypan and Bbq'd too. We loved that there was some DVD's and books and games. "

2018-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,16070079,Wendy,"Gregoire was very quick to communicate and his instructions were very thorough.  The apartment was in a great location, very easy to get the bus to many tourist places in the city.  There was a grocery store nearby and many restaurants.  Don't be put off by the hallway as it was a bit shabby but the apartment itself was lovely.  It was well equipped and very comfortable.  Would definitely recommend."

Cute kitty cat will try to come in, but you can simply close door. I was here 3 days and saw roommates a few times. So glad they didnt party there. I had peaceful Christmas and that is what I wanted. Fair price and good location. "

We could not get a chance to meet Miss D but she was always available on the phone or message and I really appreciate this. I would love to stay again on our next visit and recommend to my other friends as well. "

2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,20044641,Sophia,"Communication was very difficult because she only can speak Chinese and doesn't understand english. The kitchen was very dirty, e.g. the dishes or the microwave. There was no oven."
2018-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,9098095,Andrea,"A magic place, a very unique experience. Staying in a museum. Everything just perfect.
And Margaret and her husband such lovely people.
My best Airbnb experience ever"

2018-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,Kimmy,The apartment was in a very good area of Manly. Very close to all the action happening on the main street with all the markets and the restaurants. The apartment was close to the beach but  also very quiet. Great spot.

The location is great, with only a short walk to restaurants, shops and supermarkets. It is also very easy to get into the city center as the bus stop is just in front of the house. I would love to come back  when I visit Sydney next time."
2019-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,22124796,Todd,Exactly as described-will return!  Thank you!
2017-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,19846740,Mia,Great apartment I’m a great location. Was just a bit disappointed at the lack of utensils in the kitchen and also we clearly stated that we needed a 3rd mattress however although being told there was one there it wasn’t anywhere to be found. Our 4th guest had to sleep on a cot mattress for 2 nights.
2017-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,20906942,Bryan,"The apartment was cosy for myself as I was travelling alone and stayed for 3 nights. It would fit a couple perfect. There is a double bed with nice quilts, it was comfortable for me. Good lightings, internet and TV were all working well during my stay. What you see in the picture, is exactly how it is. The Location is very safe, especially since it is very nearby UTS where u have lots of students roaming around. The location is excellent, very near Central Mall and HayMarket. I could even walk to the Fish Market and Darling Harbor in 15 mins.  I highly recommend the apartment by Xinhui. He made renting very easy and was very very quick in responding if you needed any information."
2018-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,21939239,Kate,"A fantastic find in a perfect location. Don's communication made the stay easy. A perfect, affordable space for a couple to explore the city."

2018-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,Barb,"Kath and her dog Ruski welcomed us into their very clean and well maintained home.  When we arrived earlier than check in, she offered us luggage drop off and even a shower. Kath has a fantastic location.  Only a 5 minute walk to the train station and 10 minute ride to downtown Sydney.  Our favorite coffee is the The Urban Piccolo (1 block) (Say Hi to Lucas) and The Tudor Pub for a beer and a bite.  Kath had breakfast items and was always willing to answer question in person or by email.  Thanks Kath and Ruski. We highly recommend your place   --  Cheers  Barb and Chris"
2019-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,30056291,Tommy,"Nick's apartment is well appointed and well located. The room is tastefully decorated with plenty of space and a private bathroom. I enjoyed staying with Nick, who was very friendly and hospitable. I felt very welcome and at home."

2017-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Kari,"David’s place was a great find for our pre-cruise stay in Sydney.  Our flight from California arrived at 6:00 am, and we were able to check in early.  We texted David to let him know we were on our way, and he met us once we got off the train.  He took us right to the apartment.  

The apartment was clean and described just as the photos in the listing.  It’s a short walk to public transportation and centrally located to all the sites.  Lots of great little restaurants in the area and a wonderful market on Saturday morning.  

David was a very gratious host, and we wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again for our next visit to Sydney."

2015-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Erin,"Wayne and Kate are wonderful hosts and extremely welcoming from the very beginning!  Place was immaculate and wine and chocolates were waiting on our arrival.  Our holiday started off perfectly!  

Then Mother Nature showed up.  Unfortunately, we happened to visit Sydney during ""the wettest April in 26 years"" according to news reports.  Winds were howling and there was even a hail storm.  Exciting, but not what anyone wants of plans for on vacation.  And nothing anyone could control.  

Wayne and Kate went out of their way to make sure we were safe and comfortable.  They checked in on us several times.  Made sure we had food (there were weather advisories, trees were down, Uber was overwhelmed, and we didn't have a car).  Loaned us their rain gear.  Even dropped off pastries.  No one could have predicted such wild weather conditions.  But we were determined to see Sydney and they were determined to make sure we were comfortable, dry, and safe.  Wayne and Kate went above and beyond to help make our holiday a resounding success even in the midst of a wild storm.  

Their spot in Tamarama is iddlic!  They have thought of everything.  Kitchen was well equipped and there was lots of reading available for those rainy days.  The views are more amazing in person.  The storm was fascinating to watch and the little beach cafe/park across the street is delightful.  Their apartment is on the coastal walk from Bondi to Coogee - loved this walk!  Fairly easy walk to Bondi (maybe not for a 3 year old or the elderly, but for most adults).  

As stated, weather can't be controlled of predicted.  But these two really went all out for us.  Their care and concern help make our trip so much more enjoyable.  I feel like we not only had a great vacation, but we made some friends.

I would definitely recommend this apartment and these hosts!"
2018-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,22412815,Clint,Great host. Good spot

2013-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,1098211,Carolyn,"Had a really great stay at Serena's apartment.  The location was great - we arrived at Sydney airport at 9pm, by 9.30, we were meeting Serena at the apartment and by 10pm we were meeting friends at the Kings Cross Hotel down the street.  Very convenient!

The apartment was thoughtfully decorated, the breakfast was simple and nice, the bed was comfy, the bathroom clean.  No complaints!  Surprisingly quiet for the middle of the city.  Would definitely recommend!"

2016-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Katherine,"Belinda & Chris were amazing hosts who were quick to respond to questions: provided much privacy; and were lovely enough to allow a late check out. Belinda has great attention to detail and a creative talent shown through the decor of her spacey studio. It felt more like a quaint cottage with a self-sufficient kitchen and patio, where we spent much of our time relaxing.  Their place is surrounded by beautiful plants and trees, and their location is so close to all the beaches and walking trails.  Thank you Belinda and Chris for a lovely stay! We will definitely be back soon :)"

Hernan helped me with so many things, i am absolutely grateful for everything. The place was heaven for me, walking distance to a peaceful beach, and convenient to get to the city and the airport. The area had everything i needed and i am so glad i have stayed here, wish it was more days :) "

2017-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Tee,"Our host Sarah is very accommodative and hospital. A pity is that we happened to be there during a particular hot period, and there was no air con in the unit so could be a little stuffy. But other than this minor point, Sarah’s place has adequate provisions to make it a pleasant stay."
2018-06-19T04:00:00.000Z,24916551,Georgina,Alice's place was exactly as advertised. Great space for great value. The location was also fantastic in that everywhere we had to go was within an hour. We especially loved the personal touch like the box of chocolates that greeted us on arrival. Very happy with everything including comms with Alice.

Also, the house locates in a beautiful town which is near the center of Sydney, so it's really convenient to have a meal or take a bus. "
2016-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Margaret,Great location close to shops and public transport. Clean and  spacious for the two of us. Even had some basics in the cupboard which was very welcome. Easy to follow instructions and house rules.

2016-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Anne,"We didn't meet Simone but she was very responsive to messages and made it easy to get into the house. The house was pleasant and close to shops and the beach. Simone had left a bottle of wine in the fridge, which we appreciated!  A nice place to stay in the beach suburb of Coogee."
2017-03-14T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Anne,The apartment was in an excellent location with amazing views of Bondi beach. Mal was very helpful with our late check out request.
2018-03-29T04:00:00.000Z,21568012,Henry,"This is a good option for a cheap place to stay, but only if you plan to be out doing things during the day; the space is very small, not a problem if you make the most of your time in the city.
      The wifi is great, very helpful for trip planning etc. Kitchen and fridge is small; I spent most nights out with friends so this wasn't an issue.
      David was very communicative and fast to be so. I didn't have phone access until the day I was to arrive at his place and he was available for info and plannin (Website hidden by Airbnb) Not a far walk from king street and some other cool suburbs, and its a half hour metro ride to be at the opera house for reference (Even closer to the airport so its a good middle point). Overall a good cheap place to stay for non fussy travelers intending on seeing Sydney whilst saving some money."
2017-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Kale,"Very affordable, lovely view, great place to stay if there's an event nearby at Olympic Park you might want to see"

This place is also a good way to meet people as the whole house is for Airbnb travelers.
Last, Miss D was very reactive, flexible and helpful to make my stay as good as possible!"
2015-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Huixian,"Linda has been gracious and wonderful, catering to our every need including an early check in and a slightly later check out when hearing of our fight timings. Very helpful, helping us with figuring out navigation and how to get an opal card. 

House is exactly as shown in photos, and everything was very easy. Very near to Redfern station, and my friends and i enjoyed our stay there!"
2014-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Chris,"Belinda was quick to respond and very accommodating during our stay at her garden studio. The garden studio itself was much larger than we expected, well-furnished, well-equipped and immaculate. Location-wise, Bundeena is a relatively close to the city but is a charming suburb that feels like something more akin to a 2-3 hour drive from Sydney. We had a great time :)"
2016-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Fotios,"The place was even better from what we expected. Nice and big and really clean. Everything you need for a short or a little bit longer stay in Sydney.

The bed is comfy. Noise from plane is acceptable. 
Susan is a welcoming host. She prepared fruits and breakfast for us. She is very helpful to suggest us what to do during heavy rain in Sydney. Finally we got to go swimming in Olympic park. 
Highly recommend Susan's place. "
2016-08-16T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Lauren,Very welcoming holiday stay in Bronte. Susan and Greg's little oasis at the bottom of their garden gave us privacy and allowed us to relax. Very comfortable studio unit.

Despite I was out and about most of the time during my trip in Sydney, Hernan ensured he had provided everything I needed in the room and made me felt safe and comfortable during my stay. It was great to meet someone who's so easy-going and passionate about people! :)"

2018-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Peter,"Sarah made sure everything was ok for our three night stay.  The room has aircon for heating with two double beds, and one single (as a top bunk) in a single large room at ground level. Access is easy and the house is in a very quiet neighbourhood. Don't plan to cook there, but there are many good restaurants not far away."

I was only there for a couple of days mid-week however would of loved to have stayed a little longer, dive into some of the books and enjoy the remainder of the awesome food hamper. Everything you need for a home away form home with a great host to match."

2015-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Patrice,"What a wonderful house to stay in - it is as described 3 excellent bedrooms with very comfortable beds, plenty of space for us to sit in the lounge, dining room or the lovely outdoor shaded area. Simone responded quickly to all enquiries & organisiational points with the key being very easy to access. We really appreciated the extra unexpected touches i.e. complimentary wine  & milk in the fridge as well as sauces etc in the pantry. The location is fabulous .... not a long walk to the beach or the wedding we attended, it is a quiet neighbourhood with shops nearby. The house is spotlessly clean. Having a garage was very important so we could leave the car there for the duration. Thank you Simone we'd love to come back."
2016-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Atieh,"The location is superb, the apartment is clean and has all u need for a short stay. We stayed for two nights and walked to all the touristic places.

L'appartement était propre, bien équipé avec une vraie petite cuisine et quelques ingrédients de base. Une corbeille de fruits était également à disposition. J'ai particulièrement apprécié la Wi-Fi portative !"
2017-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Jeffrey,"These guys were amazing and the house was amazing. There was nothing we did not need that was there. It was close to the city, and the house was bright modern and perfectly equipped. Have already recommended to others and would stay again"
2018-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,21971876,Jacques,"Great large room, with two very comfortable beds. One single and one queen, perfect for the two of us on a work trip. 
Loads of shelving to unpack into, with a small bar fridge for left overs. A desk in the room was fantastic as a computer desk for our stay. 
Juliette invited us to use anything in he kitchen for cooking, as well as provided us with delicious filtered water and space in her family fridge.
The bathroom was clean and sizeable, private and accessible, just across from where the room was. 
Access to the patio and garden through the room too! 
Lovely family and supportive vibe in the house, I’ll certainly be back next time I’m in town! 
Thanks again Juliette!"
2019-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,30412858,Justin,"Everything is perfect, I have to say thanks to the host."
2018-07-02T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Kuuipo,This little studio space is absolutely lovely! Had a great stay. Was delighted to find fresh raspberries in the fridge for a yummy cereal breakfast. Great off-street parking and in an amazing tranquil location just up the road from the cafes and shops at Avalon. Thanks to the exceptional host for such a wonderful stay!
2018-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,27716426,Catherine,"Notre séjour de 3 nuits pour 2 amies étaient parfait. Le lit est super confortable, Charles répond rapidement à ses messages et lorsqu'il manquait quelque chose, nous l'avions le jour même. Un bel endroit tranquille et bien situé pour visiter Sydney :) merci encore Charles!"
2017-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Yuan,Very good locacation! clean and comfortable! good communication with Victoria.
2017-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,20906161,Adam,"A very clean and neat apartment, provided by a fantastic host who communicates promptly, was happy to accommodate my very late arrival time, and provided a number of thoughtful touches like a bottle of wine on arrival. Proximity to Central station is great, meaning access to the CBD is very simple, and the background noise is not disruptive (and ends completely in the later evening anyway). A great place to stay for solo or couple travellers looking to get out and explore, or a business person (as in my case) who need quick access to the CBD paired with a clean, safe place to come home to each night."

2016-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Joe,"Had a great 4 night stay at Hugo and Pamela's apartment. The description and photos are accurate and the view is just as amazing as it looks. The check in process was simple and Hugo checked to make sure everything was fine once we arrived. The location is perfect, multiple train stations nearby and buses right outside. I'd recommend this apartment to anyone and would stay again if in Sydney."
2016-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,2900140,Allan,"The neighbourhood very quiet and everyone we meet were extremely friendly.
Anne went out of her way to leave lots of goodies which were much appreciated.

2017-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,16166535,Martin,"We used this magnificent house as a our base for a family trip to Sydney and loved the experience. It is a mansion, with beautiful furnishings and large comfortable rooms. Fei and family provided all we needed , including a nice welcome, fruit, facilities, and access to parking on the property. This is not your typical Airbnb, as it is a huge historic house, but we had all the privacy, convenience and comfort that we could ask for in luxurious surroundings. We will definitely stay here when we come back to Sydney."
2015-06-22T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Leigh,"This was such a beautiful experience so clean and fresh the bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on! We are investing in a new bed and sheridan sheets doona etc now!
I loved the balcony and would have my coffee there in the morning while reading my book. The location was perfect for us and Nicole went the extra mile to get us the milk froth machine to form part of our coffee experience. The hand and shampoo products were so lovely.

THanks so much Nicole we will be back! The smarties at the bed side table were a nice touch and the umbrella which we needed so thank you!!"
2017-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,12259367,Richard,"This apartment has an excellent location, great access to shops, transit, 
restaurants. The unit was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Loved Sydney and A's place."
2016-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Suzanne,"Staying at Hernan's was a pleasure. Although only for two nights and due to Australia Day we didn't interact very much, he was very kind and helpful with directions and public transport. He makes you feel at home very quickly. His apartment is very clean and tidy and situated in a great area. Just walk out the street to the beach, lots of shops and places to eat and drink, very close to the airport. At the beach you can see the planes arrive and depart and ships sail into Botany Bay. The only thing one should consider is that his apartment is on the second floor, no elevator, so if you are not travelling light, then you need to be fit.
I had a great stay and hope to chat a bit more next time. "
2016-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Brent,Everything was great.  Great location.  Great place.  Would highly recommend it.

2017-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Ishani,Everything was absolutely beautiful. Self check-in was perfect for our circumstances. The treehouse was idyllic and all of the amenities were beautiful. Communication with the host was outstanding. Would stay here again!
2015-07-27T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Warren,Felt very welcome and Belinda accommodated both my late arrival and (slightly) late departure! The description is spot on and a lovely quiet spot in Bundeena...
2017-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Fernanda,"Fiquei hospedada nessa casa por 14 dias juntamente com minha mãe e tudo foi muito bom! Casa limpa, toalhas e lençóis limpos e à disposição. Quando tivemos alga dúvida ou problema foi logo resolvido pela querida Natasa! Localização excelente perto da estação de metrô e a uma caminhada não muito longa dos ônibus e supermercados. Indico essa casa para quem quiser ficar em Sydney por um valor bom e localização boa. "
2017-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Peggy & Jeff,"Tout était parfait !

2017-06-29T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,Stephanie,"This place was just perfect for our stay. We are locals that needed a ""staycation"" so we know the area well, and it is in the loveliest location. Beautifully styled and safe for my 3 kids. Would definitely stay there again (even though we live only a few minutes away)!! Actually, I will definitely be calling Anita again when I have guests in town that need accommodation."
2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Emily,"Susan's kindness and careful consideration to accommodate to my needs began before I had even arrived at her beautiful little cabin. 
I was made to feel comfortable, warm, and well looked after. The cabin stay was just the perfect size for 2 or 3 guests. 
I enjoyed the bathroom fascilitiles also, as they were a good size. There are 2 mirrors, one in bedroom/living room, and 1 in the bathroom, which was perfect. 
We were also able to spend time in the kitchen and living areas inside the main house. 
Affordable, comfortable, close to beautiful Italian quisine, close to bus stops for transport into the city. 
Thank you for such a wonderful stay in an architecturally stunning suburb such as leichhardt. 
I will definitely consider staying again if I was to be in the area. 
Emily."
2017-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,14921505,Kelley,"We had the most amazing time. The house was perfect in every way to accommodate our large family. The location is central to everything and right on the beach. It was also perfectly for the children.
The water views were stunning, the living space was beautiful with the open fire place and the beds were really comfortable.
We can't wait to return and stay there again, it was truly the most perfect place."
2018-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,5549057,Kloe,"Good location and tidy place. Worth to stayed for 2 nights and we definitely love to enjoy the night view of Bondi beach from balcony. The host Brendan is very friendly to share place includes everything in Kitchen. It’s very helpful for us with 2 years old child. Also, Brendan spent time to drive us around the town and even to airport when we leave! It’s unexpected to have such a amazing guide."
2015-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Simon,"We were made us feel very welcome. Lovely studio at the bottom of the garden with a very comfy queen bed.

My partner and I stayed for two nights and we had a great time, Naveen, Tristan and Felix are very accommodating and the room is perfectly located. Will be back for sure. "
2018-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,10213499,Ann,Beautiful tropical surrounds. Pretty and private space and very well appointed. Has everything you need for a great stay. Nice and quiet and close enough to walk to main centre.
2018-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,24477058,Sue,"Apartment is wonderful, and in great location - easy to get to the city and the west. Very close to the water and a great walking path nearby.  Quiet location. Undercover parking is very handy."

2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Jeffy,"This is my fifth or sixth times I stayed with Airbnb, and all I can say is this is the best experience I’ve ever had! Tracey is a very nice and caring owner, she always answer to my questions in a short period of time, very responsive. The apartment is very clean and new, with a modern interior and stylish decorations. The location is convenient, only 10 -15 mins driving distance to the city. If I ever go back to Sydney I would definitely stay there again, highly recommended."
2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Ruth,Rhonda’s place is welcoming and it’s easy to relax. The best place.

2018-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Jennifer,"Michele’s B&B is wonderfully located near cosmopolitan Newtown. 10 minute walk to Newtown Station while also being in a quiet area. Lovely presented room, spotlessly clean and comfortable . Perfect for a Sydney visit."
2018-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,26308209,Kathryn,This is such a perfect self contained unit for a solo traveller. Gail is such a generous host and the room was beautiful and sparkling clean. I loved my stay here and look forward to my next visit .
2019-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,7439246,Amy,"We cannot wait to return to this charming apartment!  Nathan and April go above and beyond as hosts.  Great location, easy public transport and excellent value. Amazing beach across the street, great for families and or couple retreat. Cafes galore, tics all the boxes for a great getaway."
2016-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,4499095,Beth,"Dino's apartment is great. It's in a neighborhood that is ""real"" (changing for the better with few tourists) with plenty of great restaurants (we recommend Cho Cho San and Ms G's - both easy walks). His style is appealing, quite minimalist with no handles showing, all white and mirrors, and easy furniture. We appreciated having a balcony to sit on with a glass of wine after sightseeing. Even though we didn't meet Dino himself, communications were easy and efficient and he arranged for us to arrive early after our 17 hour flight from the US (6 AM arrival at SYD). Public transport is very convenient, both bus and train. We walked to Circular Quay to start our first day. We highly recommend a stay at Ithaca Gardens! Thank you, Dino. "
2017-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,5511614,Brian,"Just checked out after another 2 week stay in Lea's fantastic apartment. Both Lea and Rohan are great to deal with and nothing was ever an issue. This was my 3rd stay for work at their beautiful apartment. Only downside over the 2 weeks was the weather but good as the guys are, even that was beyond their control. 
Thanks a million for everything, Lea - don't expect to be back any time soon but if I do will certainly get in touch. 
Cheers,
Brian"
2016-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,4502957,Catalina,"We had great holidays at Hanna's house. The place is beautiful and very comfortable. Specially the kitchen and the garden.  The location is perfect. Hanna was a very good host, very helpful and kind with small details. Highly recommendable to spend holidays with the family! "
2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Alena,It was nice to stay here. A bit dirty inside though. Very close to everything you need. Close to Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Lovely staff.
2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Lynsey,Great experience. Rachel sent detailed instructions for finding and getting access to the flat. The flat was very clean and comfortable. Easy 2 minutes walk to military rd with lots of shops and cafes or a 15 minute walk to the ferry. Great place I'll definitely recommend
2017-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Janu,"the stay was okay with a great and friendly host.
it would be better if there is a heater in the room as it was freezing cold in the night. otherwise there was no any other problems."
2016-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Elizabeth,"This apartment is run (and owned?) by a management company. It clearly isn't actually anyone's home and has the clinical, impersonal feel of a hotel. But it's well equipped for a stay in the centre of Sydney and the location is very convenient for Darling Harbour. I never met the named host; I was 'checked in' (their words) by someone else who was clearly in a tearing hurry. Beforehand I was just told I would be met, I didn't know where this would be but I couldn't get into the building and had to wait outside in the street. 
There is no hairdryer or air conditioning (this will make it v hot in the height of summer) and the oven is complicated to work. The design of the building means the apartment overlooks and is overlooked by other apartments and there was some noise at night from neighbours as the units are close together. There is also traffic noise. We were only given one set of keys which was extremely inconvenient. On the plus side the apartment building has a small pool and gym."
2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,19270950,Paul,Walking distance to Green Square station.
2016-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,7920463,Chris,All very good once again
2017-01-30T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Don,Clean comfortable room with bathroom right beside it for your private use. Friendly hostess who has provides a pleasant staying experience. Walking distance to transport shops restaurants and the beach.

2017-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Jacquie,"Danny's apartment was good value - located just a short walk to Darling Harbour and with great views.  It was clean, comfortable and just what we needed for our quick visit to Sydney.  Danny was helpful and communicative from the very beginning of our booking. Many thanks!"
2019-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,20767798,Claudia,"This apartment is in the perfect location in Sydney: 5 mins walk to Circular Quay, Botanical Gardens and the Opera House. This was perfect for our short stay as we got to see a lot of Sydney in a short time and felt like we were right in the middle of everything. The flat is nice and clean and big enough for the five of us ( all adults) to comfortably sleep at night, maybe not so much for families with small children who want to spend a lot of time in the flat - but who would want that, it's Sydney and there's so much to see. Thanks for a great stay!"
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,7439246,Micheal,"Great location, nice apartment and good communication. Thanks for having us Nathan"
2016-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Jacqueline,"Given the location, it was good value for the cost. We had issues with the elevator, but that can't be fixed by the host. "
2015-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,6785160,Christophe,"I had the privilege to stay at Carole and Steeve's house for a night. I was also disappointed cause I had to leave Sydney earlier than I expected.
this couple made me feel really confortable. I really enjoyed my stay in their house. And I've been touched by the fact they proposed me to  eat together, the first evening. They are really open minded and kind persons. The bed was confortable. The bathroom is really big. Even if they start on airbnb, they behave like they're on many years ago, because they are travelers. So they're curious and they know what you need. 
You'll feel at home. Rent it; that's an order :) (french joke)"
2018-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Sam,"Beds were hard , pillows were as flat as pancakes , with no spares . Never once saw the host .
You can’t wheel your suitcase up to the unit as it’s paved with pebbles .
Living area and bedrooms was clean. No fresh ice in the freezer"
2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Lachlan,Awesome place. The view was incredible and the apartment just perfect. Strongly recommend
2016-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Debbie,Rachel's house was perfect for us - it's just as  shown on the photographs and close to transport and shopping.  We were flying in early in the morning and Rachel was very accommodating allowing us to access the property early.  We were there for 9 nights in preparation for my daughter's wedding and it really felt like home from home.  We didn't  meet Rachel but did contact her a couple of times and she always respond quickly.
2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,17223695,Angelina,"Great place to stay and very handy to all locations, we very much enjoyed our stay thank you Anita"

2017-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Marion,"Beautiful independent studio, easy access to transport, to the beach, and the Bronte shops. We had a lovely stay, the hosts were very welcoming and friendly. The studio is very quiet, at the back of Susan's lovely property, with its private entrance at the back of the garden . It is nicely furbished, and with all amenities, and lovely touches such as fresh fruits, fresh flowers, and good products for breakfast (and no problem with accomodating for dietary requirements). A great place to stay! "
2017-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,10091713,Roger,"Great location for work or holiday, clean, lots to explore in the neighborhood, a stress free stay, thanks Ben"

2014-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Craig,"A beautiful apartment in a beautiful part of the world! Evelyn was vey helpful and responsive, willing to help us anyway she could to ensure an enjoyable stay. When we arrived, she gave us a quick tour and then left us to make ourselves at home, but was just a quick call away if needed. A bowl of Fresh Fruit, Tea & Coffee, Yoghurts in the Fridge and a bottle of Australian Red wine (which didn't last long) were left to welcome us. The area is very peaceful, but only a 20 minute walk to the shops, cafes & beach of Avalon, from where you can catch a bus for the short trip up to Palm beach. I strongly recommend taking the walk up the Barrenjoey Headland. The views up by the lighthouse are spectacular and made for the ideal setting for my marriage proposal..... and she said YES!!! The perfect end to a perfect weekend away. We will be back!
Thank you Evelyn x"

2016-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Martin & Annie,We needed a base in Sydney for two weeks work and Louise & John's place worked perfectly. It was probably a little better equipped than described: always great to get back to.
2016-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Nina,Had a lovely short stay at Susan's place. She even took the trouble to forward my forgotten phone charger to me!  Thanks Susan
2016-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Jason,Michy's backyard cabin was brilliant.  It was  wonderful to be able to walk across the road and launch our kayaks for a morning paddle on the Pittwater. Thank you for making us feel so welcome.

2014-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Caglar,"Although it was a short business trip, I couldn't have picked a better place. The house is great with every aspect. Very nice, quite neighborhood. Thanks Bernadette for your kindness and everything.

2015-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Phillip,"We had such a lovely time at this super location right opposite the water. The unit is well-appointed, with quality furnishings & linen. It was nice to have a sweet home-baked slice on our arrival. Hope to be back again soon :-)"
2017-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Carole,Our second visit to Bronte and to this studio. We do love it. Thank you for everything you do to make our stay so lovely.

2019-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,16261574,Jackie,The view from the apartment is spectacular and it is really well located. Convenient bus from Strathfield station stops at the door.  Only negative was I had asthma while (Website hidden by Airbnb) idea why and I havent had it for years.  Maybe dust or an air-freshener. Thanks Jennifer everything else was perfect

2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,13333143,Jennifer,"A great spot in the heart of manly beach- close to the Main Street and a block off the beach. 
Ziggy’s place is spotlessly clean and he is a very attentive & accommodating host.

The only negative is that the sofa bed is not too comfortable- (mattress is thin and sags in the middle) but probably fine for a small child. 

I highly recommend this place."
2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Kim,Excellent location and great communication very clean and lovely apartment thank you we would stay again

2018-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Christina Josephine,Lina is a wonderful Host! Her Airbnb is fabulous. Great bed and fridge :) The washing machine is a big plus. Amazing cute little house.

2019-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Katelyn,"Can’t pick out anything bad about our stay at studio 32. Very comfortable, stylish and homely apartment"
2018-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,25977467,Deanna,This apartment was ideally situated for darling harbour just a very short walk away. The apartment was clean and tidy and the bed was comfy. Even the sofa bed was comfy. It had all the amenities needed. For an excellent stay in the city x.
2017-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Ann,A great place to experience Potts Point. The flat was. comfortable and stylish. A great restaurant to one side of the front and a patisserie to the other. The bedroom looks out into the tree canopy. Noise no great problem.
2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Alexandra,"Great location, nice space for our group of 8. Full kitchen and four bedrooms each with double beds. Note the upstairs bathroom has only louvred doors (not entirely private when there are a load of people in the place) and the downstairs bathroom has the nicer shower, but is located in the utility room next to the washer and dryer. Jeremy was great in responding quickly to some very minor issues  such as burned-out light bulbs."
2017-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,7920463,Weichen,"it's been such a wonderful experience staying at Korad and Michelle's. They were very lovely so does their fluffy family member, Morpheus:)) 

It's a very clean and tidy homely place, very peaceful and quiet at night. The best part I loved is the view you have when you look out to the window from the room, it was AMAZING!!! It's the backyard but it's not just a backyard, it's a great piece of beauty whenever you look at it, so peaceful!!"
2018-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Chantelle,"Our first Air BnB did not disappoint. The apartment was clean & homely. It was in walking distance from the beach and restaurants in a quiet street. It was the perfect size for the amount of guests we had! 
It was hard to leave the place! "
2017-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Allison,"Paul’s space was cute, and the location could not have been more perfect. I was able to take the train(very safe and clean) to and from the airport and towards Bondi Junction. The walk to the harbor takes 20-30 minutes through the Botanical Gardens and was one of my favorite parts of the stay. Potts Point also has some lovely restaurants that I wish I was able to explore. Paul is so responsive and has some great advice for visitors to the area. Just one little watch out—don’t pack too much since there are two flights of stairs to climb."
2017-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Ferez,"Fantastic host, great communication and very attentive. Perfect central location! Clean and practical apartment."
2016-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,William,"Susan's place is perfect. The studio is very comfortable and private, and Susan was a great host. Location is great, just a short walk to the beach. Will definitely stay again!"
2018-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,5993432,Se Ho,"good location, clean rooms, kind host. Everything is perfect!"
2017-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,17967409,Shaun,What an absolute pleasure it has been staying with Helen and her husband (Mike). Helen and Mike had gone above and beyond to ensure I was both comfortable and felt at home. You could not ask for better hosts! My room and bed were comfortable and all other needs were met. Anyone looking to stay in and around the Hills District look no further! 5*****
2014-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Joanna,"Myself and two friends stayed at Simone's lovely home in Randwick for a little under a week.  The home was extremely neat and clean and she was kind enough to leave us a bottle of wine in the fridge too!  It was absolutely perfect for our needs during our trip since we had a car, it made transportation easy however, I saw many bus stops in the area.  We had a really fantastic time exploring Sydney and having Simone's home as our base.  It was a quiet and peaceful neighborhood and the home was really charming :)"
2017-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,1944996,Steve,Annie was very helpful throughout the stay. The apartment was comfortable. Easy walk into the city. Plenty of restaurants nearby

2018-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,22337456,Fangyi,It will be a pity to miss that apart. It has comfy and clean furniture and living environment. The host couple are approachable and nice. Highly recommend!

2017-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,9098095,Penny,"The train carriage was exactly the place I wanted for a relaxing weekend getaway. The accommodation was amazing in that it was quiet, uniquely designed and surrounded by nature. Margaret was very welcoming and baked us cakes which was delicious. Overall, it was a enjoyable stay and we're planning to go back."
2017-06-19T04:00:00.000Z,13299549,Daniel,"A bit noisy due to the George St road works and buskers that set up in the alley behind the accommodation, but it is an inner city apartment, so to be expected. "
2018-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Laura,"Great space, great location, what more could you want!"
2014-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Andrew,We had a lovely stay in Mags' Mosman apartment. It was exactly as the photos depict and absolutely spotless. The local area is residential with lots of lovely shops and cafés up on Military road. Balmoral beach was a 20 min walk away and circular quay a short ferry ride from south Mosman (the main Mosman ferry wharf was under re construction in September 2014 so was closed). Thanks Mags.
2016-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,10213499,Lisa,"Tracy is a great host, very accomodating and friendly! This place is amazing, your own one bedroom apartment, right across from Narrabeen lake and 10 minute walk to Narrabeen beach and shops. It has everything you need to stay in with a kitchenette, lounge area, heater and extra blankets, even wifi and foxtel! Thanks for having us, we really enjoyed your place. It's perfection :)"
2017-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Boxuan,Very good choice I made! So lovely!  Thanks a lot!
2018-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Jill,"Great location, beyond clean & a cosy place to stay.
Michele was such a great host, and was quick to help with anything.
Highly recommended!"
2016-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,9802077,Line,What a great first experience with Airbnb! The apartment was great and well cleaned. All communication with Helena was positive and fast. The Glebe area is great with lots of restaurant. I definitely recommend this place and I would stay again :)
2017-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,16166535,Kelly,"Such a lovely and charming home, you made our stay so comfortable, thank you!"
2018-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Kevin,Great location and comfortable and clean. Everything you would want for 2 couples or family.  Good kitchen facilities and loved the fact that here was ice in the freezer.  Host made us very welcome and looked after us well.
2018-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,26829659,Anne,"L'appartement est très bien. Le transport en commun est près mais pour aller en ville, il faut planifier environ 1 heure. Le Wifi n'est pas régulier et donc le signal est souvent faible.

The apartment was really fine. The commune transport took us an hour to go to the city and the wifi was not regular, but it’s quite usual in Australia.

In the end, it’s a REALLY good value and the host were easy to contact.
Thanks a lot!"
2016-09-13T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Peter,"Yes all very good. Bit far from shops. Large Woolworths ,10 min walk."

2018-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,794910,Cornelia,"Gavin is a very friendly, welcoming and helpful Host. His appartement is very central and is in the perfect area to explore the city by foot. I would really recommend staying in his appartement."
2018-03-19T04:00:00.000Z,15312988,Adam,Had a great stay with Cindy and Claudio. Highly recommend to anyone looking for somewhere in the Randwick/Coogee area.

Place looks even better in real life
Best Airbnb hosts I've ever had 
view is magical and house is perfectly equipped "
2016-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Ambre,Really Nice studio close to the city!
2017-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,16261574,David,Jennifer's apartment was very clean and has amazing views! I think it's one of the best airbnb apartments I've stayed in.
2017-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,8242333,Eleanor,The host canceled this reservation 125 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2015-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Zachary,"I'm so glad I booked this beautiful studio. It was clean, well stocked and quiet. Belinda's attention to detail was apparent as she supplies the studio with everything you'll need, with a nice collection of books, movies and music for you to enjoy, and even sensor lights that make sure you don't trip on a stone at night.

The studio is also a short walk to several beautiful beaches as well as the neighbourhood supermarket.

If you're going to Bundeena, this is the place to stay. "
2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,16087198,Kevin,"Lovely, warm and welcoming hosts. Very clean. The only downside was the window between my room and the bathroom. You can't see through but if someone is using the toilet at night, my room was bright. Great Neighbourhood, especially for Asian food :)."
2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,21939239,Mat,Always a pleasure to stay at Don's lovely apartment. It's a home away from home.
2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Aaseline Elizabeth,"The apartment was really nice, and the location was even better! It was clean, and there was all the essentials like soap, towels and sheets. The check in was easy and quick. We enjoyed our stay and can recommend it to others!"
2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,10416859,Leila,Leslie is such a warm lovely person who welcomed us readily and offered earlier check in to suit our needs and was beyond helpful. The space was perfect size cosy but not at all cramped and she went out of her way to make it easy and provide everything you could possibly need. Definitely worth a visit :)
2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,20206764,Pete,"Highly recommend, very comfortable space in walking proximity to beach, cafes and stones throw to city. Host was very accommodating and communication was very easy."
2017-05-22T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Jane,"We had a fantastic time, great location and easy walk to beaches and transport. A lovely basket of breakfast goodies was left at the door to enjoy. Highly recommended."
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Kim,"Susan’s studio is a wonderful space: stylish, sparkling clean, quiet, close to the beach and a very quick bus trip to Bondi Junction, and set within beautiful gardens. Susan added some thoughtful, unexpected extras, was very accommodating of our flight delay and provided excellent dining recommendations. We would happily stay again."
2017-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Ian,Great Location. Lovely place and superb hosts.
2016-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Taqi,The place is amazing.  Great location for morning walks. Very friendly neighbourhood. The house is very clean and the swimming pool is just way too relaxing. I honestly enjoyed my stay for 5 nights. The place is very spacious and I could not look for any place better than this.
2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,26474245,Anita,"Leigh's apartment is superbly located, close to the amazing Maloney's grocer and some fabulous restaurants and cafes but most importantly only a short walk to the amazing Coogee beach. The apartment is clean and comfortable, especially the beds! Quiet as it faces away from the street. We had a fantastic stay!"
2018-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,23222456,Mark,"房东是一个艺术家,我们交流的很开心｡"
2018-05-03T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Mae,"The view from this place is truly beautiful! The kitchen is well equipped. This place could be used just as easily for a long stay as it was for our shorter one. We were there for three days. Leslie was a very thoughtful host, leaving wine and chocolates in the fridge, and even brought by Band-Aids for me when I got a really bad blister from my new shoes. 

DOWNSIDES:
As mentioned in previous reviews, the basement holds moisture. As long as you keep using the de-humidifier, you’ll be okay. 

A major problem we had was Sydney’s inconsistent public transit, more specifically the buses. If you’re used to relying on transit, look for a place that is closer to the central parts of town. I think of all the buses we took, we had ONE arrive on time. Some showed up 10 minutes after the scheduled time, and one didn’t even show up at all. So, look for something nearer the main harbour or CBD, or you can do like we did a lot of the time: walk down to the Manly Wharf (about 25 min walk) and take the ferry to the main harbour, and only stick to the areas that are closest. Honestly, take the ferries as much as possible. The views are phenomenal. They absolutely -made- the trip for us!"
2018-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Mir,"Ali and Maryam. My wife and I can't thank you guys enough for the place. Your granny flat was beyond our expectations in many ways. It was very clean and the accessories in rooms, kitchen and bathroom were more than adequate. The furniture was very comfortable and everyone had a very warm and comfortable sleep. The price we paid was far less than what I would have been willing to pay. The layout of the granny flat was well thought through to guarantee full privacy. Definitely well recommended with no hesitation :) :)"
2018-08-28T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Ben,Lina’s place is easy to access and has all the things you need to look after the family while away. The flat is spacious and clean and communication with Lina is excellent. I will definitely use this space again when I’m in Penrith again.
2018-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Kelvin,"Clean and good location!! Comfortable place to stay at!
Value for money!"

2014-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Fabiano,"Even thought I barely met Naveen, Tris, her partner, was very kind and helpful showing me around their place and giving me advices about the neighborhood. The room has a great view, and their place was clean, organized and very well decorated. I really felt comfortable and well hosted. The location is also very nice with good restaurants, bars and cafes just around the corner. Would definitely go back if I had the chance."

1min from beach
Amazing view
Super sleek studio
Great kitchen & cooking facilities
Nice living area to hangout 
Extremely clean
Lovely toiletries (shampoo etc)
Secure parking
Great communication

Would recommend staying & I will definitely age my stay here again!
Thanks so much Anita, great apartment"
2017-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Jennifer,"Elizabeth Bay is a pretty and convenient location. Mariana’s flat is small but has everything one could need and has been recently redecorated. It was also surprisingly quiet. Some of the best restaurants in Sydney are nearby. If you like to run the Domain and Botanical Gardens are close, as is the Boy Charlton pool. Harbour beaches, Circular Quay, and the CBD are a bus or short train ride away. Highly recommended."
2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Lucia,Beautifully renovated Art Deco apartment in great location. Very clean. Would stay here again.
2015-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Pavane,"Arnie and Lorraine's Artists Home in Paddington is a true gem. Wonderful and warm hosts with a truly unique and interesting house in the best location in Sydney. They were kind and relaxed, the place was comfortable, you didn't want for anything and though I didn't have time on this trip you could easily spend some wonderful hours in the eclectic decor of the really fantastic bohemian style lounge. The surrounding area is teaming with cafes - The Bonython is literally next door - The Alimentari down the road and tonnes of great restaurants - a few minutes to Oxford St via William St - minutes form regular buses and taxis. Paddington is a great area of Sydney. Historically, culinary and fashion wise with a market on Saturday. Believe me - a fine way to experience Sydney as a visitor. If you are a solo traveler or a pair looking for old Artistic Sydney charm on a realistic budget then this is the place. Wish I could have got to know the hosts better. Can't wait to go back. Great people doing a great thing. "
2017-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Lyee,"First time staying at airbnb. I got off at the wrong bus stop, Shuang's parents fetched me to their home. The room is as showed. Cozy room. Comfy bed.
Walking distance to Sydney airport."

2015-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Nathan,"Staying with Rhonda was brilliant, I honestly couldn't have asked for more. She was always really welcoming and I felt really comfortable staying there. The room I stayed in was great, I had my own little area which I really appreciated. Everything felt really homely which I really liked. I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the south Sydney area."
2015-03-10T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Ruwani,"My husband & I spent an enjoyable 4 nights recently at this property which is well presented & spacious with self catering facilities. Our lovely hostess Bernadette presented us with a plate of yummy chocolate slice, juice, milk & fresh flowers. Excellent location with great views of the water. A short walk to the rock pools, bus stop (bus goes to Circular Quay every 1/2 hr) & the Beach cafe which serves reasonably priced delicious meals! "
2017-08-02T04:00:00.000Z,16964637,Vinay,"This house is shared house, host doesnt live here or I havnt met her during my stay of 6 days, only available through emails. Room was good but Shower was bit clogged n had hairs when asked to clean no answer. Same thing was with bed linen, was used before, host didnt change even when asked.  
Kichen was mess at times as it is shared house."
2014-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Sonia And Damien,"Staying with Susan and Greg was the perfect airbnb experience. They checked on us on our way in to Sydney to make sure we knew where to come, met us on arrival with maps and great local knowledge about the best things to do in Bronte and surrounds and provided a tranquil beautiful sanctuary with amazing provisions. We almost ran out of fridge space! :-) the garden is gorgeous and a beautiful place to sit and the bed was the best we've slept in since leaving home months ago. Greg and Susan even did our laundry for us! Way above and beyond ... All I have left to say is stop web searching and stay here. You wont find better. "
2018-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,17829178,Michelle,"Elise’s apartment was central and spacious and in combination with her prompt response, my family’s time in Sydney was wonderful. There was a slight hiccup with the cleaning when first checking in but Elise arranged for cleaning staff to come immediately and that matter was rectified. Would highly recommend her place!"

2015-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,9080393,Heri,Lina is a very warming host. She was there when we arriving and kindly showing to us the entire place. The house itself is very convenient for a family to stay couple of night. Very clean house! It's located in about an hour from CBD which is provide us with quiet environment. Nice place to stay.
2017-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Alex,"Great place and excellent position in the centre of Sydney.

2012-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Tanya,"David's house is really nice and the location is awesome. I strolled along the area and let myself getting lost in the city and exposed to so many cool areas in Sydney like the famous Oxford St, Hyde Park,  Surry Hills, Kings Cross and Victoria St.  
The bed in my bedroom is so comfy, I had a hard time every morning to leave the bed.  It is just too comfortable.  

I just love how David prepares all the helpful Sydney Guide and various board games he has in the guest room. 

Definitely a place to stay if you're after a nice and cozy place in Sydney.

2018-09-20T04:00:00.000Z,27716426,Akiya,I worried redfern is dangerous. But it is safety.
2018-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,1143151,Alma,Great opportunity to stay in a special part of Sydney in comfortable accommodation within reasonable distance of public transport and eating places.
2018-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Deanna,"Tracey’s apartment was a joy to stay in. It is a beautiful, sparking clean apartment, and is in an excellent location close to a big shopping centre. The checkin and out was so simple, and the thoughtful touches really bought the experience to a new level. I would recommend anyone to stay here !!"
2017-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Sanne,Craige & leonie have a lovely home which is located great at bondi beach.
2017-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,16087198,Celine,"Room as per listing. Good location with walking distance (10-15mins) to Eastwood centre and train station. Min's parent is so lovely and thoughtful. There's a day which I had bad headache and couldn't go out to grab food, Min's mother prepare me lunch and dinner on that day. Quiet and clean, easy check in, i'll come back for sure."
2018-04-21T04:00:00.000Z,23106836,Nicole,Loved our stay at Judy's place! She gave great advice on where to visit and her home is beautiful! We are hoping to come back one day!

A nice private space with EVERYTHING you could need for a stay in the Northern Beaches.
Cathy is EXTREMELY hospitable and took extra steps to make our stay wonderful."

2018-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,21999107,Joni,"This was the best air bnb I’ve ever stayed in! Book it and experience beautiful, relaxing Watson’s Bay! Neil and Jane were great hosts and our entire stay was exceptional! I’ve already recommended to family and friends and I’ll be looking to stay again in the near future. Thanks Neil and Jane!!"
2016-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Teresa,"Rhonda and Michael, Thank you very much for your hospitality. You made me feel welcome at your house."

2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Sarah,"View is amazing, location is perfect. Unfortunately it was very windy while we there and the windows rattled quite loudly. Also, neighbors decided to have a large party and noise went on until early in the morning."
2014-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Rachel,This is  the sort of place one wants to remain secret--but the joy of discovering it is too great not to share the surprise! Wonderful  tranquil surrounds coupled with loving attention to simple warm design that welcomes.  Perfect.
2016-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Debra,"What a find! Bronte B&B surpassed our expectations. It was relaxing, comfortable and had everything we wanted and more! Susan and Greg were delightful, giving us our own space but there when we needed anything. If we ever return to Sydney we will know where to stay!"
2018-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,22362742,Hary,Thanks for being a wonderful host. Great place and so central in the city. Eleni was so quick to respond to queries and made sure the stay was as enjoyable. Would happily stay again.
2018-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,22335017,Lamson,"An amazing man with a wonderful flat which is good location,  clean & tidy! I love to communicate with the owner who always have a lot of imagination."
2018-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,5923031,Tonya,"Great place, superb value! I highly recommend that you go visit the rooftop terrace of the place, as it's lovely up there and exposing yourself to the sunlight (with proper precautions like 50+ Australian Cancer Council sun cream, a broad-brimmed hat, and some water) will help you get over your jet lag. Having the washing machine and drying racks for laundry is especially helpful for the compact traveller who doesn't bring much but does have to wash clothing often enough. I also loved the little terrace off the condo unit, where I had my breakfast every day. So wonderful! Give it a go! It's a great listing!!"
2017-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,20374683,Tanner,"Great place, great host"

2016-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Don,A wonderful private cabin behind Susan's inner city cottage. Although I did not get much time to chat I found Susan a wonderful host and the cabin was exactly what i wanted for a few nights. Public transport to the city nearby and I was able to park in the street overnight. Recommended and I'd definitely book again.

2018-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Jennifer,I had a lovely stay at the Bondi Beach  Retreat at Craige and Leonie’s place.  Steps from everything and still only heard the birds chirping in the morning.  Very easy going and comfortable.
2018-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,23222456,Colin,Lovely cottage and amazingly lovely host. Would definitely stay there again. Thanks very much.
2017-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,James,"Much more than we expected, it was clean, tidy, and had everything we needed. The host was really kind and helpful, event after going trough any host's nightmare, a group of 20 year old that didn't leave on time and trashed the place. It doesn't have a kitchen, but you can easily prepare a meal, and eat at a 10 seat dinning table. We defenetly recommend to familys or any other kind of group! Thanks again"
2016-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Dan,"What an excellent stay! The views from the apartment are stunning and the location couldn't be more central. Really easy to get to from the airport and an excellent base for exploring Sydney. Great communication from Hugo before we arrived with areanging early check in and late depaeture, and during our stay when i managed to (temporarily) misplace the key card... thanks for your help Hugo and sorry for the inconvenience!"
2016-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Haley,"We loved our stay at Pamela and Hugo's. The apartment is in a great location, very close to several train stops and is a short walk to some of the best parts of the city. The apartment was spacious and clean, and had amazing views. Hugo was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to questions and was very accommodating and flexible in our arrival and departure. He even left us beer in the fridge! We would gladly stay here the next time we are in Sydney. "
2016-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Edmund,It was a great cosy place to leave at King Cross area. Train station was in walking distance. Area is close to plenty interesting cafes. Room is clean.
2017-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,10213499,Petra,"Tracy's little apartment is a lovely place to stay if you're looking for some peace and relaxation but also not far away from the hustle and bustle. We enjoyed walking and riding around to explore the lake, coffee shops and speciality stores. If you're around on a Friday pop over to the markets - you won't be disappointed."
2018-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,17797004,Liangjue,Room is clean and decent though not fancy. Fantastic location. I had to check out in the morning but Agnes kindly accommodated me to leave my luggage in the apartment until the evening as my flight out was late. Great communication.
2017-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,15745971,Rebekah,Super friendly and easygoing! Place was absolutely spotless and the apartment was lovely!
2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,5482864,Emily,Nice apartment and as it appears in photos. Flat was clean and conveniently located near bondi beach. Recommended!
2017-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,16020247,Angela,"This is a lovely house in a great location. Close to great restaurants and not far to the train station. Very quiet at night and very comfortable. Kassandra has lots of interesting artwork on the walls and it feels very homely. One thing to note is the stairs to the upper floor are very steep as they are in these kind of houses, could be difficult to navigate if you have mobility issues."
2015-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Debra,Our stay at this lovely cabin was made even more memorable by the hospitality of Michy and Paul. Clean and attractively decorated the cabin was very private and a perfect place to rest after a day of sightseeing around the fabulous Pittwater area. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable stay.
2017-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,15960997,Adam,Great location. Nice stay.
2018-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,22367184,Kerrie,Aimee & Dan's place is located in a vibrant part of the city. A walk or short bike or bus ride to many of the attractions on offer. Particularly good for attending any concert or sporting event at Alliance or Sydney Cricket ground.  The apartment is stylish providing all the comforts of home. The facilities are amazing with a gym and pool in the complex and many restaurants & cafes just downstairs. Thank you for sharing your home Aimee & Dan.

2016-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Diego & Iva,"Shuang is a very organised and helpful host. all our questions had been answered quickly and accurate before our arrival. the room was spacious and clean with all the needs for our short stay. 
the location is near the airport and took us about 25min to walk there with heavy backpacks - easy!

definitely recommend Shuang!"
2018-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,16183477,Marvin,"Unhappy experience with this room, because the room is not tidy and clean. Finally, I gave up to live in this room (Website hidden by Airbnb) Anyway, I hope the landlord  can clean room  carefully, and don’t let the following customers feel down. And Cecilia apologized about this experience for me"
2018-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Johannes,Five star host offering a great apartment with amazing views. Thank you Anita!
2018-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,19641701,Melody,The place is the same as shown in photos. Laura is very responsible and very responsive to messages.
2014-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Chelsie,Kerri was very nice and accommodating. Unfortunately I was unable to stay last omits but she was a pleasure to communicate with and will definitely be a place for next time! Thanks Kerri!
2018-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,9080393,Laura,Lina’s place is a little hidden gem of a granny flat which was perfect to stay at for our needs. It has everything and is very comfortable. Would stay again for sure
2017-04-23T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Nicolas,"We enjoyed our stay .
We wish we had more time to enjoy the pool.
Our request for a late checkout was accommodated.
Sarah was very helpful."

2018-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,18082902,Kellie,Great location close to Sydney uni and bus stop into the city. Place was very cosy and hosts were easy to communicate with. Would recommend Brock’s house =)

2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,James,"Michele was  very accommodating, all communication was quick and clear. The studio accommodation was super conveniently placed (Walking distance to Enmore Theatre/Newtown), immaculately clean and cosy. Lovely inclusions such as breakfast cereal, tea, coffee and milk. Would thoroughly recommend. Thank you again Michele."
2018-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Karyn,"This apartment is a wonderful place to stay in Sydney. It is very stylish and comfortable. The location is near transport, shops, cafes and restaurants. Having access to a kitchen also gave me the option of cooking a light meal if I didn't feel like going out."
2016-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,10416859,Jean-Gab,We spend  4 perfect days ! Helpfull and guestfull !  I recommande !
2018-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,8797439,Latimah,"We felt comfortable and at home the moment we walked in. It was perfect for our family of four! Tidy, clean, cosy and quality. And what topped it off was Kirsty’s caring contact and responses ensuring we had a great stay. 

Thank you."
2018-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Celina,"Natasa's place is conveniently located a minute away from Petersham station which makes it super easy to get around Sydney. Her house is quite cosy although it can be a bit cold during winter, but the blankets in the room are definitely enough to keep you warm at night. I only met Natasa on the last day of my trip as she was away but she was lovely, as were her housemates. Would definitely recommend!"
2014-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Hanna,Mags' Mosman apartment was lovely and had everything we needed. It was comfortable and cosy and quiet from city noise. It was within walking distance to a few little shops and takeaways.
2019-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,23650892,David,Location is amazing although a busy noisy street all night but hey your in the center of it all and it’s expected.
2017-08-09T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Adarsh,"Paul's place is centrally located and very close to the CBD area. If you're looking for a place to stay that's close to the center of the city, a stones throw away from the bus stops, close to a couple of restaurants and a place that says 'You are welcome to stay with us in our house, please make yourselves comfortable' then this is the place to be. Both Paul and Judith go the extra mile and help you get around the city with Opal cards and with suggestions on what you can probably do with your day. We had a lovely time staying at their place and certainly enjoyed their hospitality."
2018-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,14921505,Brent,Bailey’s place is exceptional and comfortably fits 14 people without feeling like you’re living on top of each other. There are spacious rooms on each floor and views from every level. We absolutely loved staying here and thoroughly recommend it to anyone.
2017-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Vanessa,Spectacular views! Gorgeous beach front cottage that is stylish and comfortable and very well equipped with all you need to make your stay a delight. Our kids loved the freedom of exploring on their own and the surrounding bushwalks and beaches were stunning.  Sleeping to the lull of the ocean was beautiful and the sun rises were incredible.  You feel a million miles away yet only a 10 min ferry ride from Palm Beach.  Such a great spot we cant wait to visit again.  Richard was a great host - communicative and responsive.
2018-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Cilic,Really nice apt. Convenient location for traveling to Sydney. Fantastic place.

2018-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Yvonne,"Mi evaluación es excelente, La ubicación es estratégica, a pocos metros de la bahia de Darling y de la zona de negocios Pitt street . Llegas caminando a la Opera en minutos .las vistas del departamento impresionante, el departamento está muy bien equipado 
La cama matrimonial no era la mas cómoda en la que he dormido pero fue lo suficiente para tener muy buen descanso."

2014-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Markus,"One of the most beautiful places I have been to. The house is lovely, in perfect location, quite and peaceful, very well maintained, just a flight of stairs down to the beach, stunning ocean view from the patio. The host Richard is very helpful. 100% recommendable."
2018-04-04T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Pavel,"Paul and Judith are the best hosts and the loveliest couple! Of course we enjoyed the private room at the loft, the comfortable bed, the private bathroom with hot shower, the kitchen and the lovely garden for meals and a beer - but not as much as the heartwarming hospitality by Paul, Judith and their 2 adorable dogs! Everything made us fell like home in Redfern, a lively yet peaceful neighbourhood with lots of wonderful eateries in Surry Hills. One not to be missed is Bourke Street Bakery. Coles supermarket is at doorsteps and Sydney CBD is easily accessible by bus in around 20min. No doubt we will choose to come back there whenever we visit Sydney again."
2015-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Michele,Thank you Arnie and Lorraine for letting me stay in your very interesting home. Also appreciate you accommodating me a such short notice. Will be back :) much appreciated Michele
2018-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,22268452,Dr. Hasan,Shaun is a very kind and helpful person. He is also very flexible in terms of check-in and check-out time if no one is coming to the room that day. The place in located just nearby Rose Bay Wharf and a ferry would take you to the central (near Harbour Bridge/Opera House) in 12 minutes. It was a good stay at Shaun's place. :-)
2018-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,25684995,Gemma,"We had a great stay, such a great location! Johannes was very helpful and a wonderful host."

2016-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Kellie,"This is a good spot if you want to be out of the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough to walk to it. The Air Con only goes down to 18 degrees celsius and mostly directs to the living room not the bed room so if you sleep hot be warned. 

Sweet place!"
2019-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,22124796,Edel,"The apartment is very comfortable, well maintained and supplied with all the basics in both kitchen and bathroom.  We really enjoyed the outside deck area for a morning coffee or evening cocktails! The building complex also offers a well equipped gym and swimming pool which was a great way to unwind after a busy day.  The location was excellent for both touring the historical Rocks area or enjoying the shops and restaurants of bustling Bangaroo.   We could not have picked a better location."
2018-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Chandler,"Great central location, a bit noisy at night but Jared is a good host and accommodated us :)

Thanks again!!"
2018-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Anisa,"Nice peaceful location, would recommend to someone looking to spend a lot of time doing outdoor activities and enjoying the area. The space is underneath the main house however privacy was not an issue."
2018-05-23T04:00:00.000Z,24460964,Elaine,"I had a lovely 7 night stay in this accommodation while visiting with my sister and friend. The location was perfect, a short walk from the centre and close to the train for other trips. The amenities in the apartment were all in working order and included a washer and dryer. The jacuzzi bath was particularly luxurious. We would definitely return. Max and Anton were the perfect hosts."
2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,2609433,Margaret,What Cecilia has created in the Inner West of Sydney is nothing short of amazing! The house is quite magical and the garden likewise with chooks and wonderful plants providing a restful experience after a long day of work. What a pity I was the last guest. Please look out for what Cecilia does next though. I have no doubt it will be onward and upward!
2014-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,2609433,Zazie,"A warm greeting by Cecilia and a gorgeous haven away from the hustle and bustle.  With possibly the comfiest bed around!  Thank you Cecilia, we will definitely book again!"

2015-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Claudia,"Es war unser erster Airbnb Aufenthalt: 
wir haben uns bei Cath sehr wohl gefühlt.
Das Garden Studio war für uns perfekt: es liegt zwar etwas außerhalb, es ist aber durch diverse Bus-  und S-Bahnlinien sehr gut an die Innenstadt angeschlossen. 
Das Studio war sehr sauber und ist sehr gut ausgestattet. 
Es gab eine Mappe mit wichtigen Infos über Einkaufsmöglichkeiten, Cafés und Restaurants in der Nähe, was sehr hilfreich war.
Cath war so nett und hat sogar auf meine Allergien ( Tierhaare, Nahrungsmittel etc.) Rücksicht genommen, was ich wirklich klasse fand. Es gab sogar extra nussfreie Kekse für mich. Toll!
Vielen Dank Cath für den schönen Aufenthalt bei Dir!"
2018-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,23510317,Maria,Even better than in photos! It feels very stylish and spacious but homely at the same time. It had everything we needed (it even has a walk-in wardrobe!). The hosts were very nice and attentive and the place is super well located (you can even walk to the Opera House like we did). Really recommended!!
2016-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Renee,"Susan's Bronte B&B is absolutely perfect! Susan and her husband were extremely welcoming and lovely people to have a chat with. Her room in Bronte is located at the end of their beautiful backyard, separate from their house and is precisely as described on Air BnB. The room is bright, spacious, super clean and has all the amenities that one could possibly need whilst away, with a big comfortable bed to boot! Susan had thought of everything for the room, from an iron, insect repellent to breakfast, a fruit bowl, tea, coffee (real coffee) and chocolate!! They are a short walk from cafes and restaurants and Bronte beach and a longer walk to Bondi. Highly recommended host! "
2015-10-04T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Annette,"Had a great stay with Kerry who is a wonderful host. The location is excellent, just a short walk to Stanmore or Petersham stations with quick trips to the city and airport. 
Kerry's home is very clean and well laid out with plenty of privacy and your own bathroom. A great video and book library, beautiful deck area for meals and just relaxing...what more could you need? 
Breakfast was laid out and Kerry even cooked me a meal on arrival and picked me up from my daughters place. A wonderful host, beautiful home..... I'll be back!   Thank you so much Kerry"
2013-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Benoit,Thanks for this first night in Sydney. The Bed is very comfortable and Hernan and Connie are very nice people.
2015-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,8277472,Hash,"I stayed with Elizabeth and Simon for around 2 weeks and it was like being at home. They are really nice people and treated me like a family. 

Elizabeth went out of her way to accommodate me and i still miss Simons cooking and spending time with me. 

I could not speak any more highly of them that i do and would definitely live with them if ever needed.  They are like family.

2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Marie,"Paul and Judith offered very helpful recommendations throughout our trip and gave us helpful tips for getting downtown, as well as finding great restaurants. The kitchen cart for guests was very convenient, with tea, coffee, chocolate, and muesli included, as well as use of a mini fridge and dishes. I especially enjoyed the muesli! Meals out in Sydney can be quite expensive, so it was nice to be able to prepare lunches in the morning and set out for the day. Paul and Judith’s is conveniently located near two grocery stores, several coffee shops, and numerous pubs and restaurants. It usually took us 30-45 minutes to walk to Hyde Park. We felt that the walk to and from downtown was manageable, though public transit is an option, too. Lastly, the room is very cozy with a wonderful down blanket that’s perfect for chilly, rainy nights. We loved our time in Redfern! Thank you both!"
2015-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Liz,"Paul was very friendly and helpful.  The apartment was lovely, very neat and clean with the added bonus of being located conveniently to public transport and amenities."

2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,12098138,Olivia,"Such a wonderful stay! Lizzy’s apartment is the best place to  stay in the Eastern Suburbs. Convenient, very clean, perfect for families and just above the beach! Last but not least, Lizzy is a great host, making sure we had all what we needed and very responsive. Thank you again for a wonderful stay!"

We had a wonderful week in your immaculate apartment with all the comforts of home and the added bonus of an abundance of natural light throughout each room!

2019-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,26829659,Kate,A nice homely unit. Close to everything you need in Olympic park.
2018-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Samm,The location for this listing was a godsend - it’s right smack in the middle of pretty much every iconic spot to visit in Sydney - so walking is always doable and Uber rides are short. The apartment itself is in great condition and comfortable and clean to live in. Sam is also a very responsive host and gets back with info fast.
2018-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,23357535,Laura,"Great apartment, just in the middle of everything! Really close to the main attractions of the city

Highly recomendable!!"
2019-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,4872526,Ben,Great place for a weekend away with great private views!
2017-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Caleb,"This little apartment is lovey inside, though the building it's in is a little creepy. Everything went smoothly, although this apartment is right on a busy street with many loud cars and people passing by at night. Other than that though, this is in a prime spot. Literally right in front of a BigBug tour stop if that's your thing."
2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,14886923,Caitlin,"This place was a great location if you want a simple place to sleep. The place overall was a bit run-down compared to the photos, but was the perfect location if you are interested in walking to the water such as Darling Harbour. Andrea was a very responsive host. Our only complaints were some bathroom bugs and hearing the elevator operating throughout the night since we were right next door."
2018-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Dave,Great spot and great apartment
2017-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,16160263,Diya,"Justine's place was great - the photos don't do it justice. Its super spacious, the balcony is brilliant and looks out to leafy bush, and is easy to get to even without a car."
2016-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Julie,Margaret and John were welcoming hosts. The train carriage was lovely with everything you need including quality linen and comfortable bed. The bush setting was a delight to wake up to with easy access bush walks. I would definitely recommend.
2017-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Robyn,A lovely home full of character and great for our family trip.

2018-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,21583732,Bohan,"Ellie’s place is as clean, reachable and well-equipped as you imagine. Living area is very nice with a lot of amenities making your stay enjoyable and easy. Private room is well-lit and spacious with much comfort. The house sits in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Shopping facilities and train station is just 5 mins walk away. City center is only 15 mins train ride, or you can go to Chatswood, the local Centre with huge shopping malls and fancy restaurants, which is just one stop away. This is an ideal place for both business and leisure travelers come to visit Sydney."

2017-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,13595339,Antonette,"Mariana is such a great host..welcomes and bids goodbye to her guest personally. She responds quickly and has created a comfortable & beautiful abode for guest. Her flat is close to Kings cross station, bus stops and hop on/off stop. Close to grocery, market, restaurants and bars...including ice cream shops :). Her apartment is very reflective of Sydney...its a combination of a sense of culture & vintage with the comforts of whats new & functional. I LOVE the fact that we come home to a very comfy bed and bath tub + epsom salt after a very tiring touristy walking day. :) "
2017-06-26T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Imogen,Heidi's house was absolutely perfect for our stay. Immaculately presented and with all the necessary amenities. Plenty of space too--excellent host!

2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,20962081,Summer,"Min was a very accommodating host. We were in Sydney for an appointment that ran longer than expected so our check in changed a few times and Min was very understanding. Any questions I had were answered quickly and the units location is very convenient. It is a 10 minute walk from Central station, across the road from World Square (restaurants, cafes and Coles), 5 minutes to Museum Station and China town is very close too. The unit was clean, having two bathrooms was very convenient, the massage chair is wonderful and there is a nice view from the balcony. The only suggestion I would have is some more pillows on the bed, but this is a personal preference. I would definitely look to stay here again while in Sydney."
2016-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Anwar,"The house is perfect for our stay. It's 10mins walking distance to UNSW and a few mins away from supermarket and eateries. The house and rooms are very clean and our stay made pleasant with the amenities provided in the house like washer and dryer, a big kitchen with a separate dining and living room.  "

It's like a fairy bower with a large mulberry tree and a small terrace for outdoor eating.  The accommodation is small but immaculate and stylish, with a terrific shower head, quite the largest we have ever seen.  All mod cons, even a hair straightener so we wanted for nothing.  Susan and Greg are the most charming and considerate hosts.  Their hospitality is outstanding as are the fabulous surroundings of Bronte Beach nearby.  We would return in a heartbeat."
2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,16029413,Leanne,"Bundeena Base was perfect for our family of 5 for a long weekend getaway. The wifi and Foxtel were hits with the kids, the pool was perfect after a walk or time at the beach, the air con on muggy summer nights was great too.

Okay here it is and I am gonna make it short .
The studio has got all the essentials you need which  is being mentioned in the house manual.
We just loved staying at the garden studio for almost two weeks .
I highly recommend this place for a peaceful and enjoyable stay.

The place is artistic and you can feel a designer touch in the house. The hot water run well and the kitchen is fully equipped.
The kings cross train station is just around the corner makes you travel easily around the city. Special appreciation to the shopkeeper inside the station that help us buying our first opal card.
Special thanks to the cleaner that enthusiastic welcome us and help with the trash bin."

We rent a car for two days and that was very convenient with no trouble to find parking spot. Highly recommend and definitely will return in the future. Give mine appreciation for hosting a great place.

2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,22323221,Meg-An,"Agata was very responsive and provided all info we needed about access to / getting settled into the unit both ahead of our stay and during it.

The unit was basic however had everything we needed for our trip to Sydney, since we didn’t spend a lot of time at the unit. We had clean towels and sheets provided, and the bathroom had everything we needed. 
It was clean but it was an older unit, which I think people can sometimes mistake for dirty (based on previous reviews I read).

We were able to park our car on one half of the shared driveway, being sure to leave the other half of the driveway for Agata and her family to access their garage + home (which backs into to the unit and the garage provides their access to their home). There was also street parking though. We had a brief interaction with Agata and her family by chance as we were heading out one day, which was very pleasant. Agata was very kind and hospitable, however was sure not to be a presence during our stay.

Since our stay fell on a warm time of the year, it did get quite hot inside in the afternoon and evening. There is no air con, just a pedestal fan which was in the bedroom. Which could be moved about if you needed it in the lounge room. However I feel in summer it would get super hot inside.

Our two dogs felt right at home there - there is a good outdoor space perfect for dogs (secure gate and fences, small grass patches with trees, and a large secure deck area).  There is also a park about a 10 minute walk away from the unit which was great!!

Thank you for welcoming us and our two dogs into your home Agata. We had a great trip and appreciated the convenient location & solid base for our time in Sydney."
2014-06-01T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Kim,"We were very happy with our stay at Garden Cabin. It was nice and private, located in the rear garden. The cabin is within walking distance to great cafes in the very cosmopolitan Norton St area and we found it very easy to visit the city via the Light Rail which is located nearby. Susan is very friendly and helped us willingly with our travel needs. There was a very generous selection available for breakfast and the bed was comfy. The flights overhead were a bit noisy the day we were there, but we expected that after reading other reviews. We would be very happy to stay with Susan again."
2018-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Joanna,"It was a great place to stay for an early flight! Excellent value for money, and lovely place."

2018-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,27932125,El,"Imogen’s place is just perfect. In the heart of Bondi, it’s close to everything you need. It’s light and sun-filled, and spotlessly clean. She is incredibly gracious, with on-the-money local’s recommendations. The bathroom was gorgeous. The whole place was beyond relaxing. Loved, too, having such a big space to myself - the room is lovely and oversized, with a desk and a massive mirror. Wish I could live there!"
2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Emily,"Cat's house was great - exactly as described, awesome location close to everything! The house was clean, and the space worked really well - especially since we had 3 kids with us, who were able to spread out and play without getting under our feet! Cat was a very accomodating host, great communication and we felt really comfortable. The little extra touches like extra blankets and towels, and lovely soaps / shampoos in the bathrooms just topped it off! I would highly recommend staying at Cat's place. "
2016-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Stuart,"The house was great. Very roomy considering there are just 2 proper bedrooms.  The decor was beautiful, the place was clean and the beds were very comfy. Plenty of crockery and cutlery, and lots of bath towels. Good location for reaching city and the Northern Beaches. It was a pleasure staying there."
2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Alex And Madeline,"This was a wonderful place to make our temporary home in Sydney. Only downside is we were only able to stay a few nights - wish we could have stayed longer.

The location is incredibly convenient to the Sydney museum, airport (short taxi ride or train ride), local eateries and bars, and sightseeing bus stops. Check-in was a breeze, as we were met by Matthew despite having a late arrival. He showed us where everything was located, and was friendly and welcoming.

Inside, the apartment is filled with amenities and welcoming touches that made us feel right at home. It's very clean and well-decorated. 

We would agree with other reviewers that said the stairs are a bit steep and narrow. It was absolutely no problem for us to navigate, but I would not recommend it for the elderly or those with disabilities, as there are no bedrooms on the entry floor.

Overall, 5-star place that we would absolutely choose again."
2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Rob,"If you are looking for a place for five or six people to stay in Sydney, this is the perfect accommodation. Very well furnished, three bedrooms and bath. More than enough room for diner and relax. Fully equiped with special attention at arrival. Perfect location nearby city, bus and train. Also parking for one car available."
2017-05-24T04:00:00.000Z,9802077,John,"I had a great stay at Helenas apartment. Helena was a great host and very quick to respond whenever I had any questions. The apartment was very clean upon arrival (and the complimentary fruits and drinks was a nice touch!) and has all the things you need to have a comfortable stay. I think the one thing I missed was a drier to dry my clothes/sheets/etc. in after washing them, but that didn't become a problem either since you can easily dry the clothes on the balcony or indoors. The apartment is situated in a nice and quite area in Glebe, and within walking distance to bus stops, shops and restaurants, the harbour and so on. I can truly recommend Helenas apartment for single travelers or couples looking for a nice apartment for longer or shorter stays in Glebe/Sydney."

Susan is a great host.  She was awesome about letting us drop our bags off early, and even offered to help, if our daughter who is studying abroad for a semester  in Sydney, needed anything.  Highly recommended."

2018-08-16T04:00:00.000Z,26340840,Stella,"This house is very nice especially suitable for family with young kids. Our kids love the trampoline very much. We love the outdoor living space, this area is excellent and out of our expectation. We enjoyed staying there for meal and entertainment. It is very good to have a heater there, very comfortable! The spa in the outdoor area is also good for us to relax. The location is convenient , only a few minutes walk to take ferry. Everything is true as they described. 
Only thing was that the dishwasher was out of order and reported on the second day of our stay. Although we were kept inform that they were trying to fix it, it was not fixed at the end of our nine days stay. It was quite inconvenient for us as we cooked everyday and we have 8 people to dine. 
Anyway would recommend."
2017-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Abhishek,"Lovely appartment, very close to Darling harbour (walkable-5 mins). Appartment is well equipped and spacious. Appartment building is not that well kept, however once you are in the appartment you won't feel that."
2016-05-04T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,永贵,"Thank you for giving us such a warm house. Although getting along with two days, we feelt your warm and careful. You provide us with the site and the train route made us to the Sydney opera house easily. When we booked room difficulties, and help us to solve the problem. Thank you again, wish you have a long career.
感谢你为我们提供了如此温馨的房屋｡ 我们相处虽然两天,但感到了你的热情和细致｡你为我们提供的火车站点和路线让我们顺利到了悉尼歌剧院｡当我们订房间困难时,又帮助我们解决了问题｡再次感谢,祝你事业顺利｡"
2017-05-18T04:00:00.000Z,16827551,Sonia,"Second week in Sydney for business, and enjoyed staying in this lovely home. The neighbourhood is just gorgeous and a calming respite after a busy day!"
2018-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Hazel,Lovely clean and comfortable place. Close to transport and very well equipped.
2014-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,Joe,This was a great location next to the beach with plenty of room for a family of four and a great view of the beach.  Mal was very responsive and provided restaurant recommendations.  We enjoyed our stay on Bondi Beach!
2018-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,22362742,Patricia,"Well located, well decorated and well equipped, a very good option to stay in Sydney. A few things could be improved on the cleaning side but sure that Eleni as a great host she is will take care of it."
2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,16261574,Michael,My wife had a nice stay here.....great views. Host was a little hard to contact re checkin but otherwise all good
2018-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Martin,"This was our first Airbnb experience and I choose it first on the location close to Palm Beach and also the price when scrolling through. The scroll through price was $110 p/n but there were extras of $35 for cleaning and a $22.15 service fee. These may well be standard Airbnb extras but on a one night stay I guess the cleaning fee to cost of stay ratio seemed a bit high. I knew the total fee before finalising the booking but I guess I would have liked the pricing better if it was all inclusive at $165 and not the $110 plus, plus .... one good flip side is when I shared a screenshot of where we were staying and a few commented that it seemed like great value at $110. The place is very nice and neat. We arrived at night and the host had left the garage lights on so we could see along the narrow path to the shack at the back. Later the lights were off and getting another load from the car was tricky although a flashlight was left on the kitchen table for this purpose. We never met the host but that was maybe due to our late arrival ...but I’m also ok with this as I’m a bit shy and I knew we could contact them easily if needed. It’s an awesome spot very close to a nice dock and a little beach as well as a swimming area. Well recommended!"
2016-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Pip,"Great apartment, super spacious, and in a great location. Definitely recommend Nicole & Simon's apartment. They were quick to reply with any questions and provided everything we needed for our stay."
2014-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Justin,"Louise's place is fantastically airy and inviting, with big open windows that view out onto the Sydney skyline. The space was plenty big for my girlfriend and I for 4 weeks after we relocated our lives from London to Sydney. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare meals and everything is of top notch quality (we even bought the same kettle after using the one in Louise's kitchen!). The bedroom has the most comfortable bed ever and tons of wardrobe space to store your stuff. Massive TV in the lounge room and the dining table allowed us to work during the day and have full meals of an evening. Buses to the city are right out on Alison Rd and it only takes 20 min to be in the heart of Sydney. Quiet neighbourhood, close to shops in Kensington and a short drive from Randwick/Waterloo for more shopping. Centennial Park across the road is great for weekend walks too."
2018-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,13595339,Anne,"Cosey little apartment, so close to anything you want or need!! For a little space it has everything, incredibly well done - could have slept in the dream bed all weekend and not gone out and been happy!! All it’s missing is a view but you step outside and your in the heart of Potts Point - perfect!!"
2016-04-10T04:00:00.000Z,4499095,Laura,"We really enjoyed our stay in Dino's beautiful apartment in Elizabeth Bay and it was very difficult to leave. Dino is a great host and communication is prompt and easy. The apartment is well situated close to great cafes, restaurants, lovely parks and stunning views of the Bay's along the many wonderful walks we enjoyed and not far from the many wonderful sights and venues that Sydney has to offer. We are very fussy with our bedding and Dino's bed is extremely comfortable. I recommend Lizzies next door for fresh delicious food if you want to eat in and Fratelli Paradiso on Challis Ave for great coffee. Our stay at Dino's lovely apartment was wonderful and we hope we will be able to visit again.  We have also enjoyed a stay in Dino's apartment in Lucca Italy last year, both places are beautifully styled (a testament to Dino's good taste and flare for design).  We thank you Dino for allowing us to stay in both places and your apartment in Elizabeth Bay was wonderful."
2018-04-20T04:00:00.000Z,7439246,Tracey,"The whole family loved our beach holiday at Nathans place - it is literally only steps away to the beach!  If you prefer ocean baths to the beach, these are only a short walk away as well. The apartment is not large, however it is very well set up to maximise the space available. Nathan was great to communicate with, and provided lots of suggestions about places to eat and things to see.  We loved El Tora Pizza and Tapa for dinner and Crazy Rays for a morning coffee.  Parking on the street was not difficult -  even on busy days it on took 5 minutes to find a spot.  We are looking forward to visiting again."
2018-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,19238057,Tina,"Daniel heeft ons erg gastvrij ontvangen. De kamer is ruim en het bed is erg goed, ook voor lange mensen. Het station is op loopafstand en met de trein ben je in een half uurtje in hartje Sydney. Met een auto ben je snel in de natuurgebieden rondom de stad.
De badkamer en keuken hadden iets schoner gemogen, maar dat kwam misschien omdat Elena er niet was en Daniel erg veel moest werken."
2018-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,20767798,Laura,Great location and excellent communication with host.
2017-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,21637487,Andrea,Kasey was a fantastic host with great communication. Her apartment is beautiful with so many cozy touches. Her place is right in the heart of Bondi with everything you need right outside the door!
2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,29240750,Shuan,Great!
2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Elena,"Paul’s place was beautiful and in the perfect location and up until early check in things were perfect. Unfortunately he kept quiet about the fact that earth moving works were performed right in front our window Mon-Fri 7:30am4:00pm. The house was shaking and you could not understand your own words.
He gave us one night free, but we would have appreciated honesty instead. It was not a relaxing stay."
2019-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,2900140,Helen,Welcoming hosts who are very thoughtful.
2015-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,1229797,John,The reservation was canceled 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Maryjane,"From the first email to Nicole, it felt like I was talking to a friend. She was so welcoming and helpful, and responded quickly to every request. On arrival I was met at the elevator with a big smile and the key. My surprise when I walked in the door was immense! The apartment is beautifully appointed, fresh spotless linen, a bowl of fruit, chocolates, and even an array of teabags and biscuits to have with my coffee. Such a lovely surprise. It's a spacious apartment with two beautiful bathrooms and amazing views. Even a large balcony with deck chairs. This apartment truly had everything we needed. There was a chemist near the ground floor doors, and a convenience store as well; coffee shops and cafes are nearby, and an excellent DFO shopping centre nearby (within walking distance; 1.3km I think).  I recommend this apartment to you without hesitation. Thanks Nicole! We'll be back!"
2016-09-18T04:00:00.000Z,6170899,Elaine,"Had a wonderful long weekend at Balmain Cottage. Jennifer was very welcoming and left us breakfast, wine and chocolates. The cottage is beautiful, clean and the beds very comfortable.
There's only a five minute walk to Balmain village with many great restaurants to choose from.
Would highly recommend. "
2018-03-12T04:00:00.000Z,20578419,Chad,Good communication although cancelled stay
2018-03-12T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Heather,Clean apartment in a quiet street
2018-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,19508741,Nathan,Hassle-free and homely touches. We had a great stay and our only regret is not staying longer!
2017-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Juho,"The house is an old house in both good and bad, but we found it very comfortable and kids just loved having a garden to play in. Windows and balcony doors are a bit leaky, especially on stormy weather, but putting a piece of paper between the window will do the job. Public transportation was much better than expected, with M30 getting us fast to any place near the CBD. There are many grocery stores to pick from, and plenty of other small shops too. The square next to Mosman Council is quite lively on both mornings and evenings. Could've definitely stayed here longer!"
2016-04-26T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Ghassan,Evelyn is a great host. I look forward to spending time once again at her little getaway .
2019-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,17829178,Kesiena,"Great location, clean, modern and fully equipped"

2018-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,23650892,Raymond,"Naveen's place is in an amazing location, and was great value for money. She was communicative and very helpful."
2017-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,11778959,Jiaojie,house is so so so…lovely and Jason and his wife are friendly!
2017-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,15920870,Luke,Oliver's place is spot on.  It's easy to see why he receives such great reviews. Would recommend & will stay with Oliver again for sure.
2016-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,13320545,Bec And Sam,"It was lovely to meet Jessica, she was an amazing host! The apartment was clean and comfortable. The location was great, with Paddington's amazing restaurants and shops just on our doorstep. Jessica was very friendly and helpful and we're definitely planning on staying here again next time we're in Sydney!"
2017-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,17797004,Richard,"Agnes is a very well travelled, polite and informative host. Excellent all round Airbnb expert."
2018-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,6046461,Chris,"This is a lovely stylish apartment. Great location near cafes, bars theater and transport connections. Suzie is a great host. One of the joys of airbnb is meeting interesting people like Suzie."

2017-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Debbie,"A really good spot, close to Potts Point nightlife with excellent transport links to the rest of Sydney. Well furnished with a nice kitchen too."
2018-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,16813942,Rohena,"You have a beautiful place, Cheryl, with excellent finishing touches. We loved staying here and loved the round window. Easy walking to the beach, cafes, tennis, Aboriginal rock engravings, local cluba and IGA. Very relaxing  We look forward to coming again!"
2017-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Mai,Olympic park apt has a nice view and has a quiet surrounding with some eateries just below the apt. Would recommend to people who prefers to stay away from the busy city.  Overall experience is good.
2015-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Gregory,"This apartment/room is a great place to stay in Sydney for the solo traveler or for couples.  It's a 5 min walk from the Kings Cross subway station.  The neighborhood has a bunch of great bars and restaurants.  It's centrally located and you can easily walk to many parts of the city.  If you are a light sleeper (I am not) then the street noise could be a bit bothersome on a Friday or Saturday night because the windows are single-paned (I did not have any problems with the street noise), but otherwise the accommodations are exactly as described and shown.  Comfortable bed, private bathroom, workout room and pool on the same floor.  Staying at this place felt like staying at a nice hotel in many ways.  Naveen and Tristan's wifi signal is strong and fast.  They provide soap, tea and fresh towels in your room should you need those things.  You can come and go as you please and Naveen and Tristan are a wonderful couple and excellent hosts.  They are easy to talk to and they offered many good suggestions about restaurants, bars, and sites to see (thank you for the Lil' Darling and ferry to Manly Beach recommendations!).  Naveen even graciously invited me to dinner with her friends; who were just as enjoyable to talk to as N & T.  And for dog lovers, little Felix will warm your heart.  I would absolutely recommend this room to a friend or any person looking to stay in the heart of Sydney with three wonderful and interesting hosts.        "
2016-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Cole,"Was a lovely bedroom we stayed down stairs the room was spacious but the only downfall was we could hear every1s foot steps from upstairs. The Hosts were both really helpful to my early check in and check out. Both bathrooms were great, overall we would definitely stay here again"
2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Ashley,Shuangs place was very nice. A bit of noise from the people in the room next to us and the beds. But extremely close to the airport and would recommend! Thanks!
2015-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,1789833,Menaka,"Steve and Jessie's beautiful Bondi home is emblematic of what Airbnb is all about: experiencing a location through the lens and comfort of a local. Clean, spacious, and comfortable, their house felt like home within minutes of arriving. They even left us a Sydney guidebook and a fridge with all the essentials! The location is excellent - near lots of shops and restaurants, and just a 10-minute walk from the beach. Even their neighbors were friendly, popping by to make sure we had everything we needed. We had a truly magical time in Sydney, much of which we attribute to our amazing accommodations. Thank you Jessie and Steve!"
2018-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,22297561,Hemant,Excellent value for money.. cant get anything else at this price.
2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,21127680,Carolyn,Coffee's place is extremely clean and looks just like the photos! She is an amazing host that communicates quickly and efficiently. The check-in process was very simple and quick. Her apartment is in an ideal spot within the CBD and i highly recommend staying at her place for short/ long stays!
2019-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,18130053,Rebecca,"Everything was neat and tidy. I liked the airy style of the loft a lot. Close to the city, close to the airport, trainstation nearby. A lot of working process in this area, it is not silent there! Keep this in mind. But after all, it’s a great apartment and Evan is a perfect host. Would like to stay here again if I am ever been to Sydney again :)"
2017-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,19599721,Princy,The location can't be better. Bus/train stations are within walking distance and Coles is literally 10 meters away. Huys families were very friendly. Private bathroom was definitely a big bonus for this price!
2017-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Melanie,"Perfect location. Few minutes walk to Darling Harbour where Madam Tassaud, Sea Life and Safari is located. Sydney Tower is just around the corner. Loads of shopping places."

2017-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Matthew,"From first contact through to departure, this was one of the best AirBnB experiences I've had.

Narelle was warm and welcoming with all communication & went above & beyond for a request I had on our check out day - which both myself & my friend (travelling with me) very much appreciated.

The apartment was in a fantastic location within walking distance of everywhere in Newtown & in very close proximity to public transport.
It was also very clean, extremely well-maintained & cozy - just perfect for our visit to Sydney. 

Thank you Narelle for being such a welcoming host - we really enjoyed this visit to Sydney even more so because of this wonderful accommodation & we'll definitely look this apartment up again for our next visit.

All the best,
Matt"
2018-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Ruth,Rhonda is a welcoming host. You’ll feel at home in a comfortable space in anyvery pleasant neighbourhood

The place is small, modern and cozy apartment with excellent location, also you can always find a free car park for two hours on the street.
I highly recommend it.

Kind regards,

2018-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Elfaine,"This space is surely value for money and the check in process is smooth. Sarah is kind to cook up the eggs for us as I overlooked as there’s no kitchen. :) We are also well informed about the roaches and was given pesticides too. The room can fit our family of 6+1 but it can be a little squeezy and stuffy at night. The pool was a great addition too, my Niece and Husband enjoyed it. Cheers"
2014-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Naama,"We really enjoyed staying here. Great location, the room has all that we needed, including great shower and beds. 

Susan is lovely, helped us a lot in any kind of information we needed. 

Would surely have came back there next time we in Sydney (but afraid it will be in few years at least...)"
2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,20578419,Ikram,Great place to stay with close to all amenities.
2016-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Lucy,Philip was very flexible about check-in and check-out arrangements. He could not have been more accommodating & friendly. The property was great although the stairs would be an issue for children and anyone with mobility problems. A fantastic location with all the sights & great shopping easily accessible on foot. We found the train link direct from the airport & nearby Museum station an added advantage. Would stay here again & recommend to anyone staying in Sydney. So great to be able to get a load of washing done before moving on as well!
2013-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Janice,"The Garden Studio was wonderful. It had everything we needed (and more!) and it is a beautiful space. Cath has thought of everything, from a change of towels mid-week to shampoo, cereal choices, and even a homemade loaf of bread for our 6-night stay. We felt truly spoilt. Marrickville is being hailed as the ""new Surry Hills"" and at the number of quality cafes and food stores nearby was just astounding. We rented a car, and we were really happy with the easy (and free) parking on the street too."
2018-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,12117514,Nina,"great location,  walking distance to everything near Bondi. Excellent restaurants and drinks very close to apt."
2017-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,MarieClare,"This accommodation is just great for a night in the city or if you just need somewhere to sleep after sightseeing and dining out. Close to transport, dining and shopping areas"
2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Ebony,"What an extraordinary home! I had a delightful stay in the green room. Arnie and Lorraine were everything you would want from hosts - welcoming, friendly and inclusive and happy to leave you to it also. I highly recommend their home plus it is in a great location, easy to get to the beach and city."
2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,22412815,Noriko,The children enjoyed it with a wide deck.
2017-10-16T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Robin,"This is a great studio guest house. It is exactly as pictured. Susan and her husband were great hosts. The help arrange my early arrival and very early departure (booking a taxi for me). You really have a private space and gardens which makes for a nice quiet stay. I appreciate the espresso machine and coffee packs, also the milk, yogurt, juice, fruits, berries and granola. I would definitely stay again. It is in walking distance to great restaurant and coffee shops, and Bronte Beach."
2015-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,David,"Paul's place is very nice, well situated near all the shops, restaurants, sites and bay on Macleay street. Easy to get to from the airport. Good bed and kitchen, nice cooking facilities. Thanks again Paul.
David"
2014-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Jessie,"We headed to Great Mackeral for a spontaneous weekend away.  The beach house is idyllic - the location is spectacular, and the house is perfect.  Beachy, comfortable and has everything you need!    

We swam, lazed and read on the deck lounges, played Jenga, Uno & Scrabble, and cooked up an absolute feast in the well equipped kitchen.  Aside from all that the house has to offer, we also explored a little further afield with trail runs and bush walks in the surrounding areas.  

We also loved the remote feel of the location - we basically had the beach to ourselves, but it took us just under an hour to get there from Sydney, including the very quick ferry ride. 

We have all returned to the city refreshed, and vowing to get back here as soon as we can.  Richard and Claudia were very responsive, and provided clear instructions on all logistics involved.  

Thank you! "
2018-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Pablo,"Perfect location, beautiful house. Highly recommend this place! Very close to the beach and main streets and the house has everything you would need and more. The garden is beautiful and it even has a BBQ. We enjoyed it very much."

The open, airy feeling of the place was more than a photo could capture. It was quiet and serene. We slept well and enjoyed the peaceful environment. Avalon is a quaint town with much to offer in dining and shopping. Evelyn was very helpful in recommending lovely dining experiences, including a splurge at Jonah's Whale Beach. Go there, even if only to have a drink and take in the view! We will definitely rebook with Evelyn, as it was a perfect getaway."

The house was perfect  - we had family from Brisbane and Darwin for a very special and rare Christmas and New Year.
The location was perfect, nice and close to beach, an easy walk to movies and local shopping centre.

PS: The ocean views from balcony are stunning, and there is nothing better than lying in bed listening to the sounds of the ocean.

Once again - thanks so much - Julie and Terry "

Jennifer is very friendly, charming and she prepared many flesh foods for us, introduced us the information about supermarkets, restaurants and transportation. During our stay, we embarked on a ferry and enjoyed the landscape in the harbor district, then returned to the tranquil Balmain Village, which has become our important memory of Sydney."
2018-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,13333143,Colbi,"This place is amazing in Manly. I have friends who live in the area and commented about how central this place was. Ziggy was great with check-in, the apartment itself was super nice and clean. I told Ziggy, the only thing is the pull out mattress is uncomfortable so if staying with more than 2 people, you might need a mattress pad. He said he was going to look into it. It really is a beautiful spot. Would stay again."

2016-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Henry,"The most amazing host and home I have ever had the pleasure of visiting! We used Heidis lovely home for a film shoot and could not have found a more idillic location. 
The entire crew wanted throughout the day to jump in the pool and go for a swim it was that inviting.
Heidi is also the perfect host, nothing is too hard or can't be done, she even sourced another dining room table for us!

I would recommend Heidi and hour home to anyone who would listen. Now I want to go back and stay there with my family!"

2014-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,1321603,Fanou,"Upon disembarking the adorable wooden ferry on Dangar Island, the charm of the island operates… boat shacks and pontoons line the shore, houses hide away among the luxuriant greenery… We are met by wonderful Ann at the cafe, and while she takes us to the house telling us all about the island, we already feel looked after and start winding down. The heritage house, very well loved by the owners, is all at once comfortable/cosy, charming and full of wonders… some delicious like: fresh herbs, lemon/orange trees growing in the garden. The'Platypus"" bedroom with its timber walls, vintage lacy mosquito net, clean bed linen & soft towels, made us feel very snug. Ann had even placed some fresh lavender stems on our pillows! We explored the island during the day, hanged at the beach… It felt like the time had stopped for a while. Then, coming back to the house, we were welcomed at night by Ann cooking up a FEAST, literally. She put so much thoughts into the menu and what would please us! The dinner with Ann and her husband was lovely and very much fun. Needless to say that we slept like babies. The next day morning brunch was another delicious meal served on the sunny balcony overlooking the vegetation and the river. We left shortly after and felt we could have stayed for a few more days of true pampering!"

Parking is not straightforward. Recommend to check on the details with the host prior to arrival."

I hope I can visit the house again.
这座房子座落在一个很有历史感的安静的街区,附近都是维多利亚式建筑,建议对于澳洲近代历史感兴趣的人士前往入住,你可以看到房主的收藏以及日常使用的设施(例如家具或水龙头)都体现了近代澳洲殷实之家的生活特色｡买点小酒,饮品和甜品在这房子的餐室､泳池边或者套房里的阳台消磨几小时都是不错的选择"

Above all, Tim was very kind. 
If I visit Sydney again, I want to stay here."
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,17829178,Emily,Elise’s home is very close to the cutest eateries and not far from the main city at all. Couldn’t have chosen a better place to stay for New Years!
2018-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,2711936,Markell,My stay at Karen's place went according to plan. Super A+ host and would gladly come back again!
2019-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Carmel,"We had a great stay at Michele’s place. The location was in a quiet area but just a couple of minutes walk to the centre of Newtown, which was lively and full of restaurants and bars. It was very easy to get in and out of the centre of Sydney on the train. The studio itself was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend staying here!"
2013-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,888107,Alexandre,"Nous avons passé nos 2 premières nuits à Sydney chez Wyatt, et nous ne le regrettons pas ! Discret et disponible, Wyatt respecte très bien les valeurs du Bed and Breakfast. Il a de plus été précieux dans ses conseils sur Sydney, les endroits à découvrir, ou sortir, les balades à faire, les bon restaurants etc... On peut dire que Wyatt a été notre guide touristique pendant notre séjour !

L'appartement est au pied des transports en commun, et tout proche des commerces. La chambre et l'appartement sont très agréables, et la petite terrasse donnant sur le jardin donne un coté rustique à cette maison de Sydney.

Vous le constaterez par vous même, on est très bien chez Wyatt !"
2015-08-04T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Frank,"Michy made as very welcome,the property was as we expected.
Every thing we needed was proved ( so clean ).
Location was great and Michy told us about great walks near by.
Although it may be classed as a back yard cabin it was cute comfortable and furnished with a romantic feel"
2017-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Nadia,"Staying in this beautiful train carriage is one of the nicest Airbnb experiences I've ever had. Everything was delightful - from the wonderfully preserved vintage interiors, to the thoughtful modern upgrades, to the beautiful bush setting. Best of all was the kindness of the hosts - Margaret not only came to pick me up from the station, but also stocked the train carriage with simple, delicious supplies (sourdough bread, tomatoes, eggs, fresh basil etc) so I could make my own meals in the tiny kitchen. Other highlights include the hammock/day-bed which was perfect for reading in the sun, and the three gorgeous dogs who were endlessly playful and amusing. I would recommend this place to railway enthusiasts, vintage lovers, and anyone who wants to immerse themselves in nature. I hope to stay in this beautiful place again! "
2017-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,16029413,Aletta,"Bundeena base is a very special place, with it's pool and easy access to three different beaches. Hilde is clearly experienced from the hotel industry, and a very professional host, with an eye for detail, like the bathrobes and the welcome package. We felt so at home in this clean and impeccable apartment, we thought we might never want to leave."
2015-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Michael,A beautiful studio set in a gorgeous garden with all the little thoughtful touches needed to make a truly special stay. Thank you again.
2016-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,8277472,Kim,"I spent a wonderful week at this great apartment in Glebe in the heart of Sydney.  The apartment is very clean and tidy, very spacious and the host's niece made me very welcome. My large room had an extremely comfortable double bed and I slept soundly every night. There was plenty of storage and wardrobe space to hang my clothes. I had my own bathroom with a walk in shower that was amazingly hot and powerful.  There is WiFi throughout, a kitchen for cooking meals and a lovely lounge area to relax in and watch TV. The apartment itself is situated just off Glebe Point Road with at least 3 buses running directly to the city centre and beaches. Get an Opal card and use the buses which stop at the end of the road. The apartment was really quiet with no outside noise. The hosts were in contact throughout if I needed help or advice and provided travel books and handy tourist information that I used to get about. I loved the location best of all and would recommend walking three blocks down to the waters edge where there is a beautiful park  that is a hidden gem."
2015-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Lisa,Perfect location! Mal's cafe and dining suggestions are spot on !
2017-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,19599721,Gopal,"Huy's place is one of the best Airbnb experience I have had. The location is central, the host is super friendly, and the kids are adorable. I would highly recommend this place."

2014-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Susan,"Bernadette, Fred and Bilbo were great hosts, very welcoming and very helpful to try and make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  Malabar is quiet with almost a village atmosphere and the house is beautifully situated close to the beach, ocean pool, golf club and the beach cafe.  The accommodation was clean, comfortable and easy to access.  We very much enjoyed our stay and Bilbo (the dog) definitely won my daughter's hearts!  Thanks Bernadette and Fred!"
2018-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,19270950,Jay,"Host was very attentive, quick and helpful with responses. Amenities were great and easy to access. Kitchen was underwhelming and fairly empty (cups, plates etc.). Overall a good and cost efficient stay."
2019-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Natalie,"I agree with positive things that were written in other reviews about the location, view from balcony (I was happy to see a friendly colorful bird visit), nice host with good communication skills and the wifi connection.  I also feel the bathroom should be remodeled."
2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,21999107,Thomas,"This is an absolutely fantastic airbnb destination. The hosts are fantastic. The location is perfect. The actual apartment is REALLY nice  (much better than the photos let on) and spacious. 

We will definately be coming back. Neil & Jane are the best. "
2018-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,23106836,Erin,"The host is very helpful with directions for getting to the city, and is very flexible with check in time."
2014-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Ryan,"This definitely falls into the 'must stay' category! Not only was the room and accommodation well above expectations, but the neighborhood is great and very good for walking around to enjoy everything including the opera house, botanical gardens, and great restaurants. Naveen and Tristan were perfect hosts and it was a real treat talking to them and sharing in a great dinner Naveen made. "
2017-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Lachy,Can't go wrong here
2018-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,15960997,Jermaine,"This was my first trip to Australia and I must say I couldn’t have asked for better hosts and location. 

Check in was seamless as I arrived early in the morning on Easter Sunday. 

They gave me tips on transportation and how to get around in the neighborhood. 

The room has a nice view of the park and bay across the street. 

They both are very easy to chat with and very open to answer any questions you may have. 

For being so far away from home, it definitely felt like a home away from home."
2018-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Jessica,Great accommodation. Everything was clean and tidy. Shuang communicated well and the check in instructions were very clear and easy to follow. It was very easy to get to from the airport. I highly recommend and would stay again.
2018-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,Ricarda,"Highly recommended 11/10. Great location, comfortable and clean property with gracious hosts. One of our many highlights would be enjoying the spectacular sunsets overlooking the pool and bay while bbq’ing fresh fish and enjoying a glass of wine while our kids played in the garden. We hope to return soon!"
2014-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Gill,"Flying in from interstate, Marcella was flexible with arrival and departure times. House was very clean and in ideal location for beach and cafes. Felt very welcome with tea, coffee, cereal, milk etc.  Marcella supplied beach towels for us all on request.  All 9 of us really enjoyed our stay and would loved to have stayed much longer."
2017-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Cameron,Very serviceable accomodation. Great area.
2018-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,22068048,Glenn,I just keep on coming back. Always a pleasure to stay. My favourite home away from home.
2018-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,8121226,Andre,"Just stayed there for 3 months! Had a really great time, the apartment has everything you need Jenny and Simon are just great! They helped me on everything I needed! This is the place to go, for sure!"
2014-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Chris,"Mags's apartment was spacious, tidy, and beautifully presented. Everything you need is there. Check-in & check-out & dealing with Mags was easy.

Location is perfect. The street is lovely & great for walking around. Breakfast place & shops just around the corner. Balmoral beach is a 30min. walk. 

I would stay here again & would highly recommend it to anyone."
2019-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Hocheol,"다음날 일찍 비행기를 타야 해서 공항 근처에 하룻동안 예약한 숙소였는데 가격은 제가 묵었던 다른 에어비앤비와 비교해 조금 높았지만 그만큼 값어치를 하는 숙소였어요! 공항까지 캐리어 들고 걷는건 좀 부담스러워서 기차로 이동했는데 아침 9시 비행기여서 6시 남짓에 이동했음에도 불구하고 공항까지 가는 기차가 운행해서 너무 좋았구요! 주로 중국인들이 많이 거주하는 아파트 지역에 위치한 조용한 주택인데 집 자체도 너무 예쁘고 에어비앤비용 숙소도 정말 깨끗하고 잘 관리해놓으신것 같아 편안하게 묵을 수 있었습니다! 제가 묵은 에어비앤비중에 방도 가장 넓고 시설도 정말 좋았어요. 방, 화장실, 공용공간 등 모든게 완벽하게 구비되어 있었고 콘센트, 샤워기, 냉장고, TV까지 사소한것들을 잘 제공해주신 것 또한 큰 배려심을 느꼈습니다. 시내까지 접근하기는 조금 부적당한 위치이지만 공항 근처에 숙소 잡으실 일이 있으면 꼭 이 곳을 추천드립니다!!

Perfect location to approach Airport and it was a best place between my Airbnbs in Sydney. All furnitures were well-prepared and clean. I think the host is always very careful about his airbnb. Highly recommended!"
2014-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Luka,Hands down one of the nicest places i've ever stayed in. Beautifully perched up on the hill it gives an amazing view out to pittwater & across to palm beach. The interior is chic & understated with a perfect combination of beach retreat & stylish home. The house is nestled in the bush with frangipani trees everywhere & plenty of ample space to relax or entertain guests. I'll be back for sure!
2016-10-17T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Rodrigo,fantastic place. thanks so much
2016-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Elsa,"We had a fantastic time at luke and paul's. The apartment is very clean and well located, in a very vibrant area a short walk away from the rocks. It's stylish but cozy, it felt like being at home!"
2015-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,4158278,Alicia,"Emma is a wonderful host. The house and area were great - a perfect place to stay for a family. Upon arrival, Emma welcomed us into her home and made sure that we had everything we needed. After a very long flight from Europe, we were grateful and soon found (with three children) that we couldn't have made a better choice. 
The house was very comfortable. Whilst we had a car, it would have all worked fairly well without one too. Having had several airbnb experiences to date, this by far was one of the best!"
2017-06-16T04:00:00.000Z,7920463,Anna,Thank you for hosting me for yet another week :-)
2016-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Fischer,"This was our first airBNB booking, so we weren't really sure what to expect. We were very pleased. The room was good. Craige made us very welcome and explained the setup very well. "
2017-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,20578419,Beatrice,Great location and value! Much recommended to everyone traveling in Sydney. Max is a great host.
2018-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,16166535,Audrey,"Fei夫妻俩非常的好客,准备了早餐的食材给我们,新鲜的水果任吃,厨房的用具和调料都很齐,方便我们自己做早餐,晚餐｡而且房子的位置也不错哦,步行几分钟就能到达petersham train station,出行也很方便｡但因为我们在悉尼的时间太赶了,所以没能好好的参观Fei的大房子!的确是很特别的一次入住体验!"
2017-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Martin,Great little apartment. Super convenient.
2014-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,781631,Umberto,"Staying with Mike is like staying with an old friend, very easy to communicate and to live with. It is the first time I share a place with somebody and it was very pleasant, thanks to Mike. Actually he is never home, you will miss him! Great location, very easy to reach the city or the train station in Kings Cross. Highly recommended."
2019-01-12T05:00:00.000Z,16549021,Nadine,Great house and location really close to the beach and walking distance to the shops and cafes. Rob was a great host.
2018-10-17T04:00:00.000Z,22068048,Shane,"You can expect a modern comfortable apartment under the hosts home. The apartment is in a quiet street in leafy Mt Colah.
Well supplied with linen, utensils and cutlery. 
The hosts are always available but are happy to leave guests alone if that’s your preference."

2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,24460520,Phoebe,Great studio apartment in central location near public transport in Sydney. Sparkling clean on arrival and thoughtful touches.
2015-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Claire,"Me and my boyfriend stayed for 3 nights in the Bronte studio and absolutely loved it! The self-contained studio is at the back of the main house in the beautiful garden and Susan has really thought of everything you could possibly need. Susan and Greg were lovely hosts with lots of helpful advice and information about the local area (we loved Clovelly Bowls Club situated on top of a cliff where you can visit as a guest for a few very reasonably priced drinks). The neighbourhood is beautiful, with some nice local eateries where we had one of the best (and cheapest) steaks we've ever had at Eugene's! Bronte beach is only a 10 minute walk away, and other beaches (including Bondi) can be reached via a gorgeous coastal walkway. Sydney city centre is easily accessible via the local bus stop at the end of the street. We would love to return and stay with Susan and Greg again, and cannot recommend their beautiful studio enough! Thanks again :). "

2017-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,13320545,榛嫈,"1.房間無對外窗有點悶熱,跟房東借電風扇有所改善,但夏季可能會非常熱
2.有天窗可以引進自然光,因此白天光線很好,當然也不可能睡太晚｡
3.因為直接睡在房東原本的房間,因此房東會睡在客廳的沙發,所謂會提供的洗衣機等配備都不方便使用,連晚上上廁所都要擔心吵到房東｡
4.wifi連線很順暢
5.住宿的幾天附近都有人在施工,因此有點吵｡
6.餐廳有貓飼料等,因此有蠻明顯的貓味道｡
7.距離paddington Saturday market很近
8.房間衣櫃不能使用,且空間小,行李箱一打開就沒有空間可行走
9.有蟑螂"
2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Nestor,"Great place. Great host. Place was clean and spot on with its description. Great communication with Jennifer. It was my first time to use AirBnb, got lots of questions and Jennifer was always there to assist. A+++++++!!!!"

2018-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Jarrod,Simones place was very well maintained and clean. It was perfect for our young family and the kids loved the place. Simones place was so close to the local shops and beach which made staying there very convenient.
2016-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,13689460,Kathy,Very helpful and warm-hearted hosts. Very good journey in Sydney with the perfect accommodation they have provided.
2018-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Dana,Great if you don’t like the city but still want to be super close to shops and things to do. As mentioned you can hear some footsteps from the home above however Sam and everyone that lived there were courteous and there was no extreme noise or anything like that. I’d stay again!
2018-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Max,Great location and is a short walk to North Avalon Beach. The space itself was exquisite and everything catered for. Angela is an amazing host and very accomodating. We would not hesitate staying again or recommending to our friends

2015-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Warren,"Perfect place to explore Bundeena! Belinda met us on arrival to give us the run down of the place, which was  pleasant, private and fully equipped for a weekend away. Minutes walk from the beach, we were able to easily explore the aboriginal rock carvings. The local IGA was open till 8pm every night for our food needs too."
2016-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,2900140,Marie-Anne,"Wow! Talk about a super host... It only begins to describe Andi's hospitality.

From the minute I arrived she made me feel like I belonged. The apartment has everything you would ever need plus plus plus!

A 2 minute walk to the beach... 5 minute walk to some fabulous cafes and restaurants... you couldn't get more central.

The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in and the pillows were great!  I could just have easily stayed in bed all weekend if the weather wasn't so lovely.

I will definitely be back!"
2018-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,26934151,John,Nice place. Great host. Terrific location. Near what remains of Sydney nightlife as well as great places to dine out and breakfast.
2013-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,794910,German,"Gavin's apartment is located in the heart of the city, not far from the Central station, at the same time the street is very quiet and peaceful.
The apartment is very clean, well-organized and balanced. We had a feeling that we were at our own home (also we cannot forget the incredibly delicious ice cream - Gavin certainly knows the simple pleasures of life and doesn't mind sharing them with the guests).
The guest bedroom is quite spacious and comfortable, with pillows of 2 different heights to choose from (not a frequent option in B&Bs).
Gavin is a nice person, and knows a lot about his country and city. His travel suggestions for our further trip in Australia have helped us a lot.
Very good place, excellent host.

2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,19574869,Junhyeok,"The bathroom and toilet are all dirty and the carpet smells old. The house was old as a whole and the rusty tables and chairs were seen first.
Our family arrived at this place and booked another place in 5 minutes. It's too low a quality for the price."

The accomodation was perfect, so close to the main streets of Newtown and public transport whilst also being secluded enough that I was able to relax and wind down during the night. The room had everything I could have asked for and even felt like my own little hotel suite. Michele was nothing but accomodating throughout my entire stay and I'd definitely recommend staying here to anybody thinking about it. "

2017-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,9701620,Elizabeth,This is a fantastic place to stay! There was lots of room and it has a fantastic location. The view from the balcony is also fabulous and a perfect place to hang out on a warm night.
2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Nicole,Victoria's apartment is in a great location. We enjoyed the Saturday market followed by a nice walk to the Royal Botanic Gardens and harbor.  Dinner downstairs at Billy Kwong was delicious. Victoria is quick to respond to questions and provides helpful suggestions for exploring the neighborhood.
2016-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Johnny,"Loved the place! Amazing location! Had a lovely time here, and Philip was a great host. "
2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,16964637,Sevgi,The apartment was very clean and the Organisation between the other guests was good. The location it’s a little bit to far from the CBD. The train station was out of order for the time and we should take all the time the bus. The station for the bus was close to the apartment.
2017-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Chou,"很不错的小房间,干净整洁,不小心反锁了,房东夜里过来给我开门,很感动"
2018-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,23510317,Harleen,Listing as described. Walking distance to public transport and some really nice restaurants.
2017-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,8121226,Carolina,"Jenny's apartment is the perfect place to have everything you need while getting to know Sydney. It is close to public transport which makes everything easier, but it is also close to the city so if your in the mood to walk it would be perfect! Communication was great and Jenny is a very nice host! Made my stay really good. "
2018-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Wendy,"had a great stay t Pauls apartment. Very close to the Corso and the Wharf.  very clean, plenty of towels, pillows etc    great seperate lounge room  very quiet street and just perfect for a week away in Manly"
2016-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Michael,"Kath was a great host, everything was well prepared when we arrived."
2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,21999107,Dylan,Clean stylish place in a great location. Neil was an excellent host throughout  the stay. I will definitely be back. Thanks Neil.
2018-05-21T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Po Cheung Dalen,Clean and really stylish places! Wendy is being so helpful through out our journey with quick response!
2017-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Julio,"Amazing house, it has everything you need and a great location."
2018-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,David,"Great location, near to Rail station and with plenty of shops and cafes.    The shared area in the block is very dilapidated, but Paul’s apartment is stylish and well appointed.   Arrangements for arrival were perfect.   Yes, the road is a little noisy, but it didn’t stop me sleeping.   The flat had everything I needed for a week in Sydney.  Thank you."
2018-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Cas & Jenny,"We enjoyed our four night stay, thanks to Pamela and Hugo, having everything we needed and of course we loved the great views and location. Check-in was easy due to Hugo’s clear instructions. Yes there’s some traffic noise being mid-city but earplugs at night helped and it didn’t worry us much at all. We would stay again. Highly recommended."
2017-10-17T04:00:00.000Z,10091713,Mingyu,"This place is pretty awesome. It is pretty close to anything you would really need. Within about a 1.5 mile radius (35 min walk) we could really get to any part of town of interest, and anything else uber is always convenient. The place is small and cozy, nothing more you need for your stay. The TV is a smart TV with the youtube app which (we didnt realize till after staying in our other airbnb's without it) was awesome! 

The only thing is, the bed and the couch kind of sunk in. So we ended up sleeping on the ground. Which honestly isnt bad at all, and made my back feel muuuch better the next day. Honestly didnt detract from the experience at all."
2015-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,5224098,Ian,"Thank you Tam, Your room was just as described, I flew in Early and responded right away to my sms about the key location and he made it a hassle free situation. 
Great location for my needs this time in Sydney, walking distance to various neighbourhoods and the city, I didn't need to get one cab in the 3 days there. 
Thanks for a hassle free stay, will look you up again on my next business trip to Sydney. 
"
2017-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,9849915,Fabienne,"This house is fantastic, run to it!!"
2016-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,9098095,Paul,"This is a gem, and we will most definitely return in future. Not the cheapest accomodation by a long shot, but considering the class and character of the reconditioned railway carriage (actually suprisingly spacious, except for the kitchenette), the beautiful forest location - its a good deal. Margaret and her husband is a friendly and engaging couple, provided quality breakfast ingredients and just took great care of us. We particularly enjoyed inviting 9 people over and entertaining them at the pavillion !"
2016-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Jiaying,"i really enjoyed 4 nights in Sydney and in Hugo's apt! Fantastic view through window that we can see sea and Hyde Park and Sydney Tower. Hugo is very kind who answered our message even in the evening. The apt has a really good location, 200m from Town Hall, 100m from Woolworths and Chemist Warehouse, just in the very Sydney CBD. We walked to anywhere. Thank you Hugo and if I have another journey to Sydney, I will first choose your comfortable apt to sleep."
2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,21939239,Mat,"As always, a great stay at Don's beautiful apartment."
2015-12-23T05:00:00.000Z,4164487,Christian,Amelia and myself had a lovely stay with Duncan and Ashlee. Their place is conveniently located 1 bus stop away from Sydney CBD. They were both welcoming and accommodating and we would definitely recommend  them to future guests.
2016-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,13193079,Megan,"I was thoroughly disappointed in this apartment, on arrival we were told we had been moved to a different room. 
The Room we received had no view, no oven, no dryer, the bathroom was disgusting and had to be cleaned by us on arrival.
The walls were covered in marks, we paid for a queen bed, sofa bed and a single bed, however we recieved a double and two singles. 
The Room key didn't even have the correct room number on it, the fridge had milk stains and none of the cutlery matched..
The wine in the room was a nice touch and it was in a great location.."
2017-09-03T04:00:00.000Z,19376053,Blanca,Andrew's apartment is very nice and close to everything!

2016-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Holly,"Belinda and her husband were both very kind and helpful, they were informative but gave us space and privacy too. The property was clean, well equipped with quality towels and linen, kitchen had everything we needed (BBQ was great) and had a nice little supply of pantry items. It was perfect for a relaxing getaway! Had a fantastic time many thanks :) "
2017-09-12T04:00:00.000Z,15960997,Rosy,Staying with Terry was really quite nice. I stayed 12 days and I highly recommend it. The location is really nice. There's a park nearby and it isn't hard to get to any places. The building is a high rise apartment and the view is really nice - as is the comfortable bed and bathroom to yourself. Terry is flexible with check-ins and helped me with my luggage. I loved it!
2018-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Vivian,Paul was very helpful and response my questions quickly. His apartment is clean and tidy. We had good time at his place.
2015-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Eva,"We had a wonderful time at Susan's. She was really welcoming. It was one of our best AirBNB experiences so far. The included breakfast is a hit, always fresh fruits, nuts and cereals. We would definitely recommend Susan. "
2017-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Beverly,"Mohit was a wonderful host.  Met us personally to show us the place and give us the key.  Everything was great, and close to the airport which is what we were looking for.  A couple of good places to eat within walking distance was perfect for our one night stay. "
2017-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,19238057,Blandine,"We really enjoyed our stay at Daniel & Elena 's ! the house is really great, with everything you could need, the room is perfect and the bathroom as well ! Close to the train station to the city and the airport
We really recommend this place"
2016-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,6201263,Jia,Comfortable and lovely home. Flexible time to check in and out.
2018-05-16T04:00:00.000Z,9802077,Yann,Very tidy apartment in one of the suburbs of Sydney. I will come back!

2017-07-14T04:00:00.000Z,2838442,Dale,A lovely clean place to stay with a wonderful host.
2016-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,6785160,Alix,Carole and her husband are welcoming and have a plethora of knowledge about Sydney that they are eager to share with their guests! The bedroom is comfy and that bathroom is luxurious. Highly recommended.
2013-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Jessica,"From the first contact with Wayne and Kate my first experience using AirBNB has been fabulous! Their regular and thoughtful communication was perfect and we were so excited to stay at their beautiful apartment overlooking Tamarama Beach. We arrived to find cold bubbles in the fridge, a block of chocolate and a 'house and area manual' to assist use with everything we needed to know during our stay. The apartment was perfect! Great size for a larger group and it was so nice to have the home comforts right at our fingertips. I cannot recommend this experience enough and look forward to staying at Wayne and Kate's apartment again in the near future! "
2018-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Josephine,Great bolt hole in the inner west. We'd stay again.
2019-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,26829659,K.J.,"Great location, very clean, good check in. Thx b much"
2013-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,927923,Brian,"We stayed here for several weeks during a gap between leases. This is a lovely quiet apartment situated close to public transport (buses and ferries) connecting you to the city. The apartment was clean and spacious with all mod cons available. Julia was excellent to deal with, and was very responsive to any queries that we had.

I'd recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay in Sydney."
2017-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,5581269,Jean-Claude,"le logement est parfait,très propre bien situé dans un très beau quartier. Paul était là pour nous accueillir et repondre à  nos questions .Une petite plaque de cuisson serait un plus pour cuisiner ."
2017-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,16221015,Nicola,"Omio is so awesome! His place is super modern with great view of all of downtown Sydney. The location at Bondi Junction was so convenient to get to so many fun things to do, and he recommended stuff to do that was more of local areas, not just the touristy stuff. I loved the flexibility in checking in, as it was easy to work with him when arriving at our 6am flight, and he even made us coffee and offered us beer! By far one of our favorite places we've ever stayed :)"
2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,16166535,Joel,"Staying at the mansion was really interesting.  It is like it says, a historic mansion in the heart of Petersham.  The building has lots of strange quirks that are reflective of it's history.  Fei and his family and guests were hospitable and really made their house available to us."
2018-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,15889399,Louis,"A great little place in a great location. Didn’t see the hosts much as was out exploring all day, but they were most helpful on check in and through email. The welcome from the cats was an added bonus. I would say that if the plane noise would really be an issue for you, this isn’t ideal, but thanks to the accurate description we went into this well aware of it and it wasn’t bothersome. 

Overall, a great stay in a lovely cabin in a very convenient location."
2017-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,19238057,Johnny,"Great , very Nice people , all shop in padstow , 30 minutes to cbd"

2018-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,18917022,Andrea,"Could not ask for a better location. Right on the water, cafe next door, parking and 10 minute walk to Manly Corso and ferry. 
Rod’s hospitality was fabulous. The room itself is nothing flash, but great value for money and has everything you need. 
Will definitely be back!"
2017-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Alison,Great place! Beautiful apartment and close to most things (walking distance & close to public transport). Victoria was very helpful and friendly!
2019-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,31318633,Anne Marie,"Andy's place is really lovely, check-in was simple and is a good proximity to Sydney CBD an as well as some lovely bay walks. Housemates are super welcoming and the kitchen is equipped with basic necessities to cook in the kitchen. The room is a little bit warm in the summer due to being on the top floor but Andy has provided a fan. The room was very clean and spacious with comfy pillows and nice bedding. Highly recommend!"
2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,20865085,Monique,"Awesome apartment, location and host. Can’t recommend highly enough, and we will definitely be back. The home has been furnished with much love and the extra touches are so appreciated and go above and beyond

2016-11-07T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Bob,"I didn't meet Natasa but she sent me comprehensive messages about her house & how to access it, my room and the other guests.  As a result my stay went smoothly and comfortably.

The guest room in which I stayed was large & comfortable, with a large window that made the room bright & airy.  There was some aircraft noise but not sufficient to disturb me.

The other rooms of the house that I used, the bathroom & kitchen, were also comfortable with appliances working smoothly.

The house is conveniently located close to the railway station, with a pub opposite & a good cafe 5 minutes walk around the block.

I would heartily recommend Natasa's house."
2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Rachel,"Susan’s garden studio was lovely and spacious with a good size bathroom. Susan was friendly and helpful and really went the extra mile to make our stay pleasant. Excellent transport links into Sydney city centre, very easy to get in and out of the centre."
2017-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Keyang,Louise is such a nice host. She answered my every single question patiently and gave us thorough instructions. She's really thoughtful and she prepares everything that you can think of in the house.
2017-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,20865085,Kim,Best host! So lovely! And the house was perfect and very close to the beach ...

2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,15332652,Martin,Super charming little house mere steps from Redfern Sta. Lilian and her housemates are great hosts who made me feel very welcome. Highly recommended.
2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Gail,Shuang’s place is very convenient for international travellers as it is only a casual 20 minute walk to the Sydney International terminal and an easy walk from Wolli Creek train station with our luggage to get to .There were food shops close and we would definitely stay again when travelling overseas.
2018-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,22346270,Angela,Lovely clean and well presented accommodation. Not quite as private as the pictures depict. Children running in courtyard outside bedroom. Lack of air conditioning in Sydney summer heat was a big negative. A very large house fully booked made it quite noisy.
2018-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,18620288,Marek,"Great location and facilities, short walk everywhere. Lift a bonus. Would stay again"
2017-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Jet,Nice and clean!

Very polite and respectful."

2018-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,17438054,Monique,Beautiful and modern decor and we felt very at home. We loved how personalised they made they experience (instead of just stating 'dear guest') and suggested local cafes and restaurants to try. Great location with public transport a short distance away.
2017-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Rebecca,"Nicole's place was wonderful - we were in Sydney for a conference and coming home to the apartment was perfect! Comfortable, clean, modern, spacious & a great view! Will definitely be staying here again :)"

2018-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Karina,Evelyn’s apartment - in addition to having its own pool and incredible view - is a short walk from a gentle and quiet sea pool and an organic cafe. We spent a lovely few days in a very picturesque location...
2017-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Elizabeth,"The stay at David’s Place was perfect.  David met us on the street and stored our luggage before check in because we arrived early before check in time.  He also briefed us on the apartment and how to get around the area, and gave us the keys.  We had lunch right across the street while we waited for check in.  His apartment couldn’t have been more enjoyable, and convenient."
2016-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,David,"Sabrina was responsive to our questions and very helpful when we met; tea, coffee and milk had been made available on our arrival which was a really nice touch
We arrived by car and they have a private parking bay underneath the apartments which was invaluable and made things so easy 
This is a great location and the description of the apartment and amenities are very accurate and of high quality and we could not fault anything
When next in Sydney I will look to see if this apartment is available as a first choice
"
2018-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,24460964,Quang,Good Location. Fair price. Full of amenities and facilities. The place is clean and well furnished with style. Check in and check out is easy. Would definitely stay here again for next Sydney trip

2017-01-31T05:00:00.000Z,6046461,Mitul,"Suzie was a great host and she gave great advice on a quick tour around the local area on my arrival. Although she went to work on the day I was leaving she managed to accommodate a reasonable check-out time for which I was grateful for. 

The apartment is exactly as shown in the pictures. There are a number of ornaments, paintings, books etc which add character to the place. The bed was comfortable and spacious with plenty of closet space. Although not an en-suite the private toilet/shower was also very clean and large with toiletries provided. There is a decent balcony area and large lounge/dining section, though I spent most of my time in my room so cannot really comment on this. As mentioned elsewhere, the bedroom is close to a busy highway and so traffic can be heard when the window is left open, and also a little noise can be heard at night when the window is shut...but I managed to sleep through this without an issue.

The apartment is in Darling Harbour and a few minutes from the ferry stop which can be used to get good views of the Harbour Bridge/Opera House. There are many restaurants/bars/clubs a short walk from the apartment and the main city centre where all the shops are is about a 10-15 minute walk away. After visiting Sydney I personally thought that Darling Harbour was the best location to stay in and would not hesitate to recommend  Suzie's apartment to anyone!

2019-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,13333143,Sarah,"We had a wonderful stay at Ziggy’s place! Everything was spotless and Ziggy has thought of everything.

The bed was super comfortable, the appliances and furnishings were modern and every other mod con was accounted for - even a blender <3 

We already knew the pool and hot tub weren’t the star of the show, but that’s a-okay, because you are a stone’s throw from the refreshing and exciting Manly Beach!

We were really sad to be leaving and hope to be back soon"
2018-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Bridgette,"Clean place. Great location, very near to airport. It was exactly what I needed for my stay. Host communicated well and I found a street parking spot almost immediately."

2018-06-08T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Carolyn,"This cosy unit is suitable for 2 people, 3 at a pinch. It is clean, comfortable and close to Circular Quay.
We didn't cook in the kitchen, only prepared cereal for b'fast, and made tea and coffee.
Being winter, we made use of the convection heater when we returned from an evening outing.
The bed was very comfortable,  and the bathroom quite modern and sufficient. "

Being close to public transport & in a quiet location it was perfect, the space was super nice and modern but above all clean and accurate to the photos. I couldn't recommend it more highly :)"
2016-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,6046461,Brittany,"Suzie's apartment was a great stay! Everything was clean and the bed was comfortable. There is some noise at night from the road but it wasn't a problem for me. She has ear plugs if you are noise sensitive. Her place is a great location to explore the city by foot, ferry, or bus. Suzie was a reliable communicator and even let me check in early due to my flight arriving in the morning. She was very knowledgable about the area and answered any questions I had. "

2016-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,12370710,Melissa,This place is a gem. Maria is super friendly and generous with her time and pantry supplies. The water really is that close!! The location spectacular to look at and snorkel or just chill out with a coffee on the walkway. The room is very spacious and the window seat just makes you want to connect with your inner cat. We had an amazing time and can't wait to plan another trip to Sydney.
2018-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,25977467,Chiranth,"We had an extremely comfortable stay at Jared’s. The hip apartment is spacious for 2 and we particularly liked the pull-out sofa that became a comfy day bed after a long day of walking around. The area is right across CBD, well connected but still pretty quiet. Great bedding in the master room and overall super clean and well-maintained, with all amenities provided. Gabbie, our point of contact, was always reachable and very helpful and friendly. It was all the little touches like a personal note, a coffee machine, indoor plants and soft rugs that made it a homely experience. Thank you!"
2019-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Hannah,"Wonderful place! Very clean and comfortable. Easy communication and check in. The amenities were very thoughtful. Grateful for a hairdryer! And lovely breakfast :)

2015-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Sarah,"The unit was very easy to find in a lovely part of Mosman. Mags gave great instructions, always got back to us very quickly answering any questions that we had. Her place was true to the photos, it was very cute, clean and tidy and felt quite secluded. It was exactly what we were after and everything we needed was provided. We were in Mosman attending a  wedding at Gunners Barracks, so we were very close to the venue. The unit is walking distance from lovely cafes on Avenue Road and we had a fantastic meal at Radio Cairo in Cremorne. The ferry is also walking distance but it is a bit of a hike up the hill, but great views on the way! All in all a very positive experience and very good value for money for accommodation in Sydney!

My friends and I stay at Sydney for 8 nights in your apartment. The location is very convenient. We can visit any places in a very short time. Your place is very fancy and comfortable.

We will be back!"
2019-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Sylvie,"Anita, your hospitality and your apartment were beyond our expectations of what an Airbnb could be. Every day, we discovered new things tucked away in drawers that made our stay so easy and feel like a home away from home. Whether it was fresh water in the fridge when we arrived or the sun screen, goggles, moisturiser, short bread cookies, olive oil, instant cappuccino (and the list goes on...), we had more than we needed. 

Not to mention the view and the light. I'm not sure we can stay anywhere else in Bondi without thinking of your home. Thank you again for your warmth! We look forward to staying in your apartment again -- and recommending it to our friends."

 I suggest using the bus to and from airport. It's quicker, cheaper (A$2.10 and avoids the unjust cost of the train (A$9.20 to travel 2 stations!). The bus is about 100 metres away."
2016-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Clarence,"The house was big and spacious enough to accommodate the 7 of us! Furnitures are a bit old, but the location of the house was quite centralized.

We couldn't have found a better place to stay, hidden in Susan and Gregs lovely green garden, you feel very private. You have an area of the garden to your self. The studio have all your need for a perfect stay. The soap is lovely (Susan helped us buy some, to take home). The beakfast all organic, lovely mangos, avocado, lovely bread, everyting tasted amazinig. The area has some nice restaurants and coffee shops, bronte beach is lovely to.
You will use a bit of time in public transportation going to Bondi junction. to connect with the train and other busses. You can do amazing walks close to the ocean, and make sure to go to Coogee Beach too.
Susan was a lovely host and took very good care of us and was very helpfull, very easy to communicate with. This is such a lovely place stay and we couldn't have hoped for any better. We hope will have the opportunuty to go back.

Mum (77) found her bed so comfortable she slept through which she doesn't at home. Our hosts were very polite, always responsive in a timely way.

We wish we had more time to enjoy the place and the saltwater ocean pool across the road. Yes we would stay again and look forward to enjoying the delicious slice Bernadette took the time to bake and welcome us with. Thank you for a lovely first AirBnB experience."

We really appreciated being able to stay until after lunch on our leaving day. The apartment was beautifully clean and although cosy had everything we needed.
Vickie was an excellent host and responded to any queries very promptly despite being away at the time.

It's difficult to think of a more stunning spot in Sydney than this iconic building, above the cafe along the Shelley Beach board walk - tranquility itself, no matter the weather.

Thank you so much guys - I'll certainly stay again."

2016-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Olivia,The place was a perfect size room about a 15 minute drive from the airport and about 45 minutes to Sydney by train. We had a blast. The place was clean and had everything we needed. The only downside was no air conditioning but there was a fan in the room so we hardly noticed. I can't wait to go back. I would definitely recommend!!
2018-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,22362742,Sheronna,"Very pleasant stay, however, a few cockroaches and spiders that visited that made it a tad unpleasant. Host did have bug spray which was great. And host was a great communicator and had other people to contact in her absence. Lovely and thoughtful touches and very convenient location. And, the cleaners were very lovely as well. Thanks Eleni."

2017-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Hannah,"This was our second stay at Rachel's place. The location of this property is brilliant. Right in the heart of affluent and central suburb Mosman, loads of things for kids to do close by - amazing pizza, oval, park, shops, public pool. Perfect. All you need is in walking distance. The accommodation itself is lovely and everything you could want for a family stay.  "

2016-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Noella,Enjoyed the few days I spent at this property. Was not familiar with the Malabar area although I have lived in the Sydney eastern suburbs for many years. Quite a discovery! Being in Sydney but feeling like being on a weekend on the South Coast. Lovely. The apartment is very nice with all facilities and very comfortable. Very welcoming thoughtful attentions.
2017-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Khem,Great place in an awesome location. Good value for money.

2016-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Nga,My family of 6 stayed recently for 4 nights leading towards the new year. Sam was very friendly and his responses to fixing issues we had were prompt - very easy to talk to. The fridge was replaced with a new one and works very well! The aircon in the living room and bedroom was a huge plus! We stayed very comfortably :) Thank you!
2016-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,6361929,Jörg,Edi is a wonderfull person and a great host. She was so friendly and helpful and didn't hesitate to show us around. The room (very clean) and the location (really close to the station) are perfect. Totally recommended! Thank you Edi!
2017-05-22T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Cliff,"It is a nice place with every necessities. Close to the train station, only 2 minutes walk. Easy to get to the city, only 10-15 min. Fully-equipped kitchen. Everything is clean and tidy. "

The pictures can't even begin to describe the warmth and and comfort of this immaculately furnished, fully equipped 2 bedroom apartment! With on site parking, a laundry, the most comfortable bedding I have ever slept in, an amazingly sunlight filled kitchen and in one of Sydney cutest suburbs this place was perfect for anyone wanting to visit Sydney! Close to shops, cafés and restaurants and only minutes drive from the cbd staying here was one of the best decisions I have made when visiting Sydney! Louise is wonderful and caters to your every need and is easy to contact! I highly recommend staying here to anyone who is wanting to visit Sydney for any period of time!! :) "
2017-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,15312988,Maisie,"Cindy's place is a small, clean and cosy room to explore Sydney. Cindy and Mikki are friendly and helpful and gave me my own space. It is near Coogee beach but I missed a chance to go to the beach due to the rain while I was there. It is near several buses to get into town and also near cafes, restaurants and shops. "
2015-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,6170899,David,"Very glad we chose this place. Three good size bedrooms, 2 living areas and separate well appointed kitchen/dining, private courtyard - all we could have hoped for. Our friendly and obliging host, Jennifer, met us on arrival and showed us round, clearly explaining the features of the property.  Parking outside, quiet street yet close to the main drag of Balmain makes it an excellent location. "
2018-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Robin,Great space in an excellent location.

2017-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Phillip,"Paul and Judith were incredibly kind hosts who made me and my partner feel incredibly welcome during our stay in their beautiful home. They helped us tremendously in finding our way around Sydney and offered wonderful suggestions for us to do. 
The room itself was lovely and spacious, and the house is located in such a great neighbourhood, chock full of great shops and restaurants. I'm so happy to have come across this true find and I highly recommend staying here! "
2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Jessica,"A great, cosy place to stay. Very stylish and clean with all the basics that you need."
2018-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Nicole,"This was the first Air bnb booking I have done and I was a bit nervous.  It was the best experience ever.  Cat is an extremely gracious hostess.  Very friendly, great communication and really thoughtful, unexpectedly offering us early check in and late check out because it was possible. 

The house has a lovely friendly feel to it, and is as amazing as the pictures look, they are accurate.   Loved sitting in the beautiful courtyard, sipping champagne and enjoying the fish.

So many small attentions to detail.... having champagne stoppers, insect repellant and a really helpful guide to the house and how to navigate the surrounding areas. Lovely toiletries and an amazing open fire - yes I had the fire going, not because it was really cold, but because I love an open fire and this was one of the reasons I chose the property.  Cat was very accommodating with this and we had plenty of firewood. The fire burnt and drew well.

Great location. The house is a very easy walk to Bondi Beach, even for unfit me, and an even shorter walk to groceries, bottle shop, cafe and restaurants.

Parking is the only thing that is a bit awkward.  The listing description is accurate in this regard.  If you have a regular size car you will not be able to get into the driveway, which is such a shame.  We were able to get longer stay parking in other streets, but this obviously wasn't as convenient. It was doable though.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and intend to stay there again."
2018-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Eleanor,"Angela & Geoff’s place is beyond exceptional. My husband and I and our 2 young children spent 2 very enjoyable and comfortable nights there. The apartment is private, really quiet and beautifully stylish. The beds are the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. Angela made sure there were toys and a travel cot for my 2 year old and responded so quickly to any questions I had. Fantastic stay, loved it!!!"
2017-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,6170899,Joe,"The Balmain Garden Home was perfect, the home is comfortable and beautifully decorated, it has all the amenities and very close proximity to public transport, restaurants and shops and a quick Bus or Ferry ride into the CBD. Jennifer is a wonderful host and very responsive and it was a pleasure to meet here. We hope to be able to stay here again sometime in the future. Very highly recommended."

2017-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Tiffany,"Overall experience was below expectation. The photos were all modern and new looking, however, the house itself said it the other way.

Saw two cockroaches in the bathroom, floor full of hair (nasty!), loud noises at night (party and chit chat next door until 2am), overall cleanliness is about  a C-"

2018-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,23364269,Sarka,"It was a nice apartment to stay in and it is worth the price. 
The only problem in the area is parking, as it is challenging to find a free spot- since we owned a car. There are also planes flying over the complexes, therefore there will be some noise, but not often- it wasn’t as noticeable for us. 
Otherwise it was a nice stay with all appliances and necessities provided- also Hafid was fast to respond to our messages. Recommend."

The room has plenty of sleeping quarters, the bathroom is stocked with all essentials (shampoo, conditioner, body  wash, hair dryer), and  breakfasts are light and delicious.   Having a refrigerator, microwave,tea and coffee pot are helpful; and a washing machine within the unit is terrific.  The family accommodated all are requests; we traveled some days as two persons and some days we had three persons.  Leslie helped us with restaurant suggestions and paths to walk.  "

And when Wyatt was away, his sister popped around to make sure that I had everything I needed.  The bed was comfortable, the kitchen and sitting room spacious and everything I needed was available, right down to some tourist brochures and transport timetables on the area.  It soon felt like living in ones own home.  But ones action say more than words.  I have booked to extend my current visit here and also booked a return visit on my way back through Sydney in a weeks time. Thank you Wyatt, great place."

The hosts are creative and cosmopolitan people, offering space for guests is a natural extension of their love for travel and interesting places and people. They were helpful and welcoming. Check in and out was hassle-free and straightforward. St Peters is a growing artistic hub in Sydney and this listing captures that ethos .Convenient to transport, 10 minutes by train from the CBD, comfortable, well equipped, the spaciousness of this listing is a real stand out feature and  3 people could fit in here. Read the description, the owners are accurate in their outline of the space, but nothing could be faulted in cleanliness, comfort and the facilities provided, would be happy to retur"

2017-11-07T05:00:00.000Z,19574869,Kyle,At first I was a bit taken back due to the age of the apartment compared to what I am used to for that price.

A highly recommended stay! "

Beautiful balmoral beach is. 20 minute walk away - it's a good walk (not one you'd want to do with kids though) Balmoral is a stunning place to relax and swim! The apartment is a 5 minute walk to some great local food options and shops. Lovely quiet area but so close to everything makes is a perfect option!

The provided breakfast food delicious. Susan was prompt in replying to queries before my stay and then on the day was really terrific helping out with a rushed task that was well above the expected. I would recommend Bronte B&B unreservedly.

The apartment was exceptionally clean and stylishly decorated. Above and beyond, Suzie was very warm and welcoming. Ready and willing to provide local recommendations, but also respecting when to give privacy. Very enjoyable stay."

2018-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Carole,I booked Victoria’s place for my parents to stay while they were visiting Syndey for two nights. They had a great trip and loved Victoria’s place. I knew it would be perfect for them as they aren’t well travelled and didn’t know Sydney at all. Victoria was the perfect and host and checked them in early and helped with anything they needed. If I make it to Sydney I will definitely be checking this place for availability. Thanks again Vickie!
2014-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Elaine,"We had our second stay at Caths Garden Studio and it was again perfect for our needs. We got up early and ate the breakfAst provided before heading out, but a pleasant spot to relax too. Every need met. We'll be back!"
2017-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,13689460,Katey,My stay here was great! Awesome location and the hosts go above and beyond. There was milk and bread left for us to eat/drink and they were available for any questions offering perfect suggestions. Would recommend to a friend
2017-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Sharni,"This place is excellent! We had the best stay, it was so close to everything! Communication with host was great, very comfortable for 6 adults. Would definitely stay again!"
2017-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Charne,"My partner and I stayed here for 5 nights. This is a lovely small apartment, that had everything we needed. It was very clean and modern. In the perfect location if you are looking to explore the city, kings cross station is just a 10 minute walk away. The streets surrounding he apartment are full of small business shops and there is a convenience store right across the road. We would definitely rebook if we were travelling here again. Unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to meet Victoria, due to our arrival time. However she responded fast to messages and was very helpful."
2018-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,21612973,Nadine,"Most amazing room ever! Cosy bed, awesome furniture and lovely host! Highly recommend this place !"
2017-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Phillip,Hernan was a delightful gentleman and incredibly helpful and accommodating with checkin and my stay.  His place was a charming little unit and more than comfortable for my needs ... would happily stay again should I be in the neighbourhood
2016-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Robert & Lynn,We were made o feel very welcome by Shuang and his family. The room was quite spacious and very well fitted out. We were overnighting to pick up an international flight out of Sydney and found the location to the airport very handy.
2018-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,22020910,Dione,"I booked this room for a colleague who was visiting on a secondment, and he was very happy with the stay. A great way to wow visitors from London - access to one of our most iconic beaches. He said it was very convenient, well-appointment, comfortable and well-stocked with thoughtful additions, which was really useful to him. It's very likely we will be booking again."
2015-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,5116907,Tevita,"Anthony's place was just as described. Great location, very clean, walking distance to everywhere. 10 minutes to the beach and even closer to cafes and shops.I would definitely stay there again and recommend it when staying in bondi "

Also the apartment needed a good clean. This was our first experience with a air BnB and although the location was great and the apartments views were fantastic the hygiene was appalling"
2017-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Anne,"Centrally located close to Town Hall Station, this place is my new favorite in Sydney. The views.were.absolutely.amazing.mind blowing. 
The TV was left off, there is enough entertainment sitting in the couch looking out the big windows in front. This apartment has everything what you need for a convenient stay. I will definitely book again!
If you drive with your own car to Sydney, the best carpark would be the one in Sussex street (Wilson)- 20 dollars a day for a bay"
2019-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,24863216,Nicky,"Vivian's place was perfect for my parents stay in Bronte. It was beautifully presented, very clean and in a great location for exploring the beaches. The use of space and private entrance were great. I would highly recommend this air bnb."

2019-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Belinda,"I have to say it was tough to be in the apartment with only a small fan during this heat, but perhaps the apartment would be quite comfortable for guests during other seasons. Some areas of the apartment don’t match the current photos anymore, such as the bathroom and the living room. Unfortunately, we also had to deal with several cockroaches (live and dead) in the apartment during our one week stay here. That being said, I thank the host(s) for being accommodating with our late check in request for the first night. Also, the location of the apartment is great, with close walking distance to king’s cross station which can conveniently get you anywhere. Cute brunch spots on the next street. Thanks."
2018-04-25T04:00:00.000Z,22020910,Andrew,This apartment was a perfect getaway. It had everything you need. It was walking distance from shops and restaurants and a bus stop a stones throw away. Anita was super helpful and very hospitable making our stay that little bit better.
2018-06-16T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Julia,"A lovely rustic beach house with good sized beds and great spots for family entertaining.

Also they are a great designer of their house! The photos hanging in the room are the great proof! Next time if I have a long term vacation, I'll still choose to live here! Thank you, Duncan and Ashlee! Best experience in Sydney. "

2014-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,888107,Zoei,"Wyatt has been a really great host! The place was comfy and the toilet was kept clean all the time. The place was also very convenient and easily accessible to all the attractions like Sydney Opera House, Darling Habour, Chinatown and the City. I really enjoyed my stay there and look forward to renting the place again if I go back to sydney."

2015-05-25T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Andy,"Had a fantastiic stay at Wayne and Kate's place. 

We arrived on Friday night in windy and rainy conditions, but were soon cosy in the apartment with the girls snuggled in the provided blankets, and with the heaters on!

Everything that we needed was provided for and the hosts quickly answered a couple of texts I sent with questions about the apartment. 

Waking up to blue skies and the sight of the ocean on the Saturday morning was awesome. 

Would love to come back and experience the place is summer! 

Thanks to the hosts "
2017-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Anna,Rachel's place is an amazing house within a perfect location. It is situated within walking distance of most things and the house itself is amazing! 5 of us were very comfortable in the house for a long weekend.

Great location for restaurants, and walking distance to the beach."

2016-07-05T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Juliette,"I was an AIRBNB virgin  and I found my first  experience overwhelmingly positive.

The garden pavilion behind a typical Sydney historic cottage was cute, clean, compact but above all comfortable.
With an ensuite bathroom, heating, microwave, hot water jug I had everything I needed for a business, conference and research related trip.
Wonderful gourmet café style breakfast options and a generous and considerate host enhanced the experience even further.
The position  is ideal for Sydney busses with several options for the Unviersity of Sydney, University of New South Wales, Central Station and the CBD. Parramatta Rd is about 10/12 mins walk away
The district is cosmopolitan and convenient with many reasonably priced restaurants, cafes, pubs and a supermarket again about 5-10 minutes walk away. I found it safe and quiet, ideal for either business or the non-extreme traveller
Like most of historic inner west/southwest Sydney, jet aircraft fly remarkably close above one's head in this suburb on occasions 
I can not praise this  facility too much and  if all AIRBNB's are like this  ... well.. viva la revolucion "
2017-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Michael,"Susan and Greg provide a beautiful space which misses nothing a hotel provides (ok maybe room service but I didn't want that) yet with extras such as privacy, quietude and a beautiful garden setting.  I also really appreciated Susans timely responses made in a very professional yet greatly warm way. Highly recommended  ("" "
2018-06-15T04:00:00.000Z,16964637,Steph,"Thanks for a good stay! Room was big and clean - only issue was the shared kitchen space could get a little messy and there were ants in the bathroom but not a major issue! Heater worked well, bathroom big and clean, very close to big shopping mall with restaurants and close to the train line! Simple but good! Only addition I would include would be a mini fridge in the bedroom - there’s space for it and would make it a more private space without the hassle of a shared kitchen - especially as I was visiting on a work trip and had to leave very early in the morning and was worried I’d disturb other guests."
2018-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,26829659,Amy,Joseph was a great host and was very accommodating. Thankyou for letting us stay in your lovely apartment!  Was exactly what we were needing

2014-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Thomas,"Gavin was a great host! He was welcoming, friendly and great to speak with. He knows the area quite well and is always willing to offer advice. Although we didn't see him too much we were lucky enough to have Gavin come along to breakfast with us before we left. He showed us some great places to eat and was very entertaining. The room was exactly as advertised, except the bed was brand new and super comfortable. The bed in the current picture doesn't do it justice. Surry Hills is excellent. It's about a 10 minute walk from some great bars, and cafes and about a 5 minute walk from Central train station. Overall it was a wonderful stay."

Mags was extremely courteous and helpful in answering any queries or issues that we encountered, and everything was dealt with in a concerned and expedient manner, including one unexpected issue that was quickly resolved ( thanks Mags and James :) The flat was well fitted out and we would love to visit again. One of the nicest places we have visited in Sydney. Thanks again Mags!!"

2014-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Sarah,"I did not personally stay with Cath, as we booked her room for an employee on an extended out of town stay. The booking process was very easy, and Cath was very understanding of our needs for the accommodation. 

The feedback from our staff member has been great - so much so he has requested that when he returns that he stays with Cath once more. The room is in a very central location of the Inner West region, with great access to buses, trains and the light rail at Dulwich Hill. 

I would highly recommend Cath's property for anyone looking for a cosy, homely location to stay :) Thanks Cath!"

We have already booked his place again in June."

2015-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Lily,"My overall experience at Redfern at Kath's was very high and enjoyable. This room was actually my second room staying with Kath right after the first which was also a wonderful experience. Kath was consistently a wonderful lady who made my partner and I feel very welcome right from the start, all the way to the end. Even prior to meeting her in person, what  I was impressed with how highly responsive Kath was with communication. She was very welcoming and friendly with an approachable nature. The room was very accurate to description; quite large and spacious with lots of natural light, especially with a wonderful and large balcony attached. I was very impressed with the interior design of the room by Kath herself which brought out the unique aspects, and brought character to the room. It was bright and beautiful with wonderful combinations of patterns and colours. It was very impressive. Everything was accessible and ready when we arrived, including many fresh towels, shampoo, conditioner, body wash etc.,as well as chargers on either sides of the bed. The bed itself was very large and comfortable. Additionally, Kath even went out shopping and brought home cereal etc. which made us feel welcome. In addition, the accommodation at Redfern itself was quite convenient. It was approximately 200m away from the train station which was very close by Central (even within walking distance ~15mins). Late night shops, especially bars and restaurants were also close-by and near walking distance. Definitely will be recommending to family and friends to stay :). Thanks Kath. "

2017-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,10091713,Kate,Cute studio apartment with bridge views. Easy walk to Darling Harbor and very friendly and accomodating host. Would definitely recommend Ben's place.

2019-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Honey,Ana was very attentive and helpful.   Perfect location for us.
2017-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,1090153,Charlotte,"A very welcoming host as we were greeted with a much appreciated hamper of food and Christmas crackers when we arrived and the use of the car was very useful! A lovely area of welcoming neighbours and a selection of good shops/cafes, just a steep walk to the beach unfortunately which wasn't a problem for us, but perhaps the more elderly or young would have issues with. The house was as described and in a beautiful location on the northern beaches with the morning sun on the terrace for breakfast! Overall we had a fantastic family holiday here and would come again. "
2017-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Joshua,"Marcella was very helpful and easy to contact, and the place was great and have everything we need for a group of 9!
The only downside was the floor wasn't that clean, but overall the place was huge and we had awesome stay!"
2019-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Claire,Modern spacious apartment in fantastic location with very easy access to transport to and from the city. Very welcoming and accommodating host - an overall great experience!

I definitely recommend this place for travellers who like a place to settle for 1 week or more.. 
thanks :)

2018-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,12098138,Michael,"This apartment is excellent - location is a stone's throw to the beach, coastal walk and great cafes, fantastic view, and a really well kept, comfortable and complete apartment for a family.  Thoroughly recommended"
2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Tom,"Vickie was a great host, gave us plenty of local tips when we arrived and made us feel very welcome. Lovely apartment in an ideal location for the city and the beaches! "
2017-06-05T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Jessica,"We had a wonderful stay in Desiree's apartment.  Great location, spotlessly clean and very homely.  Would definitely stay again."
2018-06-07T04:00:00.000Z,20906942,Julie,"This place is in a good location! Beside the quite street, things are clean and the host is very helpful!"
2016-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Gonçalo,"Very good hosts, room matched indications. 5 min walk to the beach, very convenient. Room was a bit too hot but mainly because I preferred to shut down the window to avoid any bugs at night. There is also a fan system if required. "
2018-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,22536752,William,Nice room at a good price. OK for getting your head down at night and getting sone rest. Host sounded very friendly through communication.
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,22296970,Jay,Really enjoyed staying with Serena and Mohmed!
2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Keira,"We enjoyed our stay at Rachels home, however there were positives and negatives. Positives were the décor, the spacious bedrooms, the comfortable beds, the backyard area and the location. Although I didn’t get to meet Rachel, she seems very friendly. 

Overall, the cleanliness was unsatisfactory. The kitchen needed a good clean. The fridge interior, kitchen drawers and kitchen floor were all food stained. We had to wash all the unclean cutlery, glasses, pots, etc before using them. We also found dirty items in the dishwasher. We wanted to use the outside table for a group lunch but the large umbrella appeared to be broken and fixed or stuck in the corner.  

While the location is great to walk to restaurants, shops and down to Balmoral Beach, the noise of car traffic is very loud in the mornings. Difficult to sleep beyond 7am. The wifi did not work at all. We tried on many devices and nothing. Before we checked out, a broadband company arrived so hopefully the wifi will be ready for the next tenants."
2017-06-27T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Richard,"Simon and Nicole's place was perfect for my needs. The location means that great cafes and restaurants, the central train station, the business district, and many of the main tourist attractions are all walkable.  The apartment is well equipped with high quality appliances and, best of all, a super-comfy bed! Nicole was responsive to all questions or requests, even though she was out of town at the time. I'll definitely try to stay here again the next time I visit Sydney."
2018-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,16651655,Ajith,Excellent location close to airport ... Steven was really friendly and nice... excellent spot for a stop over...Thanks Steven
2016-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Cheryl,Thanks Belinda for welcoming us to your beautiful Garden Studio.  We were also very greatful with your flexibility in changing the night for us as per our request.  The studio was well appointed with a great kitchen which had everything that I required to cook our meals etc.  Shower was also great.  Very close to beach and amenities.  Bundeena is lovely place to visit and Belinda's studio is a perfect place for a couple.
2017-08-04T04:00:00.000Z,18345625,Marion,"Nice well furnished room in a quiet neighborhood. Hosts are very kind and helpful, the dog is really cute, you'll fall in love with him.

2018-06-30T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,良路,close to the airport. 10 mins walking to the closest train station. nice 2-floor apartment with all necessary infrastructure.
2017-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Maria,"This house is perfect for a large extended family group. It has so much room that you can go off and have a quiet time by yourself even if the house is fully occupied. The beds, bedding and towels are high quality, and the kitchen has everything you need to cater for a large group. The private beach and the hot tub are wonderful for just hanging out and relaxing. The house's many levels mean that even crying babies don't disturb others in the house.
Waking up to the gorgeous views of the trees, boats and water can't be matched. I would highly recommend this house and would come back."
2018-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,18620288,Owen & Judy,Excellent place to stay in Sydney
2018-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Andrew,Great self contained garden bungalow.  Close to transport and a short walk to coffee and cafes in norton street.

Larry et Casey sont des gens géniaux, d’une grande hospitalité et de bons conseils ! Nous n’hésiterons pas à retourner dans leur belle maison dès notre retour à Sydney !"
2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Thilina Chamara Madusanka,"Our main destinations were Sydney CBD and blue mountain. We found Serah's place as an ideal convenient place in between.  We are a big family of four adults and three children and we still found enough space. Haven't got time to use the pool though. There is a big dining table in the back where we had nice family dinner. We used the washing machine and dryer too. 

Sarah is a wonderful host too. She replied to my SMS's in no time. Thanks for being so friendly Sarah"
2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Christina,"I spent two nights at Michele's place and had a great stay. It's near some cool cafes in Newtown (which Michele kindly recommended), and it's an easy walk to the train station. The space itself is fairly small but it's bright, modern and clean and had everything I needed. The fruit and cereal were great to have in the morning and the shower was excellent. Michele was also very accommodating about me dropping off my bag earlier in the day and was always quick to respond to any messages. I would happily stay here again!"
2016-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,8392955,Steph,"Absolutely wonderful stay at a beautiful home! Thank you so much Helen, you were helpful and went above and beyond during the whole booking process. Place was spotless when we arrived and beautifully decorated. Would 100% recommend and come back. Thank you "
2016-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Van,Our family has such a wonderful time living in Heidi's house. We have 7 adults and 1 baby and this house comfortably accommodates all. It is a very nice house with every convenient facility you could ask for a holiday rental. Heidi even got a rice cooker and so many spices that we use for our cooking. It's so great because my family is from Vietnam and they love to cook and cannot live without rice. We also have great time using the clean pool and barbecue. My husband and I had a good experience when taking my 5 month baby to swim for the first time. Heidi is a fantastic host that welcomed us in the first day and showed us every corner of the house. We are very satisfied and definitely will come back here if we have a chance
2018-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,22124796,Jaco,"This was my second visit and I enjoyed it as much as the first time. The location is perfect both for business travel, being close to the CBD as well as leisure, being close to the harbour.

Thanks again."
2018-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,23510317,Kc,"A super convient place. The location is just great. The room is really clean and cozy. Although the kitchen is bit small, it is enough for me to make simple meal."
2016-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Janelle,Could not speak highly enough of the host! I let her know it was a surprise for my husbands birthday. She went out of the way to put up banners and purchase a cake as a surprise for us! Communication was A+! The room was fabulous and so clean and comfy! Thanku so very much!

2016-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Liam,"This was my first Airbnb and after my wonderful experience with Craig, Leoni and family it will not be my last. Friendly interacting hosts, beautiful patio area with wild parrots flying around (great place to relax after a hectic day), large kitchen, dining area and sitting room,bedroom with private (Website hidden by Airbnb) were always made feel at home. Great quiet area close to Bondi Beach and shops and restaurants very close by.Why pay over twice as much for a small hotel room."
2018-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Catherine,"Vue incroyable du balcon, beau quartier, hôte à l'écoute de nos besoins. L'appartement en soit est humide car au sous-sol mais bon rapport qualité-prix."
2017-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Fiona,"Great apartment very close to everything you need in Manly without all the noise. Apartment came with all the basics (sheets, towels, parking permit, shampoo, tea) and it’s a short walk to the nearest supermarket, transport, beach, bars, takeaways etc. 
Apartment has two main bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, living room but also a little sunroom for extra space so it has a lovely feel to it. We very much enjoyed our stay and would happily come back again. Thank you Paul."
2016-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,10209136,Shabilla,"Isaac's house was as beautiful as can be, the room had sunlight and was cozy, clean and neat. 
cozy small kitchen comes with the room and a lively backyard with a lovely and very friendly dog that is not shy to say hello to you.

Definitely recommend staying at Isaac's, as he is also very nice and kind.."
2017-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Claire,"Wow just what the doctor ordered. EVERY tiny thing you needed was there from coffe, milk, appliances, crockery, cutlery, vegemite even tinned tomatoes, shower gel, etc. VERY COOL DVDS, classy chess set, glad wrap salt pepper maps - you name it. All new. All fresh. All those things you hate having to buy at every hotel stay - you dont need to here. Most of all absolute Zen atmosphere. Beautiful, restful location. IGA had anything else you may need. Exemplary communication  cant wait to come back. So grateful to our amazingly accommodating but discreet hosts. Mwah!"
2016-08-04T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Rachel,"Fantastic apartment and only a 1 minute walk to Avalon beach. The apartment is beautifully furnished having 2 large double bedrooms both with ensuite bathrooms and it has everything you need. The hosts were very thoughtful and left fresh milk, bread and loads of other essentials, even books for our kids. The apartment is very private and looks out on a lush garden, the house is on a quiet street and access to the beach is  at the end of the road. Avalon village is also within walking distance and has lots of cafes, restaurants and cute shops. Absolutely recommend this property!!"

2016-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,13299549,Leonie & Bill,"We had a wonderful time in Sydney in every way, superb dining, still savouring the memories, excellent sightseeing, the apartment worked out brilliantly, quiet, clean, perfect for our needs, in a great  location in it's proximity to Circular Quay with all it's forms of transport to anywhere in Sydney, plus cafe's, restaurants, supermarkets and shopping.  We were met on time on arrival at the apartment our host allowing us earlier entry than listed as well as a later departure time to suit our incoming and out going flights which we really did appreciate. Any issues were dealt with efficiently as per 11 light bulbs which were out and needed changing.  Thanks so much for a lovely stay, we'd definitely book the apartment again.  

Warm regards
Leonie

2016-08-09T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,James,"Marcella's house was perfect for our reunion of two families (each of 2 adults and 2 kids). Both families were comfortable and at the same time not feeling that they were living on top of each other. The house had everything we needed to have meals in as well as a good choice of venues within 5 minutes walk. The area is great with the nice beach on the doorstep. The city was easy to access (40 mins by bus traffic permitting) with the bus stop just around the corner. No complaints from us and we will definitely consider staying again should we require so many beds!

2017-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,18338274,Jay,"Staying at Bill's place is a home away from home. Beautifully decorated and enough room for 3 couples. Comfy beds, beautiful courtyard. It has everything you need, full kitchen if cooking. Very conveniently located in Glebe, only minutes from Light Rail Station, a short walk to Glebe Point Road to busses that take you into the CBD, lots and lots of restaurants, cafes, supermarkets. A short walk to the Glebe Markets held every Saturday (a must do in Glebe). Bill was very helpful and prompt in communicating, his book is very informative. Parking is scarce in Glebe, however Bill was able to supply parking permits at a very small cost. Value for money!!!"
2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,18083735,Kevin,"TOP 1 choice is you want to stay in Sydney no matter travel or work , you can have tranquil life in here with adorable cat and energetic frogs,. Also you can meditate in imposing garden and grab a cup of coffee. Greg and Maggie can give you plentiful information about transportation."
2018-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,19508741,Christopher,"Very hospitable hosts! Great location, close to local amenities and the beaches. Excellent value for money."
2018-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Bronwyn,Such a large and comfortable and well equipped Airbnb is hard to find in this area.  It has lots of space and is extremely well equipped. A gem.
2016-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Jessica,"Wayne and Kate's place is why I love Airbnb. Coordinating our arrival and check out was a breeze - and the apartment was everything it promised - big, sunny and right on the beach. I hope we get to return soon. "
2018-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,James,Fantastic location halfway between the city and the Sydney Olympic Park complex. Perfect for those in town for entertainment and then being able to enjoy all the things Sydney city have to offer. Would easily recommend and return in a moments notice. 5 stars all the way!
2018-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Susan,"This is the ideal location for a single person or couple if you plan on travelling around Sydney and to country NSW. Public transport to everywhere is at your doorstep including trains, buses and light rail. A small convenience store is next door for milk and snacks. The range there, however, is limited and you would struggle to find ingredients to make a meal. Other food options are very close by. The bed is very comfortable and the balconies have nice views over Central Station towards Haymarket. Although there was a little bit of noise from the trains, it was minimal."
2018-06-29T04:00:00.000Z,23357535,Kathryn,"Great, central location in the Sydney CBD. Very close to Martin Place railway station, and a wonderful IGA supermarket allowing for self-catering.  The apartment is a good size, and nice to have a small balcony with furniture when the weather is warmer. The bedroom is spacious with a large king bed and mirrored wardrobes. The kitchen is a good size and has everything to knock up a meal. If staying longer, having the cupboard laundry is a huge bonus. We will return when staying in Sydney again. Highly recommended. Johannes was good to communicate with, and arrival and departure was simple."
2018-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,19508741,Claire,In terms of the location it was perfect where we needed to be. The Newport pub was superb and only a couple minutes walk down the road. The homemade marmalade and muffins were delicious and a truly delicious idea. Tessa and Rod went out of their way to assist us and make us feel at home. The place also has some privacy which is great. We will definitely visit again!!
2018-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,23428550,Nan,Great place and well recommended.
2018-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Angie,Hernan's place is in a good location close to shops and the beach. The apartment is on the 3rd floor so if you have a lot of luggage it's  bit awkward to go up and down.  Hernan is very efficient with responding to you.  Very good value for what it is.
2017-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,14921505,Marie,The house is as described and more.  We hosted our mums 80th birthday here and she was blown away by the location.  We had 14 family members staying all having their own great size rooms and areas so we did not feel on top of each other.  I would recommend and will be back again.
2017-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Maxx,"Patrick & Christine's place was amazing. Spacious rooms (the photos make it look smaller instead of bigger!), the area is quiet and peaceful. The sunroom is PERFECT for sitting around with a cup of tea and a book. Communication was clear and friendly, buses right outside and a short walk to a train station, a quick drive/uber/taxi/bus to nightlife in Newtown, it's got everything you'd need. 

Couldn't recommend it enough. Thanks again Christine and Pat!  "

Rooms were nice and clean and modern.   Had a delayed late flight and Angela was very responsive and super easy to communicate with, and facilitated a late check in for me which was greatly appreciated.   Highly recommend this place :)"

It is clean and the private pool with gorgeous views made it so relaxing. It has a stove, microwave and little fridge for when we wanted to reheat food. 

It’s located well with a short 3 min walk to the Forage cafe for excellent morning coffees and short 10-15min drive to Palm Beach for seeing the Lighthouse and dining at the Boathouse or Jonas at Whale Beach or even Bert’s at Newport. 

Evelyn is a great host and we can’t wait to stay here again."
2017-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,12655535,Ella,"Clean and well positioned. Note that the whole building is currently undergoing construction, so as well as the noise (as mentioned in the listing) the halls and elevator are a worksite. The pool and sauna facilities are lovely though. I’m not sure I would stay here again for the price (& the cleaning fee $200+). There is nothing wrong with the apartment itself, however my experience overall was a little underwhelming. "

2015-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Nicola,"The Studio was a lovely place for a weekend for my husband and I to get to know Bundeena. Well appointed, comfortable with a nice beach house decor. Quite private for a backyard studio - we only met the host when picking up and dropping off key - there is a separate entryway and the leafy garden outlook meant it was well screened from the main house. The only sounds were the birds and occasional possum. We enjoyed the breezy verandah which kept us cool on a very warm weekend. Very well located - walking distance to all the best beach spots, walking tracks, shops and ferry. Loved it."
2018-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Michele,"A very comfortable and pleasant apartment in a terrific location, a few minutes walk from the ferry, the beach , and the Manly restaurants and shops."

Highly recommend this place."

2015-03-09T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Margsandmacdaddy,Arnie and Lorraine were excellent hosts. They were welcoming but not intrusive. I stayed at this bnb for 4 nights while my husband was in St Vincents Private Hospital. The bnb was in a great location a 15-20 minute walk to the hospital. It is in a safe area with plenty of cafés and restaurants in the vicinity.  The keyless entry saved the worry about carrying keys. My first time using bnb. A good experience. Thank you.
2018-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,21612973,Dejan,"We enjoyed our Sydney visit from Manly. Why? Because it was great to drive every morning via ferry into the city and to have the great view on the harbour bridge, the skyline and of course the great opera. In fact that was our initial reason to book our days at Jackies flat. In our eyes the best way to travel smoothly into the city without any stress. Our „home“ was great as well, we enjoyed the beautiful flat from the first second on. Worth to mention: Jackie and her husband are great conversation partners."

We stayed just for one night,but felt right at home. We really enjoyed our stay, the little chat, wine and cheese :)
Thanks again!

Thank you, it is a beautiful home and everything was supplied we were all well looked after and I'll be sure to recommend this place to family and friends. Location was conveniently just a short stroll to the beach and shops. Thanks you Marcella "
2018-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,16020247,Joshua,A beautiful and quirky place right amongst the hustle and bustle of Newtown/Enmore. Great amenities and a beautiful garden to sit amongst nature and bath in the sun.

2018-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,16651655,Pip,"I had a lovely stay at Stevens place. He was such a great host, and let me check in super early after a red-eye flight, and was very accommodating. The accomodation was clean and as appeared in photos on AirBnB. Steven was an excellent communicator and was quick with responses on AirBnB chat. Steven also had good tips for navigating the back streets as a shortcut to get to the local train station, and had some great restaurant suggestions. Thanks for a lovely stay :)"
2018-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,23650892,Kirsten,"Naveen's place was absolutely beautiful! Perfect location in vibey Darlinghurst and close to Kings Cross Station and buses. Loads of restaurants nearby.

Check in was super easy with the building concierge who also kindly kept our suitcases after check out when our flight was delayed.

High end toiletries provided. Washing machine and dryer available. Gym on the same floor. Excellent communication. 

Only notable thing is that there is bottle collection early in the morning which didn't really bother us but if you're a light sleeper or wanting somewhere quiet then maybe stay outside the city.

For the city slickers, this apartment is definitely an excellent spot!"

2017-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Skip,Fantastic little apartment with easy access to Darling Harbor and surrounding areas. Will definitely be using this place again in the future.
2018-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Alex,"Immaculately clean, with new modern furnishings and decor, and clear instructions. I would (and definitely tried) to stay here again! Located in what I would call the suburbs so Uber or self-driving is the best, though location is possible with a bit of walking and train/bus as instructed (or check (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps). WiFi was a saviour. It was cold at night but I discovered the heated blanket and all was alright. There is a washer but no dryer, so expect to hang dry."

2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,15960997,Rosette,"I nearly cried when I hugged Terry goodbye. I was there for about 2 weeks and I really felt like I made a friend. Terry was super nice to talk to but she allowed you to set the boundaries so if you wanted to be social, you could and if you didn't want to be,you could have your privacy. Even though the listing technically says that you have a private room and washroom to yourself, I actually had the entire place to myself many days. Terry went the extra mile by taking me out to Salsa night for my birthday and we've had her home-cooked dinner while watching movies. The room comes with several guides on stuff to do in Sydney as well. Everything was clean and there was ample space in the fridge and the cupboards to store your food. Amazing experience overall. "
2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Matt,Hugo was a super host! His apartment had spectacular views and was in a very central and convenient location. Near Townhall train station and a local supermarket. Very much appreciated Hugo’s thoughtfulness with local tips and sites to see and always had quick responses.

Natasha is a wonderful host, welcomed us with a bottle of wine, shared a lot of recommendations for restaurant and activities with us and was always very responsive. The apartment has a perfect location right next to the bondi beach. There is also a rooftop with a fantastic view and the bus station to the city center is just in front of the apartment. The apartment itself is very modern, cozy and you feel at home. It has a perfect size for two people. We will definitely stay there again if we get back to Bondi Beach. Highly recommended."
2015-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Jodie,"We stayed with Kerri after we had moved house and before flying to Europe for a holiday and it was exactly what we needed! Kerri is a lovely, thoughtful host, offering us breakfast for the morning and making sure we were comfortable. Her place is really lovely, the bed is very comfy and the shower is the best! It's also very conveniently located to the cafes, shopping and nightspots of Newtown and Enmore, with the city a short train ride away. I would highly recommend Kerri's to others looking for a Sydney stay. "

My only issue was that the sink was quite small, which made rinsing plates, pots and pans quite difficult before putting them in the dishwasher. Overall, it was a great stay, and dealing with Nicki before the stay was a pleasure. Recommended for someone who wants to stay within walking distance to the city. "
2017-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Franziska,"We stayed in Victoria's place for a bit more than a week.

We enjoyed our stay. Treen was very helpful and quick to respond to our queries.  The house is all we needed with 3 bedrooms, open plan kitchen and living and a small back garden.  A second or bigger bathroom would have been ideal but the houses in the area tend to be small, so not an option. 

Would recommend for a stay in Bondi."

2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,26334724,Monique,"We chose to stay here due to proximity to the Australian Technology Park conference venue - 6-mins walk away!
A great set of cafes, restaurants and bars kept us entertained locally...but 5-mins walk to Redfern Station makes getting to the city or inner-west super-easy too.
Set in a beautiful, safe complex, it’s easy to feel like a local. 
The apartment has everything needed for cooking and a night in too. We hope that the hosts will keep on top of the cleaning, as it’s a great apartment to call home."
2017-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,8571561,Jamie,One of the best Airbnb's I've ever stayed. Rudi and Avalon are total legends and two of the kindest people I've ever stayed with. Would go back in a shot.

2013-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,1098211,Azizi,"My wife, daughter and I had an amazing time in Sydney and staying at Serena's place. 

The location is great, it is walking distance from most tourist attractions in the city (if you love a bit of walking like we do - about 25 mins walking to Opera house, Darling Harbour).  Supermarket is just around the corner. And if you are a Muslim looking for halal food, there are a couple of halal restaurants about 5 mins walk from the apartment. 

Serena's apartment is nice and cozy, the kitchen is well equipped for cooking a simple meal. 

Oh and Serena is very flexible with check-ins and check-outs; which is super helpful when travelling with a toddler. 

All in all, it is a great place to stay if you are travelling as a couple or with a small child. "

2014-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Christine,"This is a great place to stay, beautifully presented, very private (including own entrance), great location (in terms of proximity to Bronte beach, the Bondi cliff walk, local restaurants and public transport to the city), and extremely comfortable. The apartment is set at the rear of the stunning backyard garden with its own outside private area with table and chairs. Hosts are engaging, helpful and interesting without being intrusive."
2016-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Po Yi,"The location is very good, a 3 min walk to Kingscross station and easy to find. The house is clean enough. Worth the price."

2014-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Gerard,"Marcella's house at Maroubra is a wonderful space that hosted our party of seven adults easily. Two minute walk to the beach and around the corner from a club, hotel and restaurants. We had a fantastic time. Marcella responded quickly to our request and was happy to accommodate a late departure. Thanks Marcella."
2019-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,13320545,Jessica,"The location is perfect, close to everything (between Bondi beach and the Opera house). There is a bus stop very close to have easily access to everything.

2017-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Colin,"My partner and I stayed in this clean spacious apartment for five nights. It's right in the heart of Surry Hills, a five-minute walk to all kinds of fun shops and restaurants. We walked *everywhere* during our stay---to the harbor many times, and to many parks and neighborhoods. We enjoyed returning to this apartment and relaxing in the evenings. We loved the building's roof deck---seriously, it's a delight!---and fitness center. We cooked almost every night while we were there, and loved the easy walk to great markets. Nicole was out of town during our stay, but still she and Simon responded to us promptly. We're very glad we stayed here."

2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,7439246,Alex,Nathan and April are great hosts and their place is top notch. Beachfront with a bus stop that goes almost everywhere in Sydney is tough to find. If you love the beach and surfing this is the place to go!

2018-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,22536824,Ivan Geoffrey,Enjoyed my time staying in Clare’s house. Her place was modern and clean. The proximity to the train station was perfect. I could go anywhere I want easily. Its in the quiet end of Newtown so you wont get bothered by the youthful crowd. Clare made my stay as comfortable as possible giving me tips and tricks around the area and the city. Wouldn’t mind staying there again in the future.
2015-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Nicole,"Simone's house was the perfect location for our purpose in attending a conference nearby at the uni. It was bright and airy with plenty of room for 3 of us. It was also quite handy having the extra toilet outside!
The pantry is well stocked with the basics like salt, pepper, oil etc and there was a lovely bottle of wine in the fridge on arrival.
The nights were a little cool and although we found an extra blanket, we all felt we could have done with a quilt/doona as well.  The WIFI seemed a little slow...perhaps it was shaped at that time? but i found i needed to use my own personal hot spot on my phone rather than wait for the house wifi to load up.
The location is great as is also close to Coogee beach and The Spot offering a great variety of restaurants."
2016-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Adrian,"Great, spacious and clean apartment in an awesome location. My only suggestion would be two sets of keys, as myself and my colleague with whom I was staying had different dinner plans and had to coordinate to meet up in the city somewhere so we could return home at the same time. Would stay again, thanks."
2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Ian,Cathy's place is very clean and comfortable and is ideally suited to short stays. It is located within walking difference to shops and restaurants etc. We were very happy with our stay.

The location was also easily identifiable and close too to train stations.
Check in was smooth even though Terry was out on work. We had everything we needed right from bathroom amenities and a comfortable night stay.
Note for future travelers - make sure the right Vibe hotel ( Rushcutters bay) is entered in address as there are a couple of Vibe hotels in Sydney"

2016-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Mike,"This is a clean, conveniently located apartment surrounded by an excellent selection of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants. It is just a few minutes walk from the train station (subway) and about a 20-minute walk from the CBD. The host, Paul, was very pro-active with email communications and very helpfully arranged for us to drop our bags off in the morning before the apartment had been cleaned, allowing us to spend the day in the city luggage-free. "

Unfortunately dryer and dishwasher were broken at the same time and it couldnt be fixed during our stay. Other than that our stay was very pleasant and welcoming. I would definately recommend Mohit's place for sydney visit. Close to city and shopping places. Big Cheers to Mohit and his places. Best wishes"
2018-06-30T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Marlo,Location is incredible and the apartment is cosy but well laid out. Bed is super comfortable and on a Saturday you can cross the road for the markets and listen to some live music with a coffee. Nothing I wouldn't recommend about this place!
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Monique,"Perfect for a mini break and a fantastic alternative to a hotel. Clean, comfortable and very welcoming. It was a oasis!"

2015-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Damian,Beautifully renovated one bedroom apartment in the gentrified Potts Point area in a classic old building. Close to fantastic cafes and food outlets and transport. Very convenient.  Will definitely be back!
2018-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,17829178,Sallie,"This place had so much potential but sadly didn’t quite deliver. It is certainly a trendy apartment but the place was incredibly noisy, both from the street & the upstairs tenants. The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I’ve ever slept in & really is ready for the tip as it has lost all springs through the middle section. I was disappointed that there was not even coffee or tea supplied & the bathroom soaks through after 1 shower (the bath mat easily become saturated). I was also disappointed that you had to pay up to an extra $75 to have the spare bed made up when requiring 2 beds for 2 guest, so we just bunked in together.
On a positive, after requesting an iron she did eventually deliver, unfortunately it was on our last day of our stay."

The apartment was very clean with a well-stocked kitchen - everything we needed to have an enjoyable stay was right at our fingertips and Louise was incredibly helpful and had great suggestions for things to do/see. Would recommend for anyone looking for a cozy home base to explore Sydney!
2018-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,5549057,Joseph,"Very recommended place to stay at Bondi Beach. Only 7 minutes walk from the beach. Brendan is an amazing host with kind heart and very helpful. He gave us a list of places to visit in Bondi, we could not visit all of them though. But we really enjoy staying in Bondi beach for 2 days. Brendan also gave us a short tour to Bondi beach, when we checked in. His place is very clean and stylish. Thank you so much for everything, Brendan. Cheers, Joseph & Jenny."

2016-08-28T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Amanda,"We were thrilled with our stay here.  The location was great - it's centrally located near a main train station (Central) and it's a few blocks away from a grocery store, cafes, and restaurants.  It's a quieter neighborhood, which was perfect for us.  There was construction going on at the time, but Nicole let me know about that ahead of time.  The amenities were great - everything you could need.  The pool was being worked on, so that area was closed off.  When that space is back up and running, it's a great rooftop spot.  They even have a tennis court and Nicole and Simon provide you with rackets.  The bed was really comfortable and the layout of the apartment was perfect for a couple.  There was a day when it was raining, and we enjoyed snuggling up on the comfy couch, drinking tea, reading and watching movies.  They have a selection of movies available.  It seems they also had Netflix, but this was protected through parental controls, so we couldn't access it. It would be nice if there is an option for the renter to use their own account if they already have one, but that is really a minor thing in comparison with all the other great things this place offers.  Highly recommend staying here."
2017-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,20906942,Mia,The place is located right in the central Sydney. Short distance to everything. Everything is great except the room could be much cleaner. There was dust in the bathroom. And there was no dish rack.

There are only 2 toilets for 8 guests. Everyone must try the gelato parlour nearby. Keep a lookout for its door bitch. Haha"
2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,4919014,Ken,"The views from this apartment are simply stunning and they might be the best in Manly.  I highly recommend waking up early to catch a sunrise right from your bed or dining table with a coffee -- it's an unforgettable one.   During the morning, in the direct sunshine, the apartment can get quite warm if you don't utilize the shades properly, so be sure to do so.  
The apartment is in an incredibly convenient location, walking distance to the beach, a ton of shops and restaurants, and most importantly for me, a 5 minute walk to the Manly ferry wharf.  
Jarmo and Terje were incredibly helpful with anything I needed and I'll definitely be back!"
2017-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Roger,"Fantastic location, efficient communication, lovely leafy outlook over Fitzroy square, many eating, supermarket options nearby and public transport availability was very good.

The location is out of this world. Close to good restaurants and bars and a 5 minute walk to the stunning Bondi Beach. 
The apartment is easy to access and comfortable. I would definitely stay here next time I am in Bondi. "
2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Julie,"A beautiful home in a stunning location. Perfectly located close to everything but very tranquil and peaceful. Visited by birds, galahs, cockatoos and lorikeets every morning. The house was so comfortable for 10 of us, so much room and lots of privacy. Couldn’t have asked for a better house for our family reunion. Bailey was very amenable with check in and check out.  We had our grandmother who loved the inclinator, young kids who adored the beach and the wildlife, and adults who enjoyed their evening cocktail on the beautiful balcony watching the sun set.  A perfect house for everyone. Thanks for a memorable stay."

If their was something that I would ask for improvement; it would be to have better towels. One had bleach marks on them and the other was to have a full length mirror. 

Thank you so much for your cafe/ restaurant recommendations. The family loved the boathouse in balmoral. 

Once again, thank you. "
2018-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,21451259,Leanne,Ronda' house was our little home away from home.  The decor was beautiful and the apartment was spotless with everything there that we could possible need.  Ronda was great and went above and beyond leaving beach chairs and umbrella out for us.  The price for such a great location was fantastic for our family of 5.  We will be back.
2017-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Gerben,"Great location, good size apartment for 5 adults. Danny provided a late check out in request. Thanks"
2017-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Helen,"Desiree was the perfect host.  The apartment is just as it is down on the airbnb site.  Desiree answered our many queries and requests super-quickly and she is very approachable and friendly.  The location is really close to all the CBD attractions and public transport.  Desiree added so many extras like a bottle of wine and chocolates to help us celebrate our milestone anniversary. We would highly recommend this listing. Thanks Desiree!

2018-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Rachel,"Great house, great location, great money for value. Highly recommend."
2017-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Richard,This is a great place to stay for a couple visiting Sydney. It is not large but very well equipped with high quality fittings and furnished to a high standard. Kings Cross station is within easy walking distance as are plenty of good eateries and a supermarket.
2019-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,14921505,Emma,Bailey was an outstanding host. Easy to communicate with and the house is amazing. What a spectacular view! Thanks Bailey.
2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Alison,Fantastic place to stay - amazing location - would definitely recommend
2018-04-21T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Vivian,"Amazing location, the apartment was exactly how it described.  Desiree was very responsive and check in was easy.  Highly recommended!"
2014-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Michelle,"Naveen and her husband Tris were exquisite hosts.  We were welcomed by Tris who working in the restaurant biz is a connoisseur of great eats and recommended some rad cafes.  The room was absolutely stunning, you wake up to a beautiful view of the rooftops and city, it makes it hard to want to get out of bed.  You are walking distance to quite a lot and have easy access to the train.  Naveen is super on top of checking in to ensure your needs are met and has great energy.  She invited us for a glass of wine when she arrived home from work and it felt like we were catching up with a friend.  I highly recommend staying here, it was a really lovely experience!  "
2017-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Shaun,"It would be hard to find a better location - you are so close to the beautiful streets of Darlinghurst, a short walk to the heart of the city and Circular Quay after that, just 5 minutes to a train station and you’re surrounded by everything you could possibly want. The house is a gorgeous terrace home styled beautifully. Our favourite part was the chilled sparkling water on tap (!!!). Matthew was an excellent host who did everything we could have asked to make our stay as smooth and enjoyable as possible. Highly recommend!"
2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Emily,"Great location, 40 minute walk to harbour front. Really enjoyed our stay"
2018-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Eun Young,"출장을 왔을 때 공항과 지리적으로 무척 가까운 곳에 위치해 있다.
월리 크릭역에서 한정거장만 가면 시드니 국제공항이 나온다.
단 시티 여행자에게는 좀 거리가 있다.
무척 청결한 숙소 상태에 감동 받았다
편안하게 잘 머물다 간다"
2018-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Sam,"I had a really nice but very short stay.
Arrived quite late & left early so I didn’t manage to meet my hosts but our communication was great & they were so flexible.
The place has so many thoughtful touches to make the stay more convenient. Comfortable bed also.
Just make sure you close the windows when you go to sleep as the airport is not far away."
2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,9815988,Allie,"Pascale was awesome! I got a very bad sunburn and she was so helpful, getting me aloe Vera and coconut oil to help out. She was very attentive and helped us with everything from restaurant recommendations to a place to park our car. The location was perfect; not far from the city but away from the craziness of it all. "
2014-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Carolyn,"Susan was a lovely friendly host, she provided a great breakfast and was very helpful with good restaurants to visit and local directions. The studio was perfect - clean, warm and spacious and a great price. The location in Leichhardt was within easy walking distance to eateries and transport. I'd definitely stay here again. "
2015-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Michelle,"Great little spot, just as described in a beautiful part of Avalon. 
Evelyn was excellent in communicating with us and her partner was extremely welcoming with lots of tips for our stay. We had a car but the shops and main beach were in walking distance. The rooms were very clean and we appreciated the tea, coffee (and wine!) that was provided. I loved spending our last day relaxing by and swimming in the pool, the views from here were spectacular.  Thank you Evelyn for such a fabulous experience, I highly recommend it and would love to return :)"
2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Annelise,"We enjoyed our stay with Shuang, it was so convenient to be close to the airport. Would definitely stay again!"

Very nice apartment in a convenient location to the facilities of Sydney Olympic Park.
Jennifer was very responsive and attentive!"

2015-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Robyn,"Organisation was great. No problems finding the lovely old terrace house or acccessing the key even though it was late Sunday. The room was bright, clean and airy with lovely linen. While the plane noise is a bit annoying the great location and access to trains and restaurants and the good price makes it a great place to stay."

2016-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Antti-Jussi,"MissD provided us with instructions for self-check-in which was easy and clear. The house was clean, everything is labeled, and there are instructions on how to do lots of stuff. The location is top-notch with Newtown's train station and lots of cafés etc. just around the corner. Despite this, the neighborhood is extremely quiet. Only noise you may get is from the other guests if they're not being considerate. Communication with MissD was pleasant and fast. Everything went great and I would recommend staying here."
2018-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,22068048,Mikaylah,Lucy maintains a wonderful property - clean with everything you need and in a quiet area but not too far from town for a night out. Lovely hosts and highly recommend Tree Fern Garden Apartment.
2016-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,8797439,Kristin,"The hosts were really great with communication and kept in touch throughout our stay. The house was incredibly tidy. The house is a short drive from Cronulla beach and shops and restaurants. This a lovely home and definitely not somewhere for those looking to party. It's perfect for a cosy home away from home for families or couples. There's a lovely little garden we liked to eat our dinner in and enjoy the evenings. Fully stocked kitchen and air con was good. The main bathroom is amazing with shower and spa bath. It was lovely for our family to stay here whilst our daughter was treated at Westmead hospital and easy to get onto train into Sydney, go to the beach and go for dinner etc. "
2016-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,1310308,Caroline,"Although the pictures of the apartment were fairly accurate, we were unfortunately disappointed with the apartment. The apartment is in an old building and has been fully refurbished, but the net effect is that the rooms are small and dark with large gaps under all the doors. 
Also there was no wifi, which we were not aware of when we booked, and was disappointing - I think this should be standard for all rentals. 
The apartment was clean - but we did find old food in the fridge and freezer.
Good location - easy walk to shops and ferry."
2017-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,15920870,Christopher S,"This is a very nice clean studio, if like Horse Riding this is your spot, the place is very clean in safe neighborhood, Oliver was very helpful with the check in process, and there many good stuff such as coffee, beer, oatmeal, butter, cleaning stuff, dish washer, washing machine, drying machine etc.. It was A+ stay keep up the good work guys thanks for everything"
2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,18793287,Libby,Very comfortable and clean home.

2018-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,9098095,Damon And Rachael,Margaret and John were lovely and their two dogs friendly and welcoming. The carriage is spotless and beautifully restored! Absolutely loved the tranquility.... great stay and I highly recommend to all Air Bnb travelers!

2018-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Angel,"What can I say.. This was our home for 2 weeks! The apartment is tastefully decorated, clean, spacious and had all the amenities we needed. It is the perfect space for two people. The location is ideal,  in the hustle and bustle of Potts Point. Despite being a busy area we managed to slept through every night without any disruption (maybe we are deep sleepers). Everything we needed was in walking distance, including Kings Cross station which has fantastic links to all the key attractions Sydney has to offer.  

To anyone looking at staying in Sydney, we highly recommend Paul's apartment!"
2017-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,16635022,Chris,"Had a great stay at jess's apartment.
Place was sparkly clean, bed was comfy, pool was nice. Everything is as Jess said in the description. One stop to central station but spent most of my free time neandering newtown and erskineville. 
There is some street noise but it wasnt enough to bother me if you keep the windows shut its fine. This place was really a pleasant surprise after my last air bnb experience. Thanks for having me Jess 10/10 would stay again.

2018-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Ella,"Fantastic location with a very easy and smooth check in. So many great coffee shops close by and just minutes walk from Darling Harbour and the ICC. Great room for a short term stay as it is very basic. There were three of us over five nights and it suited fine, a little bit cramped but it was good for what we needed."
2017-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,16261574,Terrence,Great cafe right downstrairs. Easy and quick communication with jennifer.
2018-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,17438054,Diane,"We stayed at the Granny Flat whilst visiting family in Sydney.  It's not in the centre of Sydney but there are good rail links from Kingsgrove station a short walk from the property.  The accommodation is of the highest quality in terms of furnishings, facilities and cleanliness. It was good to have our own entrance so we could come and go as we please.  George and Lucia have thought of everything you could need away from home including shopping bags, washing powder, toiletries and food cupboard staples such as cooking oil, herbs and pasta.  The welcome gift of a box of chocolates and a fridge stocked with milk and butter was really useful.  There is a small Coles supermarket at the petrol station nearby (right at the end of the road) and there is a Woolworths, plenty of restaurants and smaller shops in Kingsgrove. George is very friendly and willing to help in any way he can during your stay.  Would definitely recommend and we will use again."
2018-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Jin Jack,"Great place, clean and near to airport! It would only take you 10mins to/from her place. Modern design, with a smart TV (need your own nexflix ID) which does add value to the whole experience."
2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Ryan,"I rented this property for several special guests in Australia on business. Rachel was an ideal host and extremely hospitable to us. 

The property is a elegant modern home with a beautiful decor. We were 15 minutes from the centre of Sydney and enjoyed the secluded nature of this property. Only 15 minutes from the beautiful Taronga Zoo and a local Beach. 

The stunning environment that was well heated on cold days but bright and warm on the sunny days was a great bonus as well as a gorgeous piano in the lounge room.

We would recommend this to any AirBnB users who want a special Sydney experience."

2018-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Cameron,"Very responsive and helpful host. Apartment and building are vintage - a little rough around the edges, but clean, comfy, and nice to come home to at the end of the day. Building is safe (front door key access). 

Note - there is no freezer, and bedroom does not have a door (a thick curtain instead). 

Also - the bedroom is well circulated by the breeze if you leave the window open, but light sleepers might be interrupted by street noise (window opens to an alley between this building and the next). 

Small desk fan in lounge room works just fine, but not sure how building would be in summer (no a/c). 

Bathroom very well stocked with toiletries, and bedroom has handy shelving/hangers for clothes. A 10 minute leisurely walk straight to Oxford St. 

Good value for money given the location. A cute retro apartment."

and an air conditioner in the kitchen. But the air conditioner broke down and I couldn't use it.
But the rest of the facility was fine."
2017-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Judith,"House is well situated in a ""Soho"" type fashionable area of the city - with easy access to great restaurants, Hyde Park and other areas of interest. House has been renovated with high end appliances and excellent showers - we only used two floors but note that there are stairs leading to both upstairs and downstairs bedrooms. Beds are very comfortable and there's a lovely small terrace off the kitchen.There's a parking garage space available; directions just need to be clearer."

When arriving read instructions slowly and purposely and all will be fine. Gabbie communicated quickly when I was a little  confused with instructions. 

We came into Sydney from overseas and were exhausted after 24 plus hours in transit and we ended up loving the place and location. Definitely get a good Sydney vibe in this area."

2018-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,24460964,Ali,"本次旅行最不满意的住宿,地理位置就不错,走5分钟去到中心站,楼下有便利店7仔,中心站出站有一家小型超市,可以满足简单需求,到世界购物中心要走10分钟｡但住宿条件不行,房间的灯很多不亮,整间屋只有卫生间有卷纸,厅里没有提供纸巾｡卫生间的干衣机里有很多衣物｡去时遇见一位女士开门交钥匙,她要求我们进屋要脱鞋,不可以穿鞋踩整屋地毯,觉得不太合理｡我订2天,第二天那位女士10点多过来敲门,进来后到处看,好像是检查我们似的｡wifi退房那天一醒来就上不了,估计改了密码｡太多不满意了,除了靠近中心站,其他选择需慎重｡"
2014-07-14T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Doreen,"We were very comfortable and cosy in Susan's garden studio. Firstly because Susan is a delightful host - she's warm and welcoming and helpful and generous! I have some allergies, and Susan was so helpful in making everything work for me. The studio itself is clean, nicely presented, self contained, quiet and has everything you need to make it a great base for a few days in Sydney. There's an ensuite bathroom, sitting area, TV, tea-making facilities. Glad it was cosy, as Sydney turned on some chilly days (which we thought we'd left behind in Canberra!). Leichardt is close to the city and an interesting area with plenty of eating places nearby. All in all a great place to stay. Thanks Susan!"
2016-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Domenic,"Thanks for taking us in on such short notice! We stayed just one night and it was a great experience overall. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean. Naveen is extremely organised and thoughtful, providing a number of things for guests to use from bathrobes to a beach bag to quality bath products to a candle and mood lighting. A unique room with floor to ceiling window overlooking the street. And a gym, sauna and pool! (Be sure to check out the view from the pool). Naveen was flexible with our requests, including a late check-out, and check-in was easy - they have a concierge desk where we picked up the keys as they were not home when we checked in. Tristan is also a great guy. One thing to beware of is that you may be tempted to steal their dog Felix - friendliest dog ever! Only thing to note is that the downstairs kitchen, living area and balcony are off limits so it's just the room and bathroom - kind of like a hotel set-up, but the location is extremely convenient with lots of cafes, supermarket, bakery, juice place etc. all very close by :-)"
2016-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Edward,A perfect place to stay while in Sydney. It was a cozy and comfortable spot to rest and see the sights. The listing was accurate to what we found and they were the best to work with when it comes to arrival. I would highly recommend staying here.

Overall, pristine listing and great host!"
2016-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,15312988,Sabrina,I loved that the place was in a quiet area and close to Coogee Beach. From there you can do the Coast Walk to Bondi Beach which is amazing.
2018-11-05T05:00:00.000Z,20962081,Debbie,"Location is great and the massage chair was a bonus. But the second bedroom is very very small and the shower door in the en-suite does not shut properly and water goes everywhere. 
Min’s communication was fine and it was easy to gain access.
There also seemed to be some question about the “legality” of an Air BnB in that complex."

2016-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Rosie,"Paul's place is super close to the train station and easily accessible to uber and taxi pick ups. Parking is a struggle so wouldn't recommend taking your car. It's a cozy place perfect for 2. Nice small kitchen to prepare meals. Dining table, lounge and study spaces available. Noisy street with trucks at times so may not be good for couples with children or light sleepers. Overall we rated this place very highly! Service was professional and so helpful. Thanks Paul for a great weekend "
2016-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Deon,"Dont think you can ask for more from the host and the accommodation. No excuses here. If you are creative you can make almost anything with the kitchenette. Perfect location
. All the privacy you need and conversation (mostly by text) but the host is always happy to pop in. 
Bed is comfortable and all the netflix ypu can have at your leisure. Go for it!"
2018-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,23357535,Chanette,"Very nice, clean and spacious apartment in a great location. Check-in was a bit difficult because I never received the instructions (not sure if it was the Airbnb app or what) and Johannes was unfortunately out of reach. But after a few hours we finally managed to get it. There was no light in the bathroom when we arrived (not sure how the cleaner managed to clean without any light) so we had to change the light bulb ourselves.
Besides that the stay was very nice and the apartment is lovely."

Richard is a great host and easy to contact when organising the trip. We first came to know of this place when friends stayed here last Easter and we were at another place, we are so happy to have found a chance to show my parents (from Canada) this amazing location. Loved the treehouse for my parents. Thanks for having us Richard. We WILL be back!! "

2018-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Paul,A beautiful and simple space in a great area. One of those places that I'm tempted to give just one star so that we can keep it to ourselves!
2018-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,12655535,Kamie,"Sabrina's apartment is really well appointed and had many thoughtful touches, like the coffee machine. The provided carpark is really low, don't try and fit a larger car or 4wd in there. Regardless, Sabrina's hospitality was great and the place was clean and welcoming."
2017-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,12370710,Simone,"Maria and Jerome's place was absolutely fantastic... the location was perfect for our long weekend trip away. Close to fabulous cafes, restaurants and the most beautiful beaches.

The window seat is to die for... the activity outside in the water of swimming, surf skis and divers is very cool to watch before starting the day's activities.

I didn't get to meet Maria but her commutation and friendliness was amazing, she gave us tips of where to go, where to eat and things to do.

We met Jerome half way through our stay and he was so lovely and made us feel very welcome.

Would absolutely recommend... I want to go back already!"
2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,19508741,Juergen,This is a little gem at the Northern Beaches. Tess and Rod were the most welcoming hosts and the little studio exceeded our expectations. From the moment we arrived until we departed we felt at home (and) away from home. (pardon the punt). Loved following the suggestions of the local pub and restaurants. Tess' decoration with personal touches and home made little gestures were really appreciated.  Great private outdoor area amongst lush gardens to soak in the afternoon sun. We couldn't have asked for more. Highly recommended.
2017-06-05T04:00:00.000Z,18082902,Jessica,Cute apartment in a nice location. Cedric has really thought about everything you need for a short stay! Well styled and clean. Apple TV was great. Recommend heading down to see the Tramsheds in Harold Park.

2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,8121226,Nick,"My partner and I had a fantastic stay in Jenny's apartment. It’s the perfect base for exploring Sydney. Awesome neighborhood with lots of character. Make sure to check out the weekend markets across the road. While the building is a little rustic, the apartment has been renovated extremely well. Modern, clean, every amenity you’d need. As the description states - it’s a pied-à-terre. But we found it a-ok for a couple. Also communication was fantastic. Would definitely stay there again."
2016-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Gareth,Lovely little place 5-10 minute taxi ride to the International or domestic airport. 10 minute walk to Wolli Creek train station which is perfect to get to the city centre.

Belinda was easy to deal with, efficient and friendly. This weekend idyll was everything I hoped it would be and more. Peaceful, easy to arrange, gorgeous location, beautiful accommodation, friendly hosts. Can't wait to book again! "
2017-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,18083735,Chandini,It was a pleasure to stay in Greg's beautifully kept cabin. It overlooked a lovely garden and we enjoyed sitting in the little patio. We enjoyed the fruit and yoghurt and the home made marmalade and cereals mix. Wish the cat was less aloof!
2018-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,15889399,Clive,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Steven's place. It was clean, airy and sunny with beautiful decor and a very comfortable bed. Our hosts were delightful. Two things to note, parking can be a bit tricky (though we succeeded each time) and the street is under the flight path so you might have a 6.00 am wakeup call that makes you want to duck. We are used to Sydney flight traffic control so we will be going back for another stay."
2018-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,20578419,英,"Wi-Fi根本不能使用,和房东沟通后没有任何解决措施,公寓比较旧床品有一股汗味,是一室一卫用隔板改的,墙没有封,私密性很差,窗外就是在建的楼房与图片不符,虽然公寓的位置不错,交通便利,但是性价比较低,wouldn't recommend."

2017-11-05T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Briony,"We experienced positives and negatives during our stay. 
First the positives- communication between ourselves and the host was prompt and very helpful, the check in was very easy and the host met us at the arranged time to check us in and explain the things we needed to know, the apartment is located close to shops and there is an IGA just down the road. The apartment is also close to a bus station, the ferry and train station so getting into the city was very easy. The apartment was cosy with lovely views over the parramatta river. It was also well equipped with everything we needed. 
As for the negatives, unfortunately there were some cleanliness issues. When we arrived we found some dirty dishes, dirty towels and face washers in the bathroom and the shower was quite dirty. We were concerned that the sheets on the bed had not been changed after the previous guest so we contacted the host who confirmed that they had not been changed so we had to strip the bed, wash all bedding and remake the bed. Thankfully the host did respond to our questions promptly and truthfully and provided info about where to find clean bedding - however when staying in an air BnB I don't think it's too much to ask that the sheets are clean. We had to wait up until about midnight for the bedding to dry before we could go to sleep. 
All in all, good location, good communication, nice little apartment but a few minor cleanliness issues"
2018-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,22346270,Denise,"Sam and Penny were the perfect hosts they really made us feel so safe and taken care of. We were traveling from Ireland and they couldn't have made us feel more at home. It was like home from home. They were so friendly and generous and even entertained us a few nights, Penny cooked some traditional Chinese food for us which was to die for and offered great advice on local transport, places to go around Sydney etc and it was so lovely getting to know them. We had all the essentials wifi, TV and more, it was clean and very cosy and the bed was super comfortable! We simply loved it. It's not often you meet people as genuine and caring as Sam nothing was too much trouble for them. They were the definition of Superhosts!!. Thanks Sam & Penny"

2014-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Payton,"Adorable home owned by an amazing person! 

My mother and me went to Sydney standby and had problems from the very start! We arrived 6.5 hours before check in and Susan was amazing and accommodating, letting us go in early and cleaning up the room a bit. She then helped take us into town and buy a train pass. It was amazing for a first day. Susan is the most helpful person I have ever met and she actually cares that you have an amazing stay in her house. She helps every step of the way and doesnt let anyone fall through any vacation cracks; whether it is getting lost, grocery shopping, buying dinner, or car troubles Susan refuses to let you make a wrong decision and will stick by you through the worst of them! If I ever went back to Sydney, she is the person I would want to be with!"
2014-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,794910,Angelika,Great host. My friend and I felt very comfortable during our stay.   Gavin had an answer to all our touristical questions and it was nice to chat about other topics anyways. Loved the central location.

Great location in regards to transport (very close to the Kings Cross train station), cafes, supermarket etc.  We felt safe aswell.

One of the things that we struggled was the use of stove. The stove was locked for the safety reason and we had to unlock it, which we didn’t know how to. 
But the response by the host was really quick and they came and helped us!"

2014-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Maya,"My stay at The Garden Studio (4 nights) was thoroughly enjoyed and a great experience... Why I'd recommend you stay:

* Lots of privacy, with your own entrance...

* Cath is a very generous, understanding, and thoughtful host, and easy to contact. We particularly loved her guides about where to eat in the local area.

* TGS is very well located in the central suburb of Marrickville - easy to get into the CBD/Newtown/Surry Hills, and if you drive like me, never any complications with street parking!

* The studio was meticulous, and very well stocked - Cath filled the fridge/kitchen with nearly everything you'd need... The variety of teas and delicious homemade cookies were mostly appreciated, and I'm sure most Airbnb users are interested in an espresso machine, which was also available!

* The shower in this place is truly amazing.

All in all, if you don't mind a smaller place, this is the place for you - we found it worked well for 2 people. Thank you again Cath. :-)"

All communication was prompt and clear and the apartment was well equipped with everything you could need and want. Location was brilliant - beach across the road and ocean pool, walks, cafes and restaurants within walking distance. We had a hire car but public transport stopped right outside and was easy to use for access to the city. Our girls (7yr, 11yrs) had a great time and want to always stay here (we have stayed in the city every other time in the past) but this was a lovely change of pace. Fred offered use of kayaks and was extremely hospitable with local knowledge and suggestions. Bernadette left fresh orange juice and chocolate slice when we arrived and cereal and tea/coffee for breakfast. Apartment has new kitchen and there was nothing extra we needed that was not provided.  Thank you so much for a brilliant stay - we will definitely stay again!!!"

2017-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Will And Jo,"Best Airbnb stay ever! We like to think that we're pretty good hosts, but we can learn from Susan and Greg. The place is gorgeous, at the back of an enchanted garden (with a private entrance), but totally private. Perfectly set up and equipped for a couple. But it was the personal touches that made it so great: Coffee, tea, milk, juice, bagels delivered to our door, and Susan and Greg were really kind and friendly while giving us all the space we needed. The location is also perfect. Beautifully quiet street, a couple of minutes from a great cafe (Three Blue Ducks) and a fabulous fish restaurant (Moxhe - don't miss out on this one!). Bronte Beach and the gorgeous Bronte-Bondi walk less than ten minutes away on foot. Can't wait to be back for another lovely stay. "

  Thea was so kind that I had a problem with the wheel of my suitcase and couldn't bring it to cairns. With Thea's permission she was willing to let me deposit the suitcase in her (Website hidden by Airbnb) helped me a lot. It allowed me to travel light in cairns. Thank you very much.

Was the perfect base for visiting friends in Bronte. The room was clean, comfortable and the entire place was nicely styled and tidy too. His flatmate was also very nice and helpful. Fully enjoyed my stay. Woke up to the sounds of the birds in the morning :)"

2016-09-18T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Colleen,"The unit is pretty and had some nice conveniences. There was a lot of other conveniences in the kitchen that was so much better than a hotel. That was thoughtful. It looked bigger to me in the photos and fresher. Maybe more current photos would represent it better. It is located close to everything which was nice and the kitchen had everything we needed. The dishwater was great and it had plenty of nice extras needed to prepare a meal.....lThank You for that. It is a drafty place and there seemed to be a lot of noise of cars driving by.( seems the street has become a busy pass thru)there was lots of banging noises in the morning that we solved by putting towels over the doorway to stop that( one of the bedrooms has doors that lead to an semi exposed sitting area that was blowing a draft if the doors were closed it kept banging REALLY loud, after the towel was placed on top it stopped the constant open and closing of it. And one of the brass window closures was also banging all night from the breeze, I moved it to stop that but it woke us. I wanted to use the Jacuzzi tub but tried three times and the hot water ran out before it could be filled to level of jets.Maybe a bigger hot water tank might solve that. Bathroom was really good otherwise, quite gorgeous and towels were great. Liked the hand held shower head and shower was plenty of room. The beds weren't as large as I thought, I believe they were full size instead of Queen or King which I expected for the master suite. The bedding and Dooners as well as pillows were great. The chairs downstairs had blankets on them which seemed like a great touch. There was major rips and not much chair support left in them under the blankets( FYI ) all in all it was a nice stay. I just expected a bit more for the money paid. Slightly awkward floor plan. Wanted the four of us to chill out to watch a movie it just was laid out awkward downstairs. Just thought that area was bigger . Laundry was good, never used the drier. Dishwasher is a plus and it worked great.check in and out was seamless. The key in the door thing was weird. You had to leave the key in the door or you couldn't leave. This was awkward when we went for a walk and left kids at home we couldn't take keys with us because they could get out otherwise. Parking spot was good. Back yard looked nice but the fountain was full of old water that was green. Verandah was lovely. There are motion sensors in three of the rooms which felt a little weird to me when they went on but must be a security thing. I know we hadn't put the security on. Electricity didn't work in the bedrooms..."
2018-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Haylea,"Great sized apartment for central Sydney and well situated whether you are in the city for business or leisure.
Communication with the owner was timely and effective and check in / check it was no hassle which is always appreciated."
2016-11-05T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Celina,"We had an amazing time staying at Wayne and Kate's beautiful home. The location could not have been better, if what you're wanting is Sydney beach living. While our first choice was to stay directly on Bondi, much to our surprise this Tamarama location was so much better and away from the chaos on Bondi. 

This three bedroom home was clean and looked exactly like the pictures. Will definitely book this place again if I ever find myself in Sydney."
2016-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Luke,"Heidi's place was absolutely amazing. The house was immaculate with plenty of space for the 3 other couples we had staying with us. The house itself had everything you could possibly want for a weekend in Sydney.
The location was absolutely incredible close to Carlton train station and not to far from the Airport.
A big backyard with plenty of space for kids to run around an amazing pool which was incredible. 
I will be recommending Heidi's place to all my family and friends and will not hesitate to contact Heidi for any further trips to Sydney to see if her place is available.   "
2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,21612701,Camille,"Tout était parfait, la localisation, la vue, l’appartement décoré avec goût, la ville etc... je recommande sans aucune hésitation cet appartement. De plus Kinga est une hôte très sympathique et arrangeante. J’espère pouvoir y revenir un jour !"
2016-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,4499095,Jude,"We had a lovely time during our stay in Sydney. Dino’s apartment is in a nice quiet neighbourhood and central position. Its an easy walk to Kings cross Train station and restaurants. Wooloomooloo is also a easy walk away.

We were welcomed by Rick, a friend of Dino, who is taken care of the apartment when he is away. Communication was great from both of them and we felt well taken care of. 

I can recommed a good coffee from  “ Poppies “ on the corner owned by a lovely Greek family always served with a smile and a chat!
Many thanks Dino"
2015-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,5712086,Nicole,"Although I did not meet Rachel in person, she was a fantastic host and great communicator, who gave excellent directions and ensured that we found her property easily.  Keys were left as agreed and any questions were answered quickly.  We found the property was light filled, airy, beautiful and as pictured, including special touches like fresh roses on the dining room table.  The beds were comfortable and french provincial kitchen well equipped.  My daughter especially liked playing the piano.  The Mosman location was a treat as it was only a quick 800m walk to shops, including a supermarket and great take-away food / restaurants nearby were plentiful.  The beach at Balmoral (3 minute drive or 20 minute walk) was gorgeous, a short drive (2 minute) to Mosman Wharf had us on the ferry into Circular Quay with those amazing harbour views and Taronga Zoo was a 3 minute drive away too.   My husband travels to Sydney CBD frequently for work so I chose Rachels property in Mosman so he could experience Sydney like a local and how he has never seen it before.   Now he tells me he could live there!   Rachel's place ticked all our boxes for a family road trip to Sydney with two, almost teenage children in tow.  I would definitely recommend to others "
2016-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Molly,Great stay! Sam kindly allowed us to check out a few hours later which was very lovely. Sam was always prompt and friendly with communication. We would stay here again!

2017-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Andrew,"You don't need to be a train buff to really enjoy the experience of the carriage and surrounds. But it's even better if you are. :)
It is easy to get lost in the romance of train travel as it was. A perfect place for a romantic getaway; if only I was young again.
Highly recommended and I will be returning as it is a perfect place to relax but still be close to the big smoke."
2016-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,10423504,Tyson,Coordinating the check-in time and receiving the keys was effortless and smooth which is always much appreciated. The apartment is a few minutes walk from the beaches and the shops. There is also a cafe at the end of the block which was even more convenient for morning coffee/breakfast. Would definitely recommend!

It's close to the train station and the train only takes ten minutes to the city center. The cabin was very clean and beautiful. Steven and Peta were nice and helpful hosts with two lovely children. 

Thank you Steven, Peta, Max and Zara, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this cabin to everyone who visits Sydney for a few days and wants to stay close to the center. 

Best regards,
Maja and Katja"
2016-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,12117514,David,This property is next to a busy road with a landing walkway the other side. Very hot with no a/c or fan. A very basic apartment with a wooden create as a coffee table!

2018-10-04T04:00:00.000Z,16651655,Kate,"Mostly was as described, clean, and we had a good stay. We were disappointed though as a big part of our decision to stay here was based on the ability to do washing and when we arrived the washing machine was broken. It would have been great if Steven had communicated this to us in advance as we would have stayed elsewhere."
2015-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Maximilian,"We had such a wonderful and memorable time at Susan's cosy Studio in Bronte Beach. Susan and Greg gave us a very warm welcome and spoiled us throughout the entire stay. The Studio, which is seperated from the main house, provides everything you would need and makes you feel home from the very beginning. It is perfectly located if you like to combine your visit to Syndey with a day, or two, at one of the city's most beautiful beaches. We hope to be back soon!"

It is located in a leafy suburb close to the CBD & right around the corner from restaurants, cafes and bars. Bill's place is the perfect base from which to explore Sydney and is a pleasure to come home to after a day out. The bedrooms are spacious, the kitchen is newly renovated and contains everything you need, and the living area is homely and comfortable. Bill's home is furnished with interesting and unique artworks and antiques, and the courtyard is a relaxing spot to enjoy a morning coffee or a glass of wine in the evening. Highly recommended!"

Tam thought of everything. The bed was a dream to sleep on, the decor was great and the place smelt amazing. It was light, airy and very clean! I would definitely return to stay if I'm in Sydney again. Tam was an amazing host, very understanding and accomodating when I hit a travel snag.

We were directly across the road from Bondi Beach and the apartment was incredibly clean and comfortable.

She is so considerate to all what we need and she is always smiling and humorous! If you feel lonely while travel alone, it's also the best choice for you. I even have chance to the  food Yang Dajie make, since you can refuse since she is so warm and want to share with you. This is the best host I ever met! Though I left, I miss this place and the peple who stay here. I think I already established a kind of connection with here.

The true is that JArmo and his wife were amazing, I am for sure going to stay there many times from now on... If you are looking for the perfect place... Dont think twice, this is the place, and also the price is more than fair... Believe me, around the neighborhood you are not going to find a better place and not even a better price...
Thanks a lot mr. Jarmo, we hope to see you very soon :)"
2016-10-04T04:00:00.000Z,5469086,Zak,My partner and I stayed at this apartment for 10 nights in September.  The place was very very clean and homely and the owner made a lot of effort to ensure we were comfortable and had all the relevant info needed.  Only negative I would say was that it was more of a studio than a 1 bed so felt quite small with 2 of us. It would also have benefited from a plug in heater of some sort as it was very cold at night.   Other than that we very much enjoyed our stay.
2013-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,1098211,Natasha,"Serena's apartment is tidy, comfy, attractively decorated and perfectly located just steps from bars, pubs and restaurants. She left us gift basket of jam, fruit, oatmeal and buns that was much appreciated. We could hear music from a nearby club or bar so would advise earplugs but we slept well. Great hot shower! We would definitely recommend it to others. Thanks!"
2016-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,9612902,Kelly,"We loved our stay at this delightful house. The house was perfect for our family holiday of 3 couples and 5 children. The backyard space and amenities were so well suited to our needs, our children happily played outside every waking hour. 
The kitchen is well equipped, with indoor and outdoor dining options. The bathrooms were modern and lovely. The bedrooms were clean and comfortable and spacious for those needing a portacot. 
Heidi is a lovely, accommodating and well organised host and made our stay very comfortable and easy. 
We will most definitely rebook here in the future. "
2017-07-27T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Prell,"The room is very clean. Location is very close to the airport. 15 mins walk to arncliff rail station. A quite neighborhood. Everything are well provided, utensils, etc. Washing machine is a plus. The detergent is provided as well, so doing your laundry is not a problem. "
2018-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,2889953,Bay,The host canceled this reservation 149 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

깨끗한 침구와 집 내부가 매우 청결하였으면 늦은 체크인 역시나 매우 친절하게 맞아주었습니다!!
Thank you Lina!!"
2015-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Ants,"It was lovely staying at Susan's studio. Very peaceful, super comfortable and so close to public transport. Susan was very welcoming and so easy to talk to - I was really made to feel at home.  I was able to cook in Susan's kitchen and appreciated having fridge space to use too. The little deck off the kitchen was a perfect space for breakfast. Thanks so much Susan! "
2016-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Carolyn,"The host made us feel welcome by providing all the amenities of home, and the listing was exactly as described.  Beautiful view from the balcony... nice place!"
2017-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Fiona,Absolutely wonderful apartment in a perfect location! We had a fantastic stay in the Eagle's Nest and Hugo was so accommodating with checking in/out times. It's a lovely apartment with breathtaking views and walkable to all the sights. If we're in ever in Sydney again we'll definitely be back.
2018-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,27009904,Hugo,"We stayed at Tim & Mel’s for 4 nights. The place was spotless and well located near  Green Square station. 

Check in was very easy and the hosts were quick to respond when contacted. 

We initially had a slight issue with the camera in the living area and where it was placed. After discussing this with Tim & Mel they agreed to move it to a more agreeable place within the room. We’d like to add that we were happy with the host’s response. 

All in all, a very good stay in a well located apartment."
2018-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Ross,"This is a nice apartment in a convenient location, easy to get around, with plenty of restaurants and services nearby. It’s in a nightlife zone with a few adult shops and backpacker hostels around too, but noise and people were never a problem at all.  In fact I think it’s why there are so many neat coffee shops and diverse restaurants nearby. Be sure to eat at Pizza Boccone just behind the building, it’s the best pizza we have EVER eaten, anywhere!  

David set up the futon couch as a second bed for my son, very nice!  And he was super helpful getting us settled in and explaining how best to get around the area. Thanks David! We’d happily stay here again."

2017-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Clara,"Linda’s place is comfortable and convenient. It was nice that the bedroom area on the second floor was separated from the living area. Also, there was an extra bathroom downstairs with toilet and sink. The airbnb was close to plenty of restaurants and cafes as well as the Central Park and Broadway malls. You can go to the city center by train from the Redfern station, which is only 5 minutes away from the apartment. Check-in and check-out were easy. Although we didn’t get to meet Linda in person, she was always available on text and was a wonderful host :)"
2017-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Therese,"Hernan was a great host.
He is very warm, friendly, helpful and easy to talk to.

Prior to my stay, he provided me with clear instructions on how to find and access his apartment.  

Great location and I would not hesitate in staying there again in the future."

2018-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Cath,Great place to stay. We were 5 adults and had plenty of room. Location in the city is perfect. Danny’s brother checked us in and he covered everything. Parking very close by at a Wilson car park. Lovely view of Darling Harbour from the balcony.
2018-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Claire,Amazing location right next to the Tamarama beach. The view is fantastic and the hosts have been great with all our questions! Really enjoyed our stay and can’t recommend it more :)

Thanks very to Oli for the wonderful hosting. He's very quick and efficient for communication and very supportive with our requests. It made us a pleasant holiday.

Greg的小屋给我们留下很深的印象｡小屋子距离chatswood 火车站很近｡附近还有快速公交,10多分钟到市中心｡房东很热情,提前跟我们确定到达时间｡小屋不大,但很干净｡花园很美,有个金鱼池,主人还有只可爱的猫,屋主非常热心,经常问询是否需要帮忙的,给了很多信息｡小屋性价比也不错｡推荐!"
2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,16193945,Imogen,"Easy and friendly communication throughout our stay here. Place was cute and although surrounded by other houses it was nestled amongst trees so it was quite secluded. A rustic but well maintained 1 bedroom cottage well prepared for airbnb guests. About a 20 minute walk to Avalon beach and local shops, restaurants etc. Very steep driveway :)"
2014-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,2900140,Nicki,"We had a wonderful time at Neiafu! Everything was so easy and well-organised, clean and tidy, Anne and her husband were very friendly and welcoming and they even put out some food for us and gave us some great advice about the area.

2016-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Angel,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I feel so fortunate to have stayed at Angela's property.  Angela is extremely responsive and friendly, and the studio is just perfect - so clean and spacious with everything I needed.  Staying here was a breeze :). She even provided me with chocolates and grocery items when she found out this was an extended stay!  I would definitely love to stay here again and highly recommend Angela and the property to everyone visiting Sydney :)"

The apartment itself is a small but comfortable studio with beautiful views of the city. It's located close to Oxford St with access to public transport if needed. Only a short walk to Darlinghurst and the city. Also, a Woolworths Metro within 200m. 
Loved the place and would stay again.

2018-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,19508741,Suhela,"Amazing location, just up the road from the Newport Hotel, but also walking distance into town if you're headed that way. Very much enjoyed our stay at Tess and Rod's."
2013-10-04T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Shelli,"Wayne and Kate were wonderful to deal with, quick responses in the lead-up to our stay and comprehensive instructions on how to get the key when we arrived. As soon as we walked in we knew we were in for a lovely stay. The view is magnificent and the apartment is spacious and airy, and well-represented in the photos on the website. The kids loved the big TV which meant more time on the deck for us! Great walks and easy parking which is not easy to come by in Sydney. Would thoroughly recommend this place."
2017-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,15960997,Joy,"Great location, cafes and bars and stores nearby. 
Spacious room. 
Lovely host, always helpful and super polite!
Highly recommended!!!"

We really appreciated the little things that Justine did for us to make our stay easy and enjoyable.   Thank you Justine and we look forward to coming again in the near future.
Cheers Anke"
2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,24735200,Kev,I had a fantastic stay at Natalia's apartment. Great location and great host. I highly recommend it!
2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Ignas,"It's a good place at great hipster-ish neighborhood for a decent price. The whole vibe it gives out is much like communal youth apartment so if you're into that, you'll like the place. There were some cleanliness issues with bugs but it was generally okay. As far as the room goes you get what you see in the picture. :)
P.S. The complimentary breakfast (cereal) is quite good and a nice addition."
2019-01-30T05:00:00.000Z,23650892,Tara,"Great location and very easy to check in and out, concierge were great.
The place is ideally located in Darlinghurst with shops and restaurants right outside, Coles and Woolworths are within a couple minute walk.
It was great to have a place with a fully equipped kitchen and plentiful space, with the two levels and set up you don’t feel cramped and can comfortably hang out in the apartment without being on top of each other. Most other hotels in Sydney don’t have that luxury.
Thanks for having us!"
2014-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Dawn,"Arnie was very helpful but also left us to come and go as we pleased and to use the facilities in his lovely home.  He gave us good recommendations of places to visit and pubs to eat in.

It was a great location and neighbourhood with lots of shops, cafes and restaurants within walking distance.  It was also near a bus route, which meant that the city centre and beaches were easily accessible.

It was our first AirBnB experience and we would recommend it."
2017-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,13595339,Lillian & Peter,"Stayed here for a short business trip to Sydney. A very cosy apartment, very clean and as described. The bed is super comfortable and the fittings and fixtures are excellent (great shower). I love the location as its so close to Kings Cross and to central Sydney itself. Lots of places to eat, supermarket just down the road and the apartment building is quiet and well maintained. If you have a car, you just need some forward planning and research as parking can be an issue. It only took me one night to find the right spots along the streets though, and there is a pay as you go car park nearby. All in all, a great place to stay and will certainly be on my list for any future trips."
2018-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,26474245,Teri,"This place is set up really well for a family. Perfect beach decor and having a washer/dryer combo was a definite plus. Lots of places to eat nearby and the beach is so close. Everything you need, including a grocery store right up the street. Leigh was an incredibly helpful host. Thank you for the stay!!"
2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,13299549,Beth,"Mixed bag on this stay but overall positive.  Great location near Circular Quay and the apartment is comfortable.  However, I was shocked to find out that I was required to supply my own toilet paper, trash bags, etc etc., so take note.  A few single use items were supplied but having to go to the store and buy my own toilet paper was ridiculous and no forewarning was provided.  There were no instructions on how to use the TV so weren't able to watch it. The hot water in the shower was hit and miss and there were no face cloths.  "

2016-01-31T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Alicia,"Apartment was stunning, exactly like the photos. Very warm and welcoming and the little touches made my stay feel like home. 
Unfortunately there was a lot of construction work across the road, but as I was up for work during week, did not impact my stay. 
Nicole and Simon were both great hosts, particularly as I had to call them to assist. Great communication and very hospitable.

I stayed 2 nights with my parents, the house keeper Wendy is nice and easy to communicate. For deep sleepers, it's not noisy at all. The only thing is I saw a cockroach in the smaller room and killed it. Overall is quite nice!"

Laura is a very nice lady and helpful. I love the way she decorated her home and with all the convenient she provided at home just perfect. You need nothing except your luggage :) 

Highly recommended! 

I will book again for any of my friends and family for the next trip!"
2015-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Jhun Yann,It was a very welcoming and comfortable stay. The location is pretty convenient for us to travel around Sydney City by buses or trains. The room is clean and tidy and   Equipped with everything that we need during the stay. Thanks for providing us with this awesome stay and hope to see you again!
2017-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,8277472,Nicole,"Well, this was by far the best Accommodation experience I have ever had, after travelling 5 months around the world, that's a big call. It was really easy to get from the Airport and back and forth to the ICC at Darling Harbour. They were the most hospitable hosts you could wish to have, your own bathroom and comfy bed with plenty of room to move. So many restaurants to choose from and a huge Shopping Centre just up the road. I almost cried when I had to leave. Thank you sooo much.  "
2018-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,888107,H Jenshen,"Nice room in a convenient location just outside the city. About 15 minutes bus ride to the heart of the city, very convenient. Also, just a couple minutes walk will lead you into a few Annandale shops, consisting of cafes, bakeries and a convenience store. 

The room was clean and also cozy. No big complaints. Only one would be that the house is old, with creeking floors everytime someone walks by, so if you are a light sleeper/ gets annoyed by noises, this could be a concern.

Wyatt and Julie were also friendly, sharing with us about Sydney's hangout spots and some local insights on them. They were also very hospitable during our stay, constantly checking if we were all good during our time there.

Overall happy with the place!"

2015-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Jessica,"Naveen and Tris have a well-appointed place in the cozy Sydney neighborhood of Darlinghurst. The area is bustling with cafes and well-rated restaurants. Naveen and Tris were attentive hosts even though they had just come home from a long trip themselves. They went out of their way to interact with us and we even stayed up late one night chatting over wine. 

The location is very close to King's Cross station which makes it a breeze to do day trips (we did Blue Mountains and Bondi) and get to/from the airport. However, the only con is that there is no direct subway line or bus to Circular Quay/the Rocks area. Walking 20min, you're in the city, but it probably took us 30-40 min to walk to the Rocks area.

Overall it was a pleasant stay!"
2018-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,17944310,Kelsey,"Very clean and modern space!  Comfy bed, nice porch. They were quick to respond to our request to book which was so very helpful. Thank you for a nice stay."

Was abit of a last minute thing for us but that was no problem with them
There was great communication on how to find the place
A leaflet of places to eat and things to do ect

Would recomend"
2018-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Bret,"Millie's ""Shoebox"" would be great for one person or a couple looking for a value minded stay in Sydney with great view, clean accommodations, close to Milsons Point train station and even closer to the North Sydney ferry stop that takes you across the harbor to downtown Sydney and the Opera House.  You walk up the road a bit to North downtown and that's where you can buy all the groceries, beer and wine you need for your stay at a pretty good deal.  The views out the balcony are awesome - yes Millie's place is on the corner of a pretty busy stretch of street during commuter hours - but it adds to the charm; watching everyone scurry off to work while you're on holiday!  And the evening time was great for the balcony as you can open up the door, grab a glass of wine and enjoy the views of the Harbour Bridge at evening and sunset.  The bed was very comfortable for one, the kitchen was well stocked, the building itself seemed very safe and secure and it had a nice little counter w/ two bar stools that you can set up your IPad for the day/morning, have breakfast and get some work done before heading out onto your adventures.  You can tell I'm a big fan - as I'm an airbnb Superhost myself back in the USA.  The best part ... Millie's customer service and communication.  I cam a long way from SFO airport landing at 6:30 am after a long flight and Millie went out of her way to make sure I could either do an early check in or bag drop - and she was awesome during my visit with places to check out, etc.  She's a Superhost for a reason.  I've traveled around the world and have been to many countries and continents staying at various Airbnb units - Millie's was right up there for location, value, services, views and cleanliness.

2018-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Olivia,"What a property - it's a great space and totally unique! Perfect for a large group of friends having a getaway or getting prepared for a special event, as we were! 
One annoyance is having to pay extra for parking on the driveway."
2016-01-30T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Pauline,Susan was a wonderful host and very helpful. Her little cottage was exactly as described and gave us the privacy we needed when working in the area. Susan provided a nutritious light breakfast each morning and anything else we requested. Her home is very near transport to the city and the restaurant area of Leichhardt. We had no trouble parking in the street right outside her house. I would definitely recommend this garden studio.
2018-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,19508741,Shane,Very clean and quiet apartment. Directly across the road from the bus and close to everything else. Both Tessa and rod are very lovely people and make you feel very welcome.
2019-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,21612973,Dominik,Martin & Jackie are true superhosts. We stayed her in early March 2019 and had a fantastic time. Super apartment and Martin personally ensured our stay in Manly as comfortable and smooth as possible. AirBnB at its best. Thank you!

2016-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,13299549,Dana,"The location of this apartment is excellent. It's a five minute walk to the ferry and rail terminals and waterfront, and a 15 minute walk to the opera house. It's a suitable size for a family of four, with two beds in the second bedroom. We loved having a washer and dryer. If you plan on using the kitchen, plan on supplying a sponge to wash the counters, salt and pepper, dish soap, paper towels.... There are no extras. This was ok, we just were surprised and ended up buying what we needed. Also, there is road construction going on and it's loud. It goes all night, and some nights were worse than others. Despite the noise, the apartment worked well for our family, and the location is really good."
2019-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Amanda,"The apartment was very centrally located, an easy walk to many tourist destinations. The wifi was a bit spotty. It was convenient to have a washer and dryer in unit. Would definitely stay here again!"

2016-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,6046461,Tim,"Really wonderful stay!

I needed to be at Darling Harbour for work this week, and Suzie's place is right there. Perfect central CBD location.

The room and the apartment are even nicer than described and shown n the photos. It's not a big place (expected in this location) but it's exquisitely appointed and meticulously clean. You get a room with a very comfy bed, and space to unpack your things. You also get your own bathroom with tub and shower. There's a sitting room, balcony: just really nice. 

And Suzie is lovely. I was very busy and we didn't cross paths much, but she was friendly and accommodating on the details of my arrival, and made it easy to live in her home for a few days. She added several nice touches, like fresh fruit in my room that was replenished.

The only thing that might be a worry for some folks: this is a downtown location and there's a busy freeway nearby, which could be a problem if you're the sort of sleeper who needs absolute silence. But it's not a worry after all, as Suzie has a supply of earplugs in the bedside table!

If you want a chic central apartment to be close to the action, Suzie's got your place."

Joseph was very helpful with storage of luggage, as we arrived very early before check in time, and wanted to explore the town. The area felt safe and the train and bus were nearby and easy to use for guests without cars. (The bus stop was right outside the building, and the bus and train were exceptionally clean and also felt safe). I recommend researching the process for where to buy passes for the bus and train."
2017-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,17944310,Lisa,Ali's place is easy to get to if travelling to Sydney and then great to access many parts of Sydney without huge traffic delays.  We enjoyed our stay in the excellent and very clean Granny Flat which catered to our needs nicely. Quiet suburb yet close to major shopping centre and motorways to get you where you want fast. Great value and would hesitate to book again. Lisa

The one downfall is there is a lot of street noise all throughout the night and especially in the early morning when people start to head to work. So if you're a light sleeper, you might want to book elsewhere. "

2015-08-03T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Clarence,"Naveen and her husband have been one of the most patient hosts we had in our trip and was also the last place we stayed in Sydney before leaving. We want to thank her graciousness and consideration towards us as we fumbled through our last few days, trying to say bye to the amazing city. Naveen and her husband were also nice enough to provide interesting guides to cafes, maps and provided a thorough walk through of the neighbourhood which incidentally is - we believe to be - one of the cooler neighborhoods if you enjoy pubbing and cafe hopping.

Her home was exactly as described in the listing if not better and wowed us the moment we entered the house. We had our own private toilet just outside our room and was delighted with how immaculately clean the it was. Our room was cozy and the mood lighting light (that amazingly has 6 colors to choose from) made the room funky yet extremely homely. The space in the room was spacious enough for two people and 3 luggages. The bed was also extremely comfortable and to top it off was provided with comfy bath slippers and robes. Her living room is definitely one to check out and her husband Tristan gladly talked to us about how the design came about.

It was a pity we did not get to try out the gym, the pool and the sauna which was literally the adjacent room from the house.

Lastly, Naveen's dog has got to be the friendliest and cutest dog we have met in our travels, being extremy warm and cuddly and perhaps only barked once throughout the entire stay to greet us when we came back. It really gave us no trouble at all despite Naveen's joke on being a threat to our shoes.

Overall, the stay was good and we would recommend the place to anyone who wants to be close to the city but yet need an affordable place to stay. 

Thanks Naveen!!

2013-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Lydie,"I really enjoyed my stay by David, the appt was really clean and he's a perfect host, well organized and very helpful. You will have all the privacy that you might need.
All you need will be already in the room: recommendations, map, wifi code, plug, umbrella, extra blanket, everything!
The bed is very comfortable, and the terrace is such a luxury to enjoy some calm after walking all the day in that big city.
The location of the appt is efficient, as its really easy to get in all the different area of Sydney (the Domain, Botanical garden, Opera House, circular quay to get the ferry, Potts point and Oxford street is just down there).
David was kindly let me do a laundry, which is great when you are traveling for a while. I will definitely stay by him again for my next trip to Sydney."
2016-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Kevin,"It was an honor to have had Linda as my very first AirBnB host. She was very accommodating and easy to talk with. She made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. She also provided directions to the best restaurants and tourist attractions.  As for her place, it's well-organized and has an ample amount of space. The space is very comfortable that we were easily able to settle in. It also has all the essential appliances that a home needs. Its location is very convenient as it is relatively near to the city, close to grocery stores and restaurants, and within reach of a train/bus station for those who want to go around. I would highly recommend staying at Linda's place to anyone planning to visit Sydney! We sure had a great and hassle-free time during our stay!"

Susan was an amazing host, she helped us whenever she could. We really liked the location of her home because it wasn't in the busy city center but you could easily reach it by bus. "
2017-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,16635022,Brett,"I do not normally care to write reviews but I had to after staying at this apartment in Redfern. The entire apartment is lovely and it is directly near the train station. The value of the property is great. Unfortunately, just about every Airbnb rental does not allow you to have parties or any big events, including this apartment. However, this apartment complex has a pool and a place to grill out (where you can bring people) which really sets it apart from other Airbnb rentals. What really surprised me was the excellent hospitality. Jess is extremely trusting and nice because she would always help me out with any possible inconvenience that I encountered. For example, once I requested to stay one night less because of my financial budget since I am a broke college student. Jess said that's fine and asks if she can pay me electronically (for the night that I would not be staying), but I had to ask her if she could pay me in cash because I had zero in my bank account (It takes a few days to transfer) and I needed the money for food for that week (However, I didn't tell her that). I felt bad asking for the cash to be delivered because I knew she had to take care her 3 - week old baby but it was like essential. Without hesitation, she dropped off the money the next day in cash and she didn't know how much that helped me out. Also, they provide you with a pamphlet that lists places to eat nearby, they give you privacy, jess constantly responds to your text messages immediately, and they have the place refurbished with every possible necessity. You would think that they wouldn't care about you and your stay after you give them a down payment, but unlike most Airbnb's, they want you to have a great stay even after you pay. It's like staying at a hotel. I highly recommend this place in particular because I researched all of the possible Airbnb rentals for hours and this was by far the best-valued one that I could find."
2015-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Jeffrey,Great place to stay

2014-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,1145567,Ziad,"Alison and Adam were my saviours in Sydney. our logistics officer booked us an hotel in the middle of nowhere in Ryde, claiming that it was the nearest point to Sydney Olympic Park as i had to attend the WPC14 with my colleagues. When i check the location, had to cancel and rushed to my ultimate accommodation portal, broadcasting generic message to nearby hosts to secure an accommodation the soonest.

Alison was among the first to reply, and to pre-confirm...
By the time i got there, Adam was already waiting for me and even kind enough to give me all the directions at 8am and off course waited for me outside to make sure that i'm paying the right cab fee. 

What can i say Adam, made feel at home from very first moment, kind, genuine and warm welcoming host. The house is is really nice fully refurbished, in a quite and well connected neighbourhood. My room was upstairs, a nice sunny room with  a queen bed and a bathroom attached. After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. 

Felt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that's all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don't miss Rozelle Market (Sat & Sun). 

Now the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he's a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam's expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Airbnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)

All in all, i great time, the house is warm, clean, and comfortable and the hosts are simply AWESOME

2017-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,16087198,Craig,"Sydney has come a long way since I was 19 and thinking how anglo it was compared to Melbourne.Now I am 52 and delighted to discover an enclave of Chinese food and culture on the upper North Shore. Min very kindly picked me up from the train and sent me the map on his phone when I managed to get lost a few times in the early days. Great big house, an Edwardian gem sympathetically renovated with a lovely pool. Very kind elderly relatives popping in and out and letting me know in Mandarin that it was about to rain (I had washing on the line.) This area is so great for Asian food. Cheap clothing place run by a Korean lady nearby. A delightful area surrounded by native bushland. A holiday at home and a great insight into the contributions made by enterprising recent arrivals. A chilled out house, no hassles. Such kindness that transcends the language barrier. A great month in the Harbour City at an unbeatable price. "

The place is huge, clean, and absolutely stunning. You will be greeted by a small garden leading up to the gate, and your room is nothing short of a hotel room with a comfy, white bed with warm covers. The place is clean and quiet, and also accessible as there is a 7/11 nearby. Would have loved staying here longer than just one night, but it was a pleasant experience nonetheless."

2015-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Philippe Et Claudie,"Gavin was really nice , easy to communicate with and flexible.The location of his place is ideal to visit Sydney. The bedroom is big and we could put our clothes away in the cupboard. We could easly cook in the kitchen."
2018-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Terry,A great convenient location to stay for visitors to Sydney with a great host.
2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,2820832,Julie,"A spacious house in a great location, a lovely host who makes sure you are at feel at home.  For those with a family the added playroom is fantastic.  I would highly recommend for those wanting to stay in the Sutherland Shire, 2 minutes drive to Cronulla and surrounding suburbs.  "
2017-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Anthony,"Angela made our stay in Sydney very easy, she informed us well about the neighborhood, public transports, restaurants & everything we needed at her place. She couldn't be there upon our arrival but we communicate seamlessly through Airbnb. She also arrange us because we needed to stay for one more night and it didn't cause any problems to her.

Her place was very cosy & nice, so was our room, very bright with all the commodities you'd expect. The bed was very confortable and helps us beat the jetlag easily as we were coming from a 8+12 hours flight from France!

The location itself is great, I mean, you can walk to the beach in 5/10 minutes from foot! There is also loads of restaurants/cafes near the beach and you're like 15 minutes away to Rockdale station by bus if you want to go to the city center! The neighborhood is safe and quiet, perfect for families too! Angela lives with her son Coby, and they never bothered us so that won't be an issue at all if you were wondering! Either you want to live your life or socialize is up to you as they are really easy & respectful people! 

Me and my girlfriend enjoyed our stay very much and we would definitely come back again!"
2018-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,20767798,Chris,"Jared's apartment is located in a great spot in close proximity to circular quay. The apartment is of reasonable size and easily fitted the two couples staying. Access to the building requires a security fob for the front door and key to the apartment. Unfortunately only 1 set of keys is provided which makes it incredible challenging if there are more than 2 people staying. I contacted Jarad early in the stay however he wasn't willing to provide the key. It is also worth noting that the bedrooms back onto a laneway with rubbish trucks coming past in the early hours of the morning (we stayed on a friday/sat night). I would suggest bringing ear plugs and eye shades as the outside street light does shine into the rooms. The apartment was reasonably clean and apart from the access issues, was great value. 
"
2015-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,5461928,Gail,"Stephanie is a delightful,thoughtful and generous host. She was prompt in responding to questions and left her home in a welcoming manner. The cottage is delightful,comfortable and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Glebe is just wonderful with lots of atmosphere and close to many of Sydney's highlights.
This was our first foray into Airbnb and we are hooked! It was an excellent initiation and no doubt a hard act to follow!
I thoroughly recommend Stephanie and her cottage and Glebe. I hope that I can stay there again."
2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,16166535,Robyn,"The description of the house as a mansion does not disappoint. This is a beautiful, stylish home with friendly, hospitable hosts."
2018-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,23493822,Abby,"最大的败笔就是图片和实物完全不是一间房间  也小不少   这个感觉很不好｡不喜欢这种行为｡

如果用实拍图其实房间不错的 干净整洁 像motel  适合临时住一晚｡有独立卫生间 基本用品   坐落于整体个house侧边单独修的一间房间 所以私密性比较强  如果你把它当成是motel其实还不错的  然后页面提到空调 衣架没看到有｡ 隔音不好｡全部如实描述｡"
2014-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Phoenix,It's a nice stay with Hernan and thanks for the tidy room. Convenient to city and you can get everything nearby

2018-11-05T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Marja,"Great apartment to stay in if you are in Sydney! Perfect location, comfy couch, nice shower, very comfortable bed and stunning views. Hugo and Pamela are great hosts. They inform you well and respond quickly on messages. Check in is easy."
2015-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Kassandra,Thank you for such a great stay. House was clean and a lot bigger then the photos make it look. Plenty of room for our large group. The spa upstairs was nice after our pamper night.

Good location 
Short stroll to ferry"
2019-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,1944996,Maggie,"Great space with interesting decor. The bed was in an interesting and cozy place and the bathroom extremely clean and spacious. 

P.S. If you can't find the remote for the speakers it might be under the couch pillows, not the host's fault. We found it randomly at the end of our stay so future dwellers be warned! haha"
2014-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,781631,Gordon,"Mike is a very easy going, friendly host and gave me plenty of privacy. The apartment is good value and very well located: just a thirty minute walk to the CBD / Opera House or a $15 cab fare. This is an old but clean building and clean apartment. It is fairly noisy from the street traffic in the morning and early evening but I found I got used to it quickly. There a lots of places to eat and a supermarket is very convenient. I cooked for myself in Mike's kitchen with no dramas. Overall, this is excellent value. I would stay again, definitely."
2018-05-21T04:00:00.000Z,13437841,Matt,"The apartment was great overall. Fantastic location in Darlinghurst, right off of Williams St, a 10 minute walk to Town Hall station. 5 minutes to Hyde Park and 10 minutes to King's Cross. The studio is very well designed, with a nice large living area and floor to ceiling windows. The furniture could use an upgrade, as the chairs are a bit shabby, but they do the job."
2018-05-14T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Jeongha,"It was perfect. There is nothing to tell about this house bad. I and my boyfriend had time at the house for 3 nights and 4 days. While staying here, we felt we were in a luxury hotel since it was very very clean and very well-organized. Before going to this house, my bf and me were unsure if this house would be real since the house or room was perfect but it was pretty cheap for its perfection. 
I highly recommend this house to everyone who wishes to stay around the airport (takes only 24mn by walk, 20mn by bus from the airport). I love this houseeeee!!!!!"
2017-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Nolan,"Desirees place was awesome. The room was very clean, internet speed was sufficient, and all the goodies that she provides in the room ( extra toiletries, snacks, and even wine in the kitchen and refrigerator were a great bonus.  The location of the condo was very convenient to get around Sydney.  Lots of restaurants and train stations nearby !!!  Desiree was also very quick at responding to our needs and questions . Overall, 5 out of 5 stars for us !!!"
2015-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Nguyen,"We had a great time staying at Bernadette's apartment, they were friendly and very generous. The view from apartment is just amazing, we definitely will stay again :)"

2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,24460520,Paulo,"You can tell Julia is a superhost because of her attention to details. From small welcome cards to simple but carefully selected breakfast products.
The location is great, just a quick walk away from Kings Cross station. Great appliances make the stay very comfortable and I thoroughly enjoyed the selection of teas and coffees offered.
The apartment itself is very ""hygge"", a term we learned reading one of the books available. It's very cozy and the decoration along with the lightning is beautiful.
Not only we stay here again but easily see ourselves living there.
Thanks Julia!

2018-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,24660064,Alex,Great place for a business trip with everything needed
2018-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,26334724,Gianfelice,"The place was overall very nice. The apartment was decently located and very comfortable for a family of 4. Although we had a few misunderstandings with the property managers, it was a very pleasant experience and we would definitely recommend it!"
2015-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Jenni,"We loved staying at Michy's place in Clareville. It's a lovely self-contained cabin which is very well appointed. Originally booked this place as close by to a party we were attending, however given I was sick ended up staying in ordering take-away and enjoying the space instead. Loved having a cup of tea in the sunshine on the verandah in the morning. Would definitely recommend Michy's place to anyone wanting to explore the northern beaches of Sydney. Tucked away in one of the most beautiful suburbs of Sydney (one I had never visited, despite being a Sydney-sider) with lots to explore nearby. "
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Eunju,"Jared's accomodation was great. The location was quite near to the wharf and it was clean. Especially, Ana and Francisco were so kind. Thanks for everything."
2017-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,5923031,Sandra,The flat is very clean and super close to transport and amazing food. We love Newtown and will definitely stay again. Thanks Narelle for sharing your beautiful apartment.

thank you"
2017-10-17T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Neel,This is an amazing place for a family to stay. The hosts were quick with their responses and accommodating to our needs. The area is very cool and is well located to properly experience the Sydney area!
2018-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,20206764,Daniella,"Sacha’s place was amazing, it is in great location only 8 minutes away from the beach. He was a great host and gave us tips to get around the neighborhood. The house is beautiful and very comfortable, it is by far the best airbnb I’ve stayed in, my family and I didn’t want to leave!"
2017-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Amy,"Could not recommend this place more highly! Travelling solo with my 3 month old daughter this place was a little piece of home! Immaculately cleaned and well thought out. Small touches like a bath robe, clothes washing and drying facilities, Apple TV and Netflix - all added to the experience! Close to supermarket and shopping centre and bus to Manly. Hosts were friendly and helpful - even letting me store my bags after check out! 

Sincerely enjoyed my stay. Only downfall is that I wasn't able to stay longer!!

Thanks again Leslie!"

2015-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Derek,Fantastic stay. Just like the pictures it was a beautiful apartment and location. Thanks Bernadette for the yummy home made biscuits on arrival with orange juice. Fred was a terrific host and I enjoyed my chat with him. A very wise man! Thank you both so much and can't wait to return. Loved the Beach cafe near by also.
2017-04-17T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Helen,"Five stars. Lovely little flat very close to Newtown station (less than five minutes). Narelle has thought of everything - washing powder, plenty of sockets, small carton of milk - a great host. Small flat but perfectly formed. Very, very clean. Amazing comfortable bed, and nice and dark for a good lie in. Lovely little balcony. Triple glazing to keep out the traffic noise. I was travelling alone and felt very safe. Only issue could be the stairs - no lift - but I'm lazy and I could manage them easily! Highly recommend. I will try to stay here again next time I'm in Newtown."
2018-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Sean,"Location was perfect for me. Clean room, nice view. A little noise (Saturday night, expected) but didn’t lose any sleep. Would stay again! "

2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,24460964,Jason,Place was sparkling. Very convenient location. Kitchen and washer and dryer worked well. Check in and check out worked well.
2018-08-28T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,John,"We've had a great stay in McMahons Point and the amazing space which was very well considered and curated. Everything was as described and there is plenty of space for a large group. The quirky decoration makes for many talking points. Communication was easy, clear and quick. Great location too with easy access to anywhere as it's close to the brigde with plenty of local shops also. A memorable space!"
2018-05-25T04:00:00.000Z,15920870,Jo,"A great modern spacious apartment in a secure apartment complex. Perfect for what I needed. Has a laundry & full kitchen & basic kitchen essentials which was great for the meals I cooked. Also excellent public transport options only a few minutes walk away. Fantastic to have a secure car park if you do have a vehicle. The bed was also super comfy.

Oliver was great to deal with always replying straight away.

My only negative would be that it can be a little noisy. You can hear the lift which is just outside, the family with kids next door & the horses training in the morning. I am however a very light sleeper so may not be an issue for others & despite this I had a great stay & would recommend highly."
2018-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,24916551,Angel,"Alice is a great host! She’s easy and accommodating to all of my request. I love the location and it’s close to the nice eateries, very convenient!"
2018-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Szilvia,"I spent a very good time in Louise's apartment. Everything was as described. The arrival was very easy with the key in the key lock and Louise and her husband gave me all the information needed. They were very responsive and available by email. Internet connection worked perfectly in the apartment. The amazing city center is accessible by several buses (bus stop is about one minute by walk). The surrounding is quiet, I really appreciated the parrots coming on the balcony in the morning. Thanks Louise and John."
2017-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,13302796,Roslyn,Good place.  Centrally located and a wonderful host

2018-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Heidi,Sarah was so friendly and really accommodating. The kids loved the pool and even though it was short we had the best time. Easy parking and a lovely street!

2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,16193945,Mandy,Very nice outlook however a little on the old side.

We had a good time at Clearance House!"

2017-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Ishara,"Desireé’s apartment is the perfect place to explore Sydney city from. Perfectly central to all city sights. The apartment was super clean and neat. It hosts beautiful city views, a quick 5 minute walk to Museum rail station, and a hop to great restaurants and nightlife. The apartment is tastefully decorated with art and books from adventurous travels; furnished and accessorized with absolutely everything that I could require, plus more. I was impressed at the Desireé's thoughtfulness in accommodating her guests needs. Such things as a kind welcome note. Petite chocolates, mini fresh milk packs in the fridge, expresso machine and every conceivable toiletry item one could need inside a bathroom cabinet. Discreetly rolled up extension cords so you never have to look for one to reach the wall socket to charge your digital devices. The bed was comfortable, where sprigs of fragrant lavender greeted us laid upon freshly rolled up towels. We loved our stay and highly recommend Desireé as a host. She communicated well, was always polite and prompt with messaging all required information upon booking. There's no doubt why Desireé has been voted as a super host. You will be delighted."
2017-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,16964637,Greg,"The room with en suite is in a bit of a share house, so it's not like a lot of AirBnB places. A bit more anonymous and private. Judy, however, does respond super quickly to any requests, and I had no trouble getting what I needed. The street is very close to Epping Road, so there is a bit of noise that comes over from this busy street, but that also makes the location very convenient (so there's two sides to every trait). I would certainly stay again."
2017-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Karen,"Sarah is an excellent host and goes out of her way to ensure that you are comfortable and have everything that you need.
We will definitely stay again, thanks Sarah."

2016-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Josh & JY,"Paul and his lovely family were very hospitable and more than accommodating. Everything from the room to the kitchen to the rest of the house had personality, charm and above all, a wonderful homey atmosphere. The best part about our stay was Judith's (Paul's wife) excellent selection of coffee and of course, their two very friendly dogs."
2017-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Rebecca,"We had a great stay in Paul's place. It's in a very convenient location for exploring the city and surroundings. The road directly outside the building is quite busy. If you are a light sleeper this might not be the best option for you, but we were mostly undisturbed. 
Paul was easy to communicate with and was flexible about check in, which I appreciated. I would recommend Paul's place to others who want a convenient base for exploring Sydney. "
2018-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,19846740,Sarah,"Great location and lovely 2 bedroom apartment.

Limited storage for guests, and kitchen essentials was limited.

Would stay again!!"
2014-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Christopher,"Fred and Bernadette were excellent hosts, and made our week in Sydney much more enjoyable vs staying in a Hotel.  They were there if we needed anything, but also gave us our space.  The home is as advertised in their description.  Bus service just a few steps from your front door.  Strong WiFi signal.  

You will find that the bed isn't as comfortable as the one you may have at home, but we slept very well with the ocean breeze cooling the apartment.  

Laundry Room is around back of the Main House so be prepared to walk back and forth to manage your laundry.

Beach Cafe nearby is open everyday for Breakfast and Lunch but is only open for dinner on Friday and Saturday from 500-830.  Excellent food.

Groceries can best be found in Maroubra at Woolies or Coles.  There are also freshmarkets and meat shops there as well.  Great place to stock up if you are cooking for yourselves.

Bus Service.  The 399 is the main bus you will use for most trips you make.  End of the line is Circular Quay in the CBD with no transfers.  Recommend getting an Opal Card to make travel quicker and easier.   **TIP** You will need an Opal Card for each traveller, you cannot share them for multiple riders.

Airport Travel.  Take the 400 to Maroubra near PIcadilly Place and transfer to the 399 Little Bay.  $3.50 per person vs $40 taxi ride.

Beach Walks.  We took the walk from the apartment to Coogee, about 4 miles.  Beautiful walk, but the 1st 1/3 of the walk you are cutting across neighborhoods and parks as the boardwalk isn't complete to Malabar yet.  Bondi to Coogee was very easy to navigate.  You should do both!

Overall - We would highly recommend this location for Couples or a small familyon Holiday.  You will feel very ""local"" staying here, but the CBD and action of Sydney is only a 45 minute bus ride away with no transfers.

Thanks Fred and Bernadette for starting our Australian tour off with a bang!"

2018-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,19376053,Elliot,Great location near central station and great bars and restaurants. Apartment was very stylish and communication with host was excellent. Also price worked out very good value for four people.

Right amongst all the best it has to offer, Paul was very accomodating with an early check in and catered for our little family just perfectly, would definitely stay here again when in Sydney. The convenience was second to none."

It was clean, well equipped and we were able to get an early check-in.
Communication was prompt.
Customers do need to be warned, however, that there is a MAJOR construction site next door, and the noise does severely impact the experience."
2013-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Catherine,"Second time staying with Kerri. What can I say? Best place to stay in the Sydney area. Not only is this a comfortable, clean home, Kerri is the best host EVER! Absolutely loved my stay here! "
2018-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,22020910,Millie,"This apartment was great for our quick Bondi stay. Location is great; right on main street, but beach side so the noise is not much. Beautiful view of Bondi from window and walking distance from all shops/entertainment and scenic walks. Check-in/ out easy with help from Anita, who also provided us with lots of helpful tips about the neighborhood. Bus to Sydney right outside apartment making for easy access to the other sites. No air-con, but fan and window helped immensely. Great place for a beach vacation in Bondi! Definitely would recommend to anyone."
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Jacob,"Unfortunately, the house was not cleaned properly and meant that we had to wear shoes inside to stop dirt and grime from collecting on our socks/feet. Also, the house is very dark, the lounge and dining area (which are the only communal areas) felt like a cave most of the time. But is a great location in Maroubra and was quite affordable by Sydney standards."
2016-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Elizabeth And Brian,"Nicole was very friendly and helpful upon arrival.  The neighborhood was cute but we had trouble eating out in the area.  Only because everywhere was so crowded.  I would recommend reservations.  Even on week nights, the places we tried to go were overcrowded - this may have been just the restaurants we tried to go to though."

2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Michelle,Sensational location with amenities at your doorstep. Jeremy’s property is a great place to stay for a family get together. We will be back.
2012-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Chiara,"Absolutely perfect! 
Tidy, clean, tasty furnished. Location is great too: opposite Centennial Park, 15 minutes bus ride to the spectacular beaches of Clovelly and Coogee and 10 minutes to the CBD. 
Louise was a great host, very kind and helpful...I definitely loved her place."
2018-08-04T04:00:00.000Z,21851474,Remy,"Standard studio apartment, clean, good value."
2018-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Ben,Thanks for having me Alexey. Great location and a lovely bottle of wine on arrival- much appreciated.
2018-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Leila,"Located 5 mins from Museum station and very close to the city centre. Ideal if you want to explore the city or neighbouring suburbs

Would highly recommend this well presented terrace house, although probably not suited for the elderly as the internal stairs to the first and second floors a quite steep and my mother struggled a little.

Overall it is a great house in a great location close transport and bars and restaurants as well as for groceries.

Would highly recommend for a stay in Sydney.

2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,18047246,Nils,A very nice place and room. Ven is a nice person and I had a great night :)
2018-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,29466814,Leanne,"This place was adorable, with lovely details and personal touches - just perfect for my needs. The area had a great vibe, and the location so close to cafes and transport, made getting around and eating out so easy. I will definitely stay again, perhaps a week next time, as it was also very affordable."
2017-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Zara,"The area is more suitable for a group of friends and light travelers as you will have to climb two flight of stairs to the second floor.  The area is quite unique where you have a nice weekend market just opposite at the Fitzroy garden, supermarkets within walkable distance and a fantastic Japanese restaurant just downstairs the accommodation. The noise wasn't that bad but the bed is not for someone who is looking for good quality sleep. Wendy responses quick to my enquiries :) "
2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Eun Hye,"It was a nice place to stay. Quiet, nice, clean, comfortable, and spacious! I liked the easy check in and out system as well. Thank you Sam and Lee!"
2016-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,8559496,Yin,"Tiger is a great host. The place is accurately described. It is by the train station and 2 stops away from Central station. It is tidy, clean and modern. I cannot recommend enough. "
2018-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,15960997,培玉,"房子和图片里描述的一样,交通便利(靠近King Cross火车站,前后都有还有直达市区公交站)非常好找~
卧室､客厅､厨房都有无敌海景,房间也很舒服~
Terry人很热情,我爸妈完全不懂英文,她还是用心帮助,用翻译软件跟我爸妈细心沟通;分享她的投影电视,还特意找来中文电影给我爸妈佐餐,真是无敌好!我们因为行程定的太晚没和父母住一起,每天来接他们Terry也都热情接待,没觉得我们打扰,真的很感谢!"
2017-07-02T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Charmaine,"MissD's place is convenient with streets of food, pharmacies and a supermarket. She is a detailed and gracious host who provides more than just basic necessities. Highly recommended :)  "
2017-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,13689460,Almudena,"Aunque apenas coincidimos con Jack, estuvo disponible en todo momento para cualquier cosa que necesitásemos. La casa está muy limpia, la habitación suficiente para dos, el baño es compartido, puedes usar la cocina. Muy bien situado, aunque no hay estaciones de tren muy cerca (a unos 10 minutos caminando), pero se puede ir al centro a pie.
Recomendaría este alojamiento!"
2017-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,12117514,Matt,Great location right in the middle of Bondi. Gwen was so helpful and made the whole process really easy. 100% would recommend.

2017-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,20906161,Shalina,"The place was great and Alexey was an amazing host. It’s a central location and easily accessible to the train. This place is perfect for those who have never used a train before because all trains end up at this location. The train system starts in a loop first and then branches out into the rest of the city and his place is within this loop. The place is much larger than what the pictures depict. 2 floors with 2 full bathrooms and 2 balconies. There is a very nice restaurant below. Prior to staying in the apartment we thought the noise from the trains would be a problem at night but I️ dont actually remember hearing them.  So I️ basically slept like a baby and I’m a very very light sleeper. It could be that the trains stopped running at night but I’m not actually sure. All in all, this is a great place to stay. We highly recommend it."
2015-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Mabel,"Marcella was very quick with her replies and very easy to get to the accommodation. Location was very good and near the beach. Her place was very spacious and more than enough room for our group. Accommodation was generally quite clean but perhaps the upstairs wasn't used as often so it was a bit dusty. We had a small welcome pack which was a very nice touch! The extensive library was very impressive, wished we have more time to make more use of it. "
2018-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Hazel,"This was exactly as described, and Cathy's extra touches made it a really comfortable stay.

The place was spotlessly clean, the bed linen was really nice quality, there was even shampoo and conditioner (which I appreciated, having forgotten to pack mine).  I also really appreciated the extra touch of providing breakfast -- lovely muesli, greek yoghurt, fresh berries and milk, and Cathy got in touch ahead of time to see what kind of milk I preferred. Extremely thoughtful.

Having stayed in a few places around this area, it was terrific to have off-street parking.

All in all, it was perfect for my needs as a sole traveller in the area for business; I would happily stay here again anytime."
2016-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,James,Very nice stay.  Shuang's room allows you to go in and out on your own schedule and is perfect for short or overnight stays.  Highly recommended!
2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Matthew,"Spend a great 2 nights at Vickie's studio. Well decorated, had everything we need and surprisingly spacious. It was my first time in Sydney, so the location was just perfect; many good cafes and restaurants near by.

Vickie is an amazing host, she made sure we were comfortable and well adjusted. Great person to communicate with.

2017-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,John,Jeremy was an excellent host and the house is perfect for a base near the cbd. The bars and restaurants locally are great. The house makes living in the area easy when working out of Sydney.
2018-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,26829659,Silvio Esteban,"Es un departamento bonito y muy espacioso. Nos encontramos con algunos detalles desprolijos en los dormitorios, con sábanas arrugadas, algunos pelos en las almohadas, y polvo en los muebles. ´Puede que se haya descuidado esto por nuestra solicitud de ingreso unas horas antes del horario acordado, pedido que nos fue amablemente concedido."

2018-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,5862093,Thomas,"Great place. We stayed here a whole month after transitioning  back to Sydney from overseas. I would highly recommend the area especially for nature lovers; cliffs, parks and amazing beaches all at your door step. Kariem had a genuine concern for our well being and comfort during our stay and was very professional and upfront about what the apartment did and didn't offer. I have stayed in many airbnbs in Sydney as I travel alot and so far this has been the most comfortable and relaxing. Recommended."
2015-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,1229797,Elizabeth,Lovely & very neat apartment with a really comfortable bed & that's really conveniently located. We loved the close proximity to Redfern Station & small shops nearby. Irene was very friendly & hospitable to us & responded promptly to any questions we had prior to our arrival. Highly recommended host!
2016-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Ashleigh,"Lovely bright apartment in perfect location! I booked David's Potts Point apartment for myself, as well as my mum and sister for two nights. It was a great size for the three of us! 

I loved sitting by the big window and people watching with a cup of tea in the mornings and glass of red in the evening! I really loved the apartment, quite spacious for Sydney - it was a plus that it was so secure too!

There are markets literally metres away on Saturday, which have plenty of food stalls on offer. There are so many restaurants & bars to choose from all well within walking distance!

David had brilliant communication and was very accommodating. He met us at the apartment and showed us on a map where to walk to get to the gallery the next day, which was extremely helpful and very kind of him. It's a nice walk into Circular Quay, Botanic Gardens and The Rocks.

Last but not least, all 3 of us were in awe of the book collection in the apartment. You have great taste David, I will have to make the next stay longer so I can read some! 

Thank you so much! 
"
2017-07-02T04:00:00.000Z,17438054,Kate,"This would have to be one of the best airbnbs we've stayed in. The place was brand new, immaculate and fitted out with everything one would need-awesome attention to detail. We were traveling with our toddler and George and Lucia were thoughtful enough to provide some toys and even a step stool for her in the bathroom. It's that sort of stuff you don't see all the time but makes things much easier! Great hosts. "
2018-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,10108388,Anne,Desiree’s place was absolutely perfect for our time spent in Sydney. Amazing location and everything you could need! Highly recommend staying here while in Sydney!
2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Machya,The place was fine. The person that checked us in was great! Note ahead of time that the owner gives a warning that the ventilation isn’t great and be careful cooking food—-he said you would have to pay for it if the fire alarm went off while cooking. Other than that it’s in a great location for touristy sights in Sydney
2018-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Chris,"I stayed at Cath's place for around 10 days and found it exactly as described. A cute space with a comfy bed, clean bathroom and handy kitchen.

It was these small touches along with a stylish and extremely clean apartment that made our stay well worth it. If we ever come back to Sydney we will definitely be staying here again. Thank you Griffin!!

2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,17944310,Katherine,Ali and Maryam have a hidden gem here in the Hills District. It is quiet but close to restaurants and businesses in the area. It is clean and modern and felt very luxurious for our midweek getaway. It has everything that you need. We had complete privacy as it has its own entrance.

2015-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Emily,"A perfect location! Two beaches are a mere couple of minutes walk away. We also did a great walk in the National Park which started just down the road from Belinda's. The studio is extremely clean and the kitchen is excellently stocked with everything you're likely to want and need. There is a great BBQ as well. The studio is separated from the main house by a lovely garden, and feels private and very tranquil. 
Belinda was a fantastic host - very welcoming and friendly.
I would highly recommend Bundeena Garden studio to all. "

You overlook beautiful Tamarama beach, which is right between Bondi and Bronte (both within walking distance).

Upon arrival, we were greeted by Tristan and the lovely puppy Felix. Tristan was sure to give us advice and recommendations for the local attractions and where was best to set up our banking and mobile networks. This was really helpful to us.

The room itself was perfect, fit with a very comfortable double bed, a huge window looking out onto the neighbourhood, and all the amenities we could possibly need.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to explore Sydney and the surrounding areas, real value for money."

The apartment was close to cafes and restaurants in Darlinghurst, very close to the city centre and easy walking distance to Museum station - one train from airport. 

I would highly recommend Tam’s place for anyone who is visiting Sydney. I would stay here again when I visit Sydney next time!

2014-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Whitney,"It was a pleasure staying in Marcella's home.  The house was well presented; each room even had travel toiletries.  The beds were comfortable and everyone enjoyed a good night sleep despite a small amount of noise from the neighbours.  
Location was perfect, only a 5min walk to the beach and a short cab ride from the airport (~$50 for a maxi cab).  There were some lovely cafes and restaurants in walking distance and looked as though even more were about to open up.  
Marcella was a fantastic host and I would definitely not hesitate to recommend a stay in her home."
2018-08-19T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Cam,"Ziggy’s place was an unreal spot in Manly, so close to the beach and in the main town you couldn’t ask for better! He was an easy host to deal with and was flexible with checking in and out. Will definitely be staying again when I’m next in Manly."
2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,5604994,Ashleigh,"Great location, clean, great hosts. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area. Lots of nice little extra touches too - snacks, washing powder etc. the space was a lot bigger then expected. Thanks!"
2018-07-02T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Michael,Great location in an upscale building.  Walking distance to EVERYTHING!  Communication was flawless.  Check in/ check out a breeze.  Chloe is a great host!
2018-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,10423504,La-Toyah,"We can’t love this house more.
Parking was a little tricky but didn’t damper our experience. Highly recommend this stay being close to beach, buses and cafes :)"
2017-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Qing,"The apartment is located in a nice place.We can walk to the circular quay in 10 mins.The Rocks,Royal Botanic Gardens and Sydney Opera House are not far where we can walk to.The apartment is small but equiped well.There is everything we need.Cen is very helpful.But the mattress is too soft for my parents,since hard mattress is good for old people's back."
2015-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Alexandra,"Natasa is very welcoming, friendly and lots of fun.
I spent a busy few days in her great terrace and enjoyed one of her delish curries with drinks on the leafy terrace.
I’m not surprised she always has so many guests.
Thanks Natasa"
2019-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,17028088,Frances,"Kathy’s home in Randwick is perfect if you want something close to Sydney but gives you the option to enjoy the towns nearby.  The bus into Sydney is almost outside the house, so this provides a link to the rest of the extensive public transport system (a tram service will be available soon too).  Opposite Kathy’s house is the most amazing Centennial Park; lakes, walks, fantastic wildlife (including flying foxes roosting in the trees!) and a tasty coffee and snack mean you can spend a happy hour enjoying the peace and tranquility. 
There is so much to see and do in Sydney you will never be bored. We bought tickets for a performance at the Opera House, took ferry rides and walked miles around the streets. The Rocks and Bangaroo are beautiful and fascinating if you are interested in history, social change and architecture. Bangaroo Reserve is ‘must see’! 
Outside of the CBD are many other towns some with lovely seaside fronts and beaches. The bus to Coogee Beach is about five minutes away and takes you right to the promenade with shops, cafes and glorious golden sands in less than twenty minutes. 
Kathy is always on hand if you need some help and advice but you have your own space and privacy. A great place for exploring Sydney and the surrounding areas."
2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Tessa,"You cannot beat this location in Bondi. Walking distance to the beach, cafes and restaurants. The house was big enough to accommodate two couples and two babies plus have some friends over for dinner without feeling cramped. We ended up having bad weather so we were inside a lot but that didn’t matter because the house was so spacious and had a fireplace! I would highly recommend this house."
2017-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Andrew,"Well decorated studio apartment great for couples or single travelers. The apartment is newer and has a great efficiency kitchen with all appliances you need in addition to a nice bathroom.

The view looks into an inner space in between apartments and you can see into the neighbors kitchen, but nothing new if you have stayed in big city airbnbs.

The apartment did not have A/C at the time of stay, I would recommend this place as long as it's cooler outside or more fans were brought in.

The location is phenomenal. Lots of restaurants and a few coffee shops nearby with easy access to Kings Cross Station for your metro needs.

Great stay overall!"
2015-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,7920463,Katja,Konrad was a friendly host.
2016-11-06T04:00:00.000Z,8130620,Steve,"The views were  amazing , most of the time spent in the apartment were out on the balcony taking in the scenery . We felt like we were in a home from home the apartment was lovely and clean and the area was nice and quiet but just a few mins drive from the city centre . It had everything we needed and Sara responded immediately with any queries we had. It was a lovely place to stay and if I ever return to Sydney will be looking to book with Sara again"
2018-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,20962081,Nancy,Good location and very roomy apartment
2017-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,10091713,Ania,"Wow......this met all of our expectations and more. Clean and tidy with fresh sheets on a comfy bed and Sheridan towels. Not to mention the extras that I wont bother to take next time we stay like umbrellas, shopping bags, tea bags, band aids and spare blankets. Perhaps having  a hairdryer available would have lightened my luggage! 
Check in and check out was easy. Ben was available ,approachable and very helpful. 
The location was perfect for exploring Sydney. A 20 min stroll down historic Oxford St to Darling Harbour. Many different buses right out the front to Centre Point, Bondi, Circular Quay  just to mention a few. Don't forget to get your Opal card from any newsagent and you can top it up with cash on line! Walking distance to the train to explore further a field.
 The studio apartment on the 7th floor has spectacular views ( the photos don't lie!) and is nestled in a friendly community with many restaurants/cafes/shops/chemists all within walking distance. We will be back for many visits I am sure...thanks again Ben!"
2017-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,16651655,Nathan,Good proximity to international airport.
2018-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,24660064,Allison,"This property is reasonable value for $
Loved the location and the sun light streaming into the unit. Lovely and peaceful and a good size apartment.

If you’re ok with a worn lounge and a shower head that does wet you but not much else ... then give this one a go ... afterall it’s got to be one of the cheapest around so we were ok with these little problems.

The hosts provided an efficient friendly service ... so thank you :)

Allison and Daniel"
2017-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Bill,"The unit is well located and while small, had everything we needed to be comfortable. It was clean and the bed was very comfy. No complaints at all. "
2015-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Andrew,"I spent a lovely weekend in this cute little fully self contained apartment. Belinda has though of all the little things that make your stay amazing. It close to the shops and the beach. There are some amazing nature walks and mountain bike trails in the area. 
Really good value and i would recommend this little gem to anyone..."

2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,21637487,Andrew,"Great location and stylish, nicely renovated apartment. Not much wardrobe space for clothes but otherwise well equipped. Kasey was very helpful and responsive. I would recommend this to friends."
2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,16964637,Sneha,Opted Judy’s place for the second time. Arrangements were perfect. Happy with the service and prompt responses whenever needed. Would definitely prefer staying here during my next visit as well.
2018-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Ramona,"Alexey's place is centrally located, just  metres away from Central Station. It's clean, comfortable and Alexey went out of his way for a flexible check in for us. There are also very thoughtful touches around the house - such as chardonnay on arrival. Highly recommend."
2016-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Brian,"Wonderful apartment unit. Very clean and cozy. Louise mum was an absolute superstar. Clean bathroom too. Getting to CBD was easy. We always travel by UberX to Central Station which usually will cost us around $12-15 dollars. Many eateries within 10 minutes walking distance. The ""travel around guide note"" and ""house manual print-out"" which was prepared by Lousie  was very helpful indeed. The downside is the unit is on the 3rd floor with no lift. But in overall, we enjoyed the stay."
2018-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,22268452,Anthony,"Shaun was very communicative,and his apartment was clean and close to public transport,I would recommend this apartment and Shaun as a host."
2017-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Joel,"Great location, and the apartment is nicely appointed. Vickie was an excellent, communicative host. I would stay again."
2017-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,13302796,Joel,Right in the middle of the CBD so this is the place to go for convenience.
2017-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Daewhan And Lisa,Shuang's place was nice and very clean! Only about ten minutes walk to a big grocery store and another five to Wolli Creek train station. $10-15 for uber from and to the airport. Highly recommend staying here!
2018-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Laura,"Location was great, 10 min walk to train station. View of bridge: amazing. Size: think Manhattan or Tokyo. Bed: extremely comfortable. 
Quirky and older building/apartment with a few things that remind you its old, though not any pressing issues. 
Noise at night like any big city, but free parking and an elevator make up for it. However, (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps nor GPS took me to the correct address, so be prepared if you’re driving. Safe, and served the purpose. Recommend to a single or easygoing traveler!"
2016-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,9701620,Jeanne,"Bryan was a terrific host, very communicative, even anticipating our needs.  For instance, we are academics and Bryan, without prompting, sussed out that we might need a desk during our stay and set one up upstairs!  The Treehouse is in the perfect location - Glebe is AMAZING - and totally comfortable."
2017-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,16651655,Lisa,"Exactly what it says on the tin. Great location, private & clean."

2015-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,5581269,Carol,"What an absolutely fabulous place to stay. Michy is considerate warm and a genuine lady. From a warm welcome on arrival, milk in the fridge, everything one could desire in the perfect spot to even driving us to our restaurant for dinner she is amazing. The cabin is perfect, it is beautifully decorated. The bed is large, deep and immensely comfortable. It took a real effort to prize my boyfriend away amid grumbles of why he couldn't squat there.....the cabin is reached by the stepping stone path around the main house, through the small garden and sits on its own. It is breathtakingly pretty....has a comfy sofa, a full bookcase,  a gorgeous mosquito net that makes you feel like you are lost in the orient falling asleep. I cannot tell you how fantastic this little treasure is we will most certainly be returning. "

2017-12-31T05:00:00.000Z,21716100,Marianne Terry & Richard,"Tam's place is the ideal family home for a perfect getaway. The location was great to avoid the crowds but close enough to Curl Curl, Freshie and Manly to enjoy the beaches and all that the area has to offer. The pool was a definate draw card and the outdoor area is conducive to rest and relaxation. It's obvious that Tam is a keen cook as everything is thought of and available for entertaining. Would definately recommend and would come back again!"
2019-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Margie,David’s apartment is lovely great position in the heart of Potts Point so convenient to everything. The communication with David was fabulous the apartment was spotless and all the ammenities you need for a short stay would highly recommend.
2018-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,22295401,Olga,Cosy and clean apartment in a vibrant area. Griffin is very responsive and thoughtful host. We liked complimentary coffee and snacks provided. Recommended!
2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Gary,"Great location. Great price for 3 seperate rooms. 
Starting to show some wear and tear but does the job. 6 adults easily accommodated.
Very responsive.
Unfortunate cleaners let the room down, travelled a lot but found a few things I def shouldn’t have! Others may have been more offended. Great value for 6 adults in the cbd though"
2016-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Liz,"Had a great time in the garden suite at Susan's! It was my own private bungalow which was just lovely. 

Leichhardt is an awesome suburb of Sydney and I found the bus system to be very easy to navigate with a stop at the end of the street (1 min away). 

Tons of cool cafes along Norton street, especially Petit Fours - delicious French bakery!

If you're looking for a more quiet relaxing Sydney vacation, this is the place to be.

"
2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,24863216,Thomas,"I stayed 4 nights at Vivian's, the location was perfectly located 5mins of the best Sydney beaches. The studio was pristine fitted with everything I needed. The day I arrived there was a mini glitch with the door system, 5mins after my call, Patrick came over and fix it. Definitely a place to stay for few days !"
2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,5549057,Anastasia,Brendan is great and his apartment and room is very comfortable. Perfectly located. Brendan is a walking book if you need a tip for a trip around. Was very kind and let us bring out bags earlier than a check in time and also was  activily helpful in general. Thank you Brendan!
2018-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Ted,"Everything was fantastic, great communication and very helpful. Would recommend"
2017-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Tina,We had a lovely stay as well as I experienced a little issue when I got locked out of my room and the key was in there. Miss D was very helpful and this issue could be resolved in no time. A great stay and very comfortable Would highly recommend this place!
2017-08-11T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Gemma,Had a wonderful week staying in Fred and Bernadette's lovely apartment! Such a stunning location right across from the beach! Fred and Bernadette were wonderful hosts and the apartment had everything we needed! Would definitely recommend for a wonderful beach getaway!
2015-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Ying,"我们在这里住了两晚,男主人非常友善｡房东的作息规律,所以晚上整个屋子都很安静｡卧室和卫生间干净,步行至city需要20分钟｡"
2017-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,20374683,Louise,"Great location, was a little bit noisy traffic wise, shops, pubs and public transport all very close. Home was clean, furnishings at a minimum, but comfortable enough. Strange burn’t plastic smell, host explained that heavy cooking/burning had happened previous. However even with doors opened for fresh air and a smelly candle, the smell would not go. In saying that I would stay again, as the location was fantastic and we could sleep 8."
2017-04-27T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Justine,"A great place within a 20 minute walk to the international terminal. There was some construction near the airport, but plenty of signage directing me to the terminal. Check-in/check-out was very easy and the place was immaculate. "
2018-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,17223695,Stuart,"We had a mixture of ‘first time to Sydney ‘ and ‘ been before’ in our family group. The apartment was so convenient for everything - the beach - the shops and the ferry, it couldn’t have been better. If you are on the beach and have forgotten something it literally only takes a minute to return to the apartment.
We had a hire car and the large garage with electronic doors was a major ‘ plus’ as parking In Manly can be a  big challenge especially at the weekend when the beach is busy.
Anita has thought of everything - washing liquid - dishwasher tablets- sewing kit - ironing board - so many things that in other rentals you have to go out to stock up with a months supply that you only use for a week. Anita has it all - it’s a small touch that really raises the quality of the rental.
We are definitely coming back - already booked for trip two! The first timers and the experienced visitors in our family group all have new memories to cherish of our week in Manly.
Anita is very responsive and we are grateful to her for making our week in Manly so comfortable."
2017-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,16070079,Christopher,Fantastic location suitable to all different needs. Walking distance to the majority of central Sydney. Would definitely stay again and recommend to all who are interested.
2016-04-26T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Jen,"My second stay at Fred & Bernadette's place was great! The morning sun & sound of the waves crashing is just divine. Once again the apartment was clean and there was even a birthday card with a present! I wish I could go back more often, highly recommended."

2018-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,6785160,Kuin Mee,"We stayed at this wonderful home for 6 nights. We truly enjoyed staying at this quiet and lovely home of Carole and Steve. They are so helpful and caring.

2017-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Jodie,Fantastic place to stay! Philip generously allowed me to drop my luggage off before official check in time which was greatly appreciated. I was greeted by Matt who was so friendly and welcoming. The house was immaculate in both presentation and cleanliness. The stairs take a little  bit of getting used to but they are very sturdy. Location was convenient for my needs and the neighbour felt safe. Certainly enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend Philip's place. Thank you!
2018-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Lisa,"David is a great host. From the beggining letting us leave our ridiculous amount of luggage early so we did not have to lug it around till check in and also allowed us to check out late for the same reason. The apartment is in a perfect spot. Park across the road for our 5 year old daughter. Close to trains and buses, cafes and restaurants. A clean, comfortable and most enjoyable stay. Thank you. Lisa."
2017-05-21T04:00:00.000Z,18620288,Jp,"Really had a good time in the apartment.
Accurate description, and so happy to offer that to my sister's and husband first trip to Australia, Sydney.
Mavelous view when waking up, we've been lucky with the weather, great situation. Close to the ferry -10 mn, Neutral Bay, very close, couldn't be better. Feeling so lucky finding this apartment and being accepted.
Quiet environment, safe car park, good internet, all facilities... Good bed (according to my sister), I had the sofa and cannot complain either, what else can you expect?
Check-in has been brief, straight forward, well organised.
Stephen has been a great host and I want to thank him again.
I hope to come again, one day, if it's not over booked !!!
100% satisfied...

2013-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Eleanor,"Holy moly what an apartment. Actually better than the photos! The vibe is clean, open, breezy, sophisticated. After a picnic lunch at Bronte, We enjoyed dinner together at the table and an evening swim. We were a party of 6, and all of us slept comfortably and felt like a million dollars the entire time. The kitchen was awesome to cook in and the balcony a peaceful breakfast spot. It could not have been more perfect. "

The kitchen contained all of the equipment you could need and the supermarket is just a minutes walk away. The location was great. The apartment was tidy & quiet. Great value for families wanting to stay close to some beautiful sights and tourist attractions. We would highly recommend Angela's apartment."

His place is close to both the airport and a cute beach strip, great for a run first thing in the morning. Everything was very clean and comfortable, and I appreciated that he gave me a lot of space and privacy. Wonderfully easy going and accommodating of my late-ish check-in; great host! "

2018-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Zac,Athena was very thoughtful with accommodating my needs. I needed to check in early and she was able to let me do so. The actual apartment is spacious and has everything someone would need for a stay in Sydney. It’s also very close to one of the harbors so it’s very easy to hop on a ferry and go to the beach.
2017-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,12655535,Daniel,"The property is just like the description. Location is quite convenient for darling harbor and the rest of Sydney, several places to eat within a 5 minute walk. The space was clean. Staff was very accommodating to meet our requests for an early check in."

2018-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,20698056,Zoe,"I really tried to see the positives with this whole booking so it wasn't a negative review but I couldn't actually rate you zero - it wouldn't let me. So you have 1*

So I'll start with a thank you. Thank you for nothing.

We feel really let down by you as a company. 

 You cancelled our 1st  booking, apparently there was a problem with your airbnb account. (my alarm bells should have been ringing then, but the apartment seemed perfect for us, location and price wise). 
When I contacted you about the issue we re-booked. 
When requested you price matched the 1st booking. 
When I requested check-in details I had no response, 3 days prior to departure or day before departure. 
After a 27+hr flight from UK to Sydney we arrived at the airport and went to check the address details and directions and found the email to say the apartment booking had been cancelled. I get the reason, if its true, I understand. But we landed at 9pm with nowhere to stay. 
Did you personally offer to help us or find us alternative accommodation with you?  A BIG FAT NO! 
Refund when requested. 
Next day we attempted to book another apartment with you and you actually declined us, when really you should have been helping us  to find somewhere to stay.
That is what shocked me the most, the unhelpfulness. You knew why we wanted to stay, you knew the problems we had had before - none of them our fault and still you refused to help. 

No thanks to you, we now have a different apartment/hotel for the duration of our stay - not with your company. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. 

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND YOU."
2016-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Chris,Angela and Coby were very accommodating and friendly. Thanks again.

2018-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,9098095,Lauren,"Margaret was very accomodating to our late check in and late check out the next day. There were thoughtful touches to the carriage that we only discovered before we left. On a longer stay, I’m sure there are more surprises to be found. A very memorable stay!"
2017-03-09T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Ian,"What a great city pad!!
Victoria was so welcoming and had thought of everything you might need including umbrellas ( which we did need!!)
The apartment was spotless & the location was easy enough to get into the centre by foot or bus ... we preferred walking via the amazing Botanical Gardens.. absolutely stunning!!!
Well located & fab restaurants on the door step too & if you like Thai food well Victoria recommended The Opium Den ... we went back twice.... omg it was superb!!
Thanks again Victoria!

We actually live in Sydney but not near the beach, so we had a fabulous time exploring the beaches, rock pool, cafes/restaurants and walks, along with more breeze and less humidity than usual ☺️ Highly recommended."
2018-06-15T04:00:00.000Z,20578419,Vicky,"Location is good... value for money..
But if want to sleep in day time than no chance you can sleep their in day..
Too much noice from construction work around....
Easy location, everything close.. but apartment needs few repairs..
Things like sugar was there to use but not in a jar, just a open packet..
Glass, plates were not washed properly by last guest...
Max was very friendly and able to give quick response...
Still i will give 4 star as it was value for money...."

The location is ideal for getting around the Eastern suburbs. The apartment looks out onto the garden and 'nature's alarm' will ring out every morning. I can't remember the last time I heard a kookaburra laugh!

Der Garten ist ein Traum und entspannt von hektischen Großstadt-Touren. Zu Fuß nur wenige Minuten zum Strand und dem schönen Bronte-Bondi-Walk. Wenn es nachts mal kühl werden sollte, ist eine gute Heizung vorhanden. Werde die Unterkunft wieder gern buchen."
2014-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,501382,Mabel,"The apartment was as immaculate and perfect as the pictures and has everything u need. The location of the apartment was awesome, a short 5-10min drive to the city and Westfield Eastgardens where we went for a late night movie. The only thing to note is that there are no lifts so be prepared to walk up 4 flight of stairs. Other than that, all was good. Louise was amazing, she was very responsive and helpful. Highly recommended :)"
2014-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,2900140,Belinda,"We were very happy with the location of Neiafu and loved being so close to restaurants, shops and the beach.  The apartment was clean and bed comfortable;  Andi had left lots of provisions for our stay, including a Xmas gift under a tree!  Beach towels were a welcome touch too.   Unfortunately, Andi and Ron were away when we arrived leaving us unsure of access areas. "

A comfortable 20m stroll to the Opera House via the gardens.  Apartment very generous in size for 4 and has all you need including foxtel.  Air Conditioner works well and car park is a bonus.

I will certainly stay here again"

I only got to meet Hernan on the last day of my stay in his apartment, as I was busy sigh seeing and he was working. However we communicated well by text message before and during my stay. When we did meet, he was very nice and friendly. His place is very clean and it was a pleasure staying there."

Everything we could have needed was either provided or minutes away.  My only hope is that we can come back again some time soon :) Do note that you will definitely need to follow Margaret's directions. (Hidden by Airbnb) maps has no clue how to find this place!

I walked down to the beach and it was a lot of fun just like all the beaches in Sydney.  A great place and a great deal!"

2017-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Amanda,"The main bed was super comfortable and the place was clean and just what we needed.  Close to all the transit and sites.  The shower wall doesn't come out far and there is no curtain to prevent splashing, so you'll need to wipe down the toilet and floor after showering. Bring your own hand towel and wash cloth if you use one.  Also, it's on a heavily used road and the noise is constant.  Light sleepers won't rest well. "

Fantastic location, across the road from the bay. And a direct and regular bus route into circular quay. Would highly recommend staying with Fred and Bernadette and if we find ourselves back in Sydney in the future, we would definitely try and stay there again."

Man ist zu Fuß in 5 Minuten an der Bushaltestelle und braucht ca. 15 Minuten in die Innenstadt. Die Nachbarschaft ist ruhig und es hat einen Park in der Nähe. Man kann auch sehr schöne Spaziergänge um die Hafenbuchten unternehmen, die besonders schön beim Sonnenuntergang sind. Ashlee und Duncan sind zwei wundervolle Menschen und sind weitaus mehr als nur Gastgeber! Wir hatten 5 unvergessliche Monate mit ihnen und sind überglücklich sie kennen gelernt zu haben! Herzlichen  Dank nochmal für alles was ihr für uns getan habt! Es gibt nur positives über die Beiden und ihrer Unterkunft zusagen.❤"

2017-08-07T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Adrian,"Michelle's place has a great feel and is more like a studio apartment. The private bathroom is a bonus and the privacy provided by a simple divider in the hallway is adequate while allowing for the homeliness of not being totally isolated from the family life of the house. Everything is brand new but one gets the impression that, even if it wasn't it would still be beautifully presented in Michelle's wonderful style. She has thought of everything which makes the stay a memorable experience."

The view to the beach is lovely from the spacious terrace. The kitchen was great, with everything you could need plus.... great for foodies. The bed was extremely comfortable,  especially nice after a long trip from the UK. Also there are ceiling fans everywhere which kept us nice and cool in the heatwave temperatures. We didn’t need to use the air con. Ice machine was a real plus too. We felt instantly at home and much preferred it to the flashier looking apartments on offer on Airbnb. Would be great for families too. Thanks again Lizzy for being so helpful and accommodating."

Netflix's and wifi was a bonus, so was the shampoo/conditioner and soap. So many awesome cafes for breaky and also dinner places. We loved the Indian and the famous Portuguese chicken. The room was very bright in the morning, and the planes were loud but that didn't bother us at all.  Highly recommend this gorgeous cabin. "

2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Sandra,"Awesome location. 5 min walk to circular quay. 

Place is prob only good for immediate family as not much privacy but was perfect for us. 

The only thing I would have liked was a top sheet on the bed as a quilt is too warm but no sheet is too cold. 

Bathroom was a little grubby but I guess with a quick tern around of guests it may be hard to maintain. 

All over VERY good value for money and we will stay again one day"

2017-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Alexandria,Sarah was flexible with the check-in and made things convenient for us. She ensured that we had privacy but also checked in when she could to make sure that all was good. No kitchen (as listed) but the mini fridge and kettle were helpful. Location was convenient with a few minutes walk from the bus stop. Our only surprise during the stay was the dog which was doing it's job loyally but got used to us pretty quickly

2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Gen,"We loved the location of Vickie’s apartment. The area was so quaint with many great cafes in short walking distance and the supermarket just across the street. The bus and train provided us easy access around and the walk to the Opera House and Harbor Bridge through the Royal Botanical Gardens was beautiful, though a bit long. It was relaxing to sit at the bar top and look out at the tree-lined street below or further out to the CBD skyline.  We did find the apartment a bit tight when walking from the main living area to the entry hall where the mini fridge is with the bed lowered, so we probably should’ve raised it when not in use. When I slept I could sometimes feel the the bed frame through the mattress, so I think maybe a memory foam mattress might work a bit better, I’m not sure.  There is a step up/down getting in and out of the shower with somewhat reduced headroom which won’t affect most people but could if someone had limited mobility or was very tall.  The walls were thin but the neighbors were all quiet in the evenings.  Vickie was so sweet to provide coffee, tea, water, muesli, and milk, and she provided us great tips and recommendations on places to go and how to get there! Vickie is truly a superstar host and you’ll be in great hands with her!!!"
2017-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,18841207,Erika,"May is a lovely person, I'll recommand her anytime! oh and, her dog daisy is adorable!"
2018-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,18315277,Chris,"Unfortunately we didn't have a pleasant or restful stay here. Noise from car mechanic shop and building construction site right beside the apartment was so loud that it felt like it was coming from inside the unit! Went on all day long and none of this was mentioned in her listing! The noise was so unbearable that we had to cut our stay short. No one would want to waste their money on a noisy apartment while on vacation, especially after a very long flight!
Even with recorded audio as proof, the host still would not refund for the days we didn't stay. Obviously she doesn't bother checking what goes on around her apartment regularly and that is just negligence! She doesn't seem to care much about guest satisfaction!"
2018-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,27555785,Charmaine,Our group of five enjoyed our stay at Cy's place. The location was really great as it was in the middle of Haymarket and easy to get around by foot. Thanks for having us!
2018-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,4499095,John,"Stayed for ten days, good price, location.  Love to walk so enjoyed walking everywhere.  Through Rushcutters to Double Bay, Verona Cinema on Oxford St, Woollahra and Botanical Gardens/City via Woolloomooloo.  Although Uber arrive within minutes.  Would stay again."
2015-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Ashok,"Staying in this apartment, hosted by Linda, was a wonderful experience for me and my wife. All kitchen amenities provided, hot water and good plumbing, quiet, near Redfern station and the University, plus a coffee shop and pub right across. The host bot a rice cooker for our use too. "
2018-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Liz,Great value. Very very clean and so good if you are coming by plane or need to get to the airport.

2018-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,21127680,ShuMin,"Coffee’s apartment is conveniently located in the CBD, with close access (5-10min walk) to 2 train stations, supermarkets and endless choices of eateries. The apartment is (very) spacious and has everything that we need (washing machine, dryer, pots and pans, utensils, etc). The central heating in the apartment appeared to have broken down and Coffee rushed over to help us with it and brought us new extra blankets. She even called us in the middle of our stay just to make sure we were ok—absolute superhost! We’d give her 50 stars if we could!! Thank you so much for hosting us, Coffee! We’d definitely stay again at your place! 

Just a note for travellers coming in from Sydney airport: we got cheated by the taxi driver and paid $160 for our ride to the apartment when it should be just around $50. Please check the cost with the taxi driver before getting onto the taxi!"
2016-09-08T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Steven,"Great hosts, good place, very chic, very nice, would come back again."
2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Anna,"This is such a great place and ideally located in the ‘nicer’ part of the neighbourhood. 

I found it incredibly peaceful even with the hustle and bustle of the area and noise outside. This is helped by the bedroom view of the trees of the square opposite together with the sound of the water fountain. 

The place is easily accessible to lots of places and all the shops and restaurants nearby are classy and funky. 

I stayed in this area last time and this place is in a better location. 

The flat is cutely designed and a great size for a City break. I didn’t want to leave so soon! 

Great hosts. Friendly and helpful cleaner!"
2014-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Sandra,Staying with Kerri in Sydney was wonderful!  She is a lovely hostess whose home is beautiful and comfortable.  Indeed it was my very best Airbnb experience and I have use these listings many times!

2018-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Nadia,"An ideal location to really experience all of the beauty Manly has to offer. Tricky getting a park but, you don’t need a car as the city is also a quick ferry ride away."
2018-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,朱,"国际机场就十几分钟到二十分钟步行时间,热情的房主人带着我们走到主路指明方^_^回复也是能在第一时间解决到我的问题｡走几分钟可以走到大型超市,晚上11点才关门,附近还有一个小小堂人街,大概有6到7家的中餐馆｡家里整洁干净｡主要离机场近｡"

Cependant wifi n est pas inclu dans le forfait, l hôte m a propose le wifi pour des couts supplementaires."

2016-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,6201263,Taja,I absolutely loved my stay at Yoco house! The apartment is so nice and the best value you can get in all of Sydney! Great location close to everything you need and want! I love how important sustainability recycling and renewable energy is to the house. Highly recommend staying here!
2014-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Sabrina,"Hernan rocks! Extremely laid back, friendly and welcoming. I really appreciated his help with coordinating my early morning (445am) cab to the airport - this including him setting up the appointment and checking in on me at 4:40am to let me know the cab was outside. Super responsive and I had everything I needed. I will definitely stay with Hernan again if I find myself back in Sydney. 

The only thing to note is cabs in Sydney are quite expensive and he's probably a $40-50 cab ride away from the city (or so I heard). That said, the bus stop is a short walk away from the house, and I took it several times to the train station and directly into the city. He also provided public transportation maps to make trip planning that much easier!

Just can't get over how awesome Hernan is!"
2015-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Thilo,We stayed for only one Night. Everything was fine and Hernan was a great host. Would come back to his room.
2018-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Vanessa,Cosy apartment conveniently located close to cafes and public transport. Millie was quick to respond and provided detailed instructions for our stay . Thanks Millie!
2016-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,Debbie,"I second what other guests have mentioned. Great location, cosy room, felt right at home. Loved having Ruski around too. Thanks Kath for having me! "
2014-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Lucy,"We absolutely loved Naveen and Tristan's place, it is very well decorated and was always kept very neat and clean. We felt super comfortable and at ease. The guest's bedroom and bathroom are upstairs so you definitely get your privacy. They prepared everything you need, shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, towels, body wash, etc. And you'll find plenty of pillows and a very comfortable bed, plenty of closet space, and A GORGEOUS VIEW! Naveen and Tristan are both very kind and helpful, and you will LOVE their dog Felix my goodness such a bundle of joy. Location of the b&b is very convenient, you are just 1-2 train stops away from the major scenic spots. You will find the best Gelato shop just down the road. There are plenty of restaurants super closeby. The neighborhood felt safe and welcoming. We loved Sydney because of this b&b :)"
2016-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Tom,Great stay. Very comfortable

2014-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Georgina,"We had a great time in Paddington; the house is fascinating and the room was perfect. Sadly we never met Arnie in person, instead were shown around by his easy-going and lovely friend. Paddington Market is just across the road and we walked everywhere along Oxford St. Highly recommended."
2017-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Sojan,"I really loved millie's apartment , close to all public transport and harbour bridge . Nice view of the sky while in the bed and harbour bridge . Communication with millie was really good. I would recommend this plce and will be back again "
2016-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,13562321,Richard Kok-Fhung,We stayed here for a family of four. Fantastic location! Hot water pressure could have been stronger but otherwise it's fantastic accomodation for a short weekend away.
2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Sian,Anita is a lovely person. The apartment is very homely.
2014-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Fabian,Hernan is a great guy.  The accommodation was also very good.  I would recommend this accommodation
2014-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Hazelle,"“Wow” is probably the best word I can think to describe this incredible place. The photos just don’t do it justice. Finished with impeccable taste, this place is definitely a gem.  Located on the best part of Mackeral beach, and surrounded by wildlife - including a resident wallaby who comes so close you can feed him by hand! The water as crystal clear as Thailand and just a two seconds away, down a very well paved and not too steep path. The views from the house and tree house are beyond breathtaking and the owner is super nice and attentive. Upon arrival he sent a message to see if we got in OK and during the booking phase he responded immediately to our questions. The BBQ is state of the ark (very important!) and the place is totally set up for entertaining with a great coffee machine, two fridges, plenty of cutlery, glasses, plates etc ... . Everything has been thought of, from hats and repellant to hooks to hang out your wet beach towels. We will definitely be back. Everyone who stopped by to visit us while we were there will be booking too, so I just hope we can get in! Thank you Richard. You have created a little slice of heaven. "
2017-06-27T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Kelsey,"From beginning to end, Paul and Judith made us feel welcome. From the lovely continental breakfast to individual bedside lamps, you can tell they have thought of every detail to ensure you have a comfortable stay. Their place is in a great location, only a half hour walk from the city centre, very close to bus stops and 5mins walk away from two great cafes. We also enjoyed spending time with Bonnie and Benny, their two very friendly dogs :) Absolutely recommended and hope to stay here again next time we are in Sydney."
2018-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,22711366,James,A super host!
2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,24460964,Carly,Lovely clean apartment. Fantastic location. Four people stayed for 2 nights and would definitely stay here again
2018-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,22362742,Moyra,"Great apartment, great location, would recommend it to anyone wanting to be in the middle of the city. We loved it, will definitely be back. Eleni was fantastic to deal with also!"
2018-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,21127680,Olivia,Great location
2019-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,26934151,Gabby,George’s place is in an excellent location to the train and some really nice cafes right outside. The area can be a bit dodgey at night time but it definitely means you get to see a more authentic side to Sydney. Beautifully styled and comfortable. Will definitely keep this in mind when I visit Sydney again.
2018-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,16898275,Rohit,"Amazing location ,great place , great response rate ,would go there again"
2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,16070079,Justine,"The apartment is very nice and clean, exactly as shown in the pictures. The communication was easy and the location is good. The internet works properly for those who work remotely. I would recommend a stay here if visiting the city!"
2016-01-23T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Jayne,We had a fantastic time in Newtown it was exactly as described. The house was perfect for what we needed it was clean and quiet the only issue was the air-conditioning system did not seem to be working. However we did have a fan in our room so that was perfect. We would definitely recommend this Airbnb.
2016-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Harry,"Everything is fantastic, more than worth!"
2013-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Kim,"I recently spent a Saturday night in Susan's leafy cabin in Leichhardt - my first Airbnb experience - and was pleased with the ease of booking and low cost. Susan is a friendly, relaxed and hospitable host. The cabin is spotlessly clean, cute, and had a very comfortable bed. Angelo the cat was sometimes chatty but not annoying. The area is convenient and easily accessible by public transport but also suburban which would be interesting for international visitors. The only drawback of the location is the overhead flight path which woke me on Sunday morning, although I went back to sleep once I realised what the noise was! It really felt like I was staying at an old friend's house - one where you could just please yourself - and I'd thoroughly recommend it to others."
2018-10-23T04:00:00.000Z,21127680,Mark,"Fabulous apartment in such a convenient part of the city. It’s a short walk to Central station and the city’s restaurants, bars and parks. Coffee is an excellent host and the apartment was so clean and comfortable. I hope to come back."
2015-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,4499095,Amed,"Dino was such a great host. The check-in/out process was seamless. The apartment itself was amazing. It was well equipped,  clean and very well decorated. The location is great, as the apartment is centrally located in Elizabeth Bay neighborhood. We had a wondeful time in Dino’s apartment  and would definitely recommend Dino's place to anyone considering visiting Sydney."
2018-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,15889399,Naomi,"We have stayed several times at this Airbnb and will continue to in the future.  It is modern, comfortable, quiet, private and is in the perfect location for us.  Steven always answers us promptly and helps with anything we might need.  We have free parking on the street.  We were also delighted to be able to use Netflix."
2019-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,6046461,Iris,Suzie is a great host! Respond quickly and very helpful. She gives me some really good suggestions about transportation and food. I had a great weekend there!
2018-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,20767798,Lianne,Perfect central location to everything sydney !
2017-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,6201263,Pauline,La maison est idéalement située pour découvrir Sydney. Le quartier est agréable et animé. La chambre est spacieuse et bien équipé. Les seuls reproches sont que la cuisine et la salle de bain n'étaient pas très propres et que nous n'avons vu personne dans cette maison pendant 4 jours. Décevant par rapport à notre envie de rencontrer des locaux ou autres voyageurs.
2016-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,9848837,Frances,"Hi , Really enjoyed staying in this beautiful house. It looked just as good as the pictures and everything was nice and clean. The garden was beautiful, really well done. It was close to the beach. 
Frances. "

2018-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,13595339,Corina,"A cute little studio in the heart of Elizabeth Bay - close to transport, and a wide array of delicious food options. Mariana is a great host, who has included small touches (eg powerboard next to bed so you can charge multiple devices at once) which make the studio even more comfortable. Amazing bath/shower!"
2018-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Michael,We had the room located at the ground floor with enough space for all our 3 luggage. The place is clean and the owner comes pretty much everyday and refills whatever needs to be like soap toilet paper etc... My girlfriend felt bad by the time of our arrival and he managed to let us in earlier than check in time. Really appreciated it! Thanks for a nice stay.
2015-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Barbara,"Cathy's fully self-contained studio apartment has the comfort and stylishness of an inner-city space. Step outside and you are graced with the stunning scenery of a wilderness landscape. Then head down to the Avalon shops and you have the atmosphere of a friendly village. 

I had the most magnificent mid-week break at Cathy's apartment. She and the sweet (and useless-as-a-guard-dog) Maggie were welcoming and friendly.

I can not recommend Cathy's place enough. It was rejuvenating. I live in the centre of Sydney, needed a break, so I headed north. The landscape, neighbourhood, people, food, everything was wonderful. And Cathy's kindness and her beautiful space just made it perfect.

I will be back. And soon. "
2018-11-15T05:00:00.000Z,22268452,舒謙,"房間位置有點尷尬,是跟屋主的房間連在一起(就是要進去房間時會先經過屋主的房間的意思),有隔著門但沒有鎖｡浴室也沒有鎖(很怕用到一半有人突然進來)｡會介意的人可能要考慮一下
在浴室看到不少小蟑螂
房間空間很小(除了床剩下一條小走道,大概跟床一樣長,跟枕頭的長一樣寬),無法打開2個人的行李箱,不太方便,當時我們是把一個人的行李箱放在外面,要拿東西的時候打開,拿完再關起來｡
洗澡的時候熱水大概7分鐘就會沒有,當時洗完頭髮還沒洗澡就沒熱水
離市區有一段距離,但交通還算方便,出去走5分鐘就有通往市區的公車,走8分鐘就有渡輪可以到環形碼頭
跟機場的交通比較麻煩,要轉2-3次的大眾運輸"
2019-01-18T05:00:00.000Z,13333143,Sandra,Ziggys place is really close to the surf and lots of food outlets. Very safe and clean. Nice gym on site.

2017-04-19T04:00:00.000Z,17757543,Rachel,"Emma's White House was perfect for my husbands long stay for work purposes.
He had everything he needed and Na (the host) was awesome.... extremely pleasant and helpful. She always made sure that his stay was comfortable. Communication was prompt and efficient.
The location was quiet, safe and close to amenities. The unit is away from the house and he wasn't disturbed by noise.
It was fantastic value for money and he would most definitely stay here again. I highly recommend this Airbnb to others. 
Thanks Na for making the time away from home so pleasant. "

2015-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Christine,"Beautiful view. The apartment is spacious and right next to the beach.  But I'm confused why we received the keys in a coded box when it seems the hosts were staying close enough to the apartment to watch us and count how many people we had entering the apartment. We had a lunchtime BBQ with family from the city and were trying to take advantage of a beautiful spot but were interrupted on two occasions by the hosts driving to the apartment to tell our friends and family to leave the premises. We had no intention of breaching the six sleeper agreement and can't understand why a group of up to 15 people having a BBQ in the middle of the day is inappropriate or warrants the hosts' interruptions . If the hosts intended on being so strict with the number of people visiting, it would have made more sense for them to have advised us of their concerns when handing over the keys."
2016-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Damian,"Wow wee!! What a brilliant time away. Geoff and Angela's place is just 'Brilliant', from the outdoor alfresco living space to the master bedroom suite, these areas are just perfect!
Oops I forgot to mention the beautiful back garden as well!

2019-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,21281467,Jade,"Ben's place is really cool.  Very high tech. TVs in every bedroom and living room. It's on the 3rd floor of an older building with a great front view to the bay which brings a nice breeze.  It's convenient located to bars, laundry and the ferry. The ferry journey to CBD is just amazing. A must do. It's very quiet to sleep even with the windows open. During the day though there is noise from the cars passing in the busy road."

I had friends staying in an executive sweet at the Hilton (just around the corner) and the view from Pamela and Hugo’s unit was much better!!  I would rate my stay 10/10.

2018-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,20374683,Jessie,As soon as you walked in everything was absolutely spotless. Quick responses by Phan. A lot of space which I was presently surprised about. Great stay overall. Will definitely be back if we are in that area again.
2016-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Stu,"We had a lovely time at Susan and Gregg's beach studio. We were made to feel very welcome, the studio was immaculate and every morning we had a basket of fresh bread and jams left outside our door.

The studio is nestled under trees which keeps it cool, along with the ceiling fan above the bed.

Bronte is a peaceful suburb that is perfectly positioned for everything. The Bondi and Coogee walk is a must and Bronte is on route along that walk.

Thank you Susan and Gregg for being a wonderful part of our three week Oz adventure. :-)"
2017-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,17757543,Amit,"It was an amazing experience to stay at Na's place. She is very hospitable and understanding. I booked the place for 15 days but i had to reduce the stay due to some personal emergency and it was very gracious of Na to accent the modification.

The  place was very clean and a must stay if you are around that area.
I would highly recommend Na's place.

Thanks a lot Na."
2017-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Kim,"The house was nothing like the listing. It was filthy dirty and smelled of urine and was over run with cock roaches. It was un hygienic and uninhabitable, we had to seek alternative accomodation and are requesting a full refund......"
2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,2889953,Geul,"1. The room is more spacious than it looks in the picture and the ceilling fan will keep the room cool. 2. You can either take a bus and a ferry or a bus and a train to get to the city. There are less frequent bus from the station to the place at night so you should probably check it in advance. From Strathfield, it takes roughly 20 mins by bus. 3. You can find lots of affordable/good Korean eateries in the near area as there is a hugh korean community. 4. If you are looking for super convinient place, this is not for you but if you like staying away from the coty"

There are fruit, milk and bread provided as breakfast. It's very convenient place for tripper. There are also a dog and a cat live in there.  If you are an animal lover.

Cozy place with great views.. we loved looking out the windows at the comings and goings of the street below. Also very centrally located, it was easy getting anywhere!

Ann is a wonderful and interesting host with great historical knowledge of the local area. Meal time was fun; some of the food picked from the garden, the rest fresh, delicious and made to suit my individual requirements. Eating breakfast overlooking a pretty garden and watching the river made a pleasurable start to each day. My bed was comfortable and as promised by my host, big soft towels to use in the shared bathroom. The house itself is as interesting as its gracious host and well worth the short ferry ride to visit and stay in for a night or two. Most enjoyable!"

It was clean, comfortable and quiet and only a few minutes walk from the sailing club where I was attending a wedding reception. It's not a big space but has everything you need for a short stay and I would readily recommend it.
Cathy was great with her directions and communication leading up to my stay. Oh and the surrounding area, all the huge mature eucalypts and down by the water are just beautiful. Thank's Cathy..

We didn't spend a lot of the time at the house, but enjoyed the fact is was reasonably close to Randwick Racecourse (what we were there for) and not too far away from the city.  

If you go there, make sure you check out the Spanish Restaurant just around the corner.  It was absolutely superb.  "

2017-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Colette,Only stayed overnight. Arrived very late like midnight and had to carry 30kg or more up the stairs. Met Hernan the next morning and he allowed me to keep my luggage stored there for half the day which was great. The street noise was loud but i was exhausted from 22 hrs flying and slept uninterrupted. Hernan is a very nice guy and good communication.
2017-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,5581269,Jeff,"Michy was very welcoming and our accommodation was perfect for visiting family , kicking back and taking in the wonderful environment in and around Clareville.
The cabin was spotless , bed was very comfortable with everything we required. We had a hire car but a bus stop was right out front for trips to the city or nearby Avalon and beyond.
Area was restful and we felt right at home with privacy but knowing Paul and Michy were a text away if required.
We would certainly recommend this cabin to others and would like to visit again soon."

The house itself is nice with everything there that you would need. The garage is really handy, albeit with a bit maneuvering required to get the car in if you have a longer car due to the back lane being fairly narrow.

We didn't have any interaction with Simone but she left us a bottle of wine, some milk and a great welcome pack with guides to house, shop, transport, etc., but everything was there so no interaction was required."

The host was very helpful and available to assist if needed. The apartment is compact but with a range of facilities, including really good internet connection which was much appreciated.  There was traffic noise even on 34th floor with the windows closed, but it did not stop us  getting a sound sleep.   We were there during a heatwave, and one night was quite hot.  Otherwise, the cross breeze at night cooled the apartment and we were mostly out during the day.  The bed was comfortable.   We only had one access card to the building which at times was limiting if we wanted to go out separately.   A great place to stay and the view made up for the minor inconveniences such as traffic noise. "

2018-04-24T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Deb,"This apartment was spacious enough for us all... 2 adults and 5 teenagers.  The highlight was being able to sit on one of the 2 balconies and watch the action in darling harbour and the city streets.  The added bonus of pool, spa, sauna and gym was great.  Close enough to walk to the main attractions of sydney (bridge, opera house, eye tower, fish market, circular quay etc...and so many great places to eat, plus close to the main train stations).  The apartment itself could use a bit of maintenance, but was comfortable and neat.  Danny is a great host and communicates quickly."

The attention to detail in the apartment is great, it has everything you need to make the most of your stay, it has a lot to offer. It is very quiet for its location, we never heard any noise during the day/night from inside the apartment. I highly recommend staying here for any couple!

2018-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,20906942,Pauline,"Great location and base to explore the city, near the central station, short walk to Darling Harbour.
The flat is as you can see on the pictures, nice, modern and spacious. 
The kitchen is relatevely well equipped for some small cooking or breakfast. There are also really good place for coffee and breakfast right around the corner. 
The host is really reactive and nice, indications to find and access the appartment were clear and easy. Check-in was smooth. 
Only the cleanliness was not up to my preference."

2016-08-02T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Mo,"The room really has a great view and the location is perfect. 
But we were not really impressed since it was fairly dirty (dog hair in the room, on the bed, hair in the sink, dust) which just didn't fit the to the otherwise very modern place. 
Then what I found most random and I have stayed at many many airbnb, that 6 out of 8 pictures of the place are of parts which you never going to see. Its totally alright to say ""we do not share kitchen and living room"" and the apartment is perfect for that since you have your own space upstairs but why advertise then with all these pictures? I think that is a bit misleading. 
Otherwise it's a great place but needs some improvements again after a high number of guests."
2017-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,其,"Paul and Judith :
Thank you very much for everything you have done for us, please forgive me, because my English too bad, can't express my thanks to you.House clean, beautiful, convenient and provide us with a lot of help.Very happy to be living here.You are welcome to come to China ,I miss you guys paul  Judith and every things in the house.living here days will be the best pary of my memory."

2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,15806964,Clayton,"Beautiful studio nestled in the hills of famous Bondi Beach.. need I say more?

This is the perfect spot for a couple looking to get away yet still in the best location. The apartment has everything you need to live comfortably. It's clean, stylish with tasteful styling/furnishes, and has inspiring views. You'll be close to dozens of cafe's restaurants, shops, bars, and the beach. I was particularly taken back by the quality and quality of restaurants, the food here is amazing and the coffee is unbeatable.

Communication by the host is was great, check-in/out was a breeze with the host giving a personalized walk through of the location and amenities. I was even offering a late check-out without asking.

It's easy to say that I will be looking forward to staying here again in the near future. Enjoy!"
2017-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,13689460,Vicky,"Hayley's place is very well located, close to Museum Station, which makes it very easy to get to the airport or the city centre.  Also close to Hyde Park, Oxford Street but best of all Crown Street - this is a great street with plenty of restaurants!   There are also supermarkets close by if required (for fruit / snacks).  Place is really nice and quiet, bed is huge and comfy, slept really well.  I only stayed 2 nights but enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend this place.  "

Highly recommended!"

2018-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,22068048,David,What a great place you both have. Close to the things we need and affordable. Very well appointed and nice to have a place to sit and relax with your own hot drink at the end of a long day.
2014-10-20T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Anna,"Naveen and Tris are absolutely delightful hosts. I had such a great stay with them. This was my first airbnb experience, so I had no idea what to expect and I was blown away by how well it all worked out.

Their place was exactly as described and as per the pictures. Location is fabulous - right in the thick of all the action in Darlinghurst and walking distance to everywhere I needed to go during my stay. 

The guest room is stunning - super comfy bed with high quality linen etc. Spotlessly clean and the most amazing view from the floor to ceiling window. Guests have their own private bathroom which again was spotless, great water pressure etc. Naveen has thought of all the little details - there is even a box of hotel style toiletries/amenities for guests to use. Their dog Felix is super cute and very well behaved.

I was very busy during my stay, but Naveen and Tris were very relaxed about me doing my own thing. They took me to a local cafe for a great coffee on my last morning and it was really nice to get to know them a bit. 

Tris even went out his way to drive me to the airport when we found out that trains weren't running. I really felt like I was staying with friends. I found them very easy to communicate with when booking and Naveen responded promptly to all of my messages. 

Would absolutely stay here again and have already recommend this property to friends who are planning trips to Sydney. "
2015-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Barbara,"Key was ready for us.  Book of information was provided and we were made to feel welcome.

Many thanks, Mal."

The bedroom has all you'll need and Herman provided me with an extra blanket and a heater since its was a little cold when I was there. Thanks again for a wonderful stay!
2017-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Lois,GREAT place to stay. You could actually walk to intl airport if are backpacking. Bathroom and shower spotless along with room. Food and train about 5 blocks away. Recommend this to anyone

2019-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,928035,Wojtek And Ewa,"Simone's home is perfect - well appointed, excellent location with great shopping, food and transport just around the corner.  Easy 20 minute bus trip to the center of the city, 5 minutes to Coogee beach. The house was the ideal base for our family when attending our son's wedding.  We were able to have friends over between wedding and reception as there were plenty of glasses, cups etc and a beautiful lounge and dining area to entertain in. As it was  quite hot the air conditioning and fans in all bedrooms were most welcome. Communication with Simone was effortless and we greatly appreciated the special touches and care shown for our special circumstances.."

The house is stylishly appointed, and we really appreciated three bathrooms plus a kitchen. The stairs are steep but for my kids it was no bother. The home has been renovated to a high standard. Our communication was fast and quick, and it was a pleasure to stay at Philip's place."
2017-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Kari,Very enjoyable stay! Communication with David was great.  Very bright and welcoming... walking distance to main attractions and very close to kings cross train station.

Netheid liet wel iets te wensen over"

It is just off the Corso so was not at all noisy, it was a very secure, clean, and well appointed apartment for 2 people, close to both beaches, ferries and public transport etc.  The neighbourhood was friendly (cafe owners were OK for us to squat for an hour waiting for our transit to airport) people were helpful and we found great places to eat only minutes away. Can highly recommend Ziggy's apartment in Manly. a top spot!

2016-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Nicole,"Great little cottage. Perfect for a family. We stayed with our 2 kids,  (3 & 6yrs )  for one night and had everything we could need.  Located in the host's  back yard on a quiet suburban street.  Surrounded by houses yet was very private. The local shopping centre with Coles just a few km's away.  We were very happy with our 1st Airbnb experience and when we next need accommodation in Sydney will try to book again. "

2018-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,18047246,Yang,"The room is tidy and clean, with separate toilet and bathroom. It’s a good place to stay for a couple or a single person.  Ven is a very nice person. 
We had a little difficult to find the house when checked-in, because the street number is not included in the address. We had to call Ven to get exact address.  The bedroom door has a screaming sound when opening and closing, so it was embarrassing when we would like to use the door at early morning or at night.  It would be better if it’s been fixed.
Overall, it’s a comfortable place to stay."
2018-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,1229797,Nathalie,"Very friendly and helpful couple, also the place is great and looks like the pictures. Would recommend it for people with smaller luggage though because the room is on the 2nd floor"

The place was really nice inside and very clean. A great little spot with it's own access and just accross from the beautiful Pittwater. Avalon cafes and restaurants had us covered all weekend and the weather really turned on for us while we were there. Can't recommend it highly enough, definitely no compaints."
2017-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Michelle,"What a great location, with a generous sized house.  The kitchen, dining and living rooms are very comfortable sizes, and a bonus for each bedroom to have its own level, two with balconies.

The location made for a convenient base to access both the city and the nearby surrounds of the eastern suburbs. 
The studio itself had all the facilities we needed for our stay with the decor and lighting creating the relaxing coastal oasis that we were after - even a tasty local breakfast was provided as a bonus! Thank you Susan, was so lovely meeting you and feeling so welcomed into Bronte."

The area is quiet and safe, with very nice neighborhood. I already look forward to another stay at Louise apartment."
2018-06-26T04:00:00.000Z,16651655,Louis,Good value for the price.
2016-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Kim,"Shuang was very helpful in providing instructions and tips to getting to his place. The room itself is very clean, spacious, and modern. The neighborhood is pretty quiet and the person/people I shared the kitchen and bathroom with were very considerate and quiet. Getting around was pretty easy as it was only a 12 minute walk from Wolli Creek station and shorter walk to a few bus routes that will take you to Sydney or surrounding suburbs. My stay was very short as I was heading to the airport, and it's a relatively easy walk to the airport if you don't have too much luggage. Otherwise, it's an inexpensive taxi ride or short bus trip to the airport, which works just as well. Would definitely try to stay here again if I'm ever in the area again."
2016-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,15650737,Mark,"Sarah is lovely, but she hadn't attended to some very basic maintenance."

2016-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Nikki,Richard's place is pure serenity. Private beach front this house is perfect for a relaxing get away and the kitchen is incredible. Everything you need! The beds are comfortable and the whole area is so serene. Perfect for a little getaway from Sydney! Can't wait to come back.
2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Richard,Great location and excellent value
2016-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Jennifer,"We stayed in Paul's place for six nights and had a wonderful time. The flat is compact, comfortable, and stylish. There is a bathroom with bath and shower as well as WC. there is a kitchen with a gas cooker, a dining table which can seat four, and a dressing room with good storage space. It is perfect for one or two. The location is in potts point, just three minutes walk from kings cross station. You can walk into the centre of sydney in 20 minutes. There are big supermarkets within ten minutes walk of the apartment.

2018-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Sam,"The apartment was just as it is advertised,great time,fantastic location and we highly recommend it.

2018-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,6785160,Alexandra,"I was meeting friends in Newtown so location for me was great. It's also only a short walk to the station from where you can go straight to circular quay. Bed was really comfortable and everywhere was very clean. 
Would stay again and definitely recommend."
2017-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Ross,"Great host. Great and prompt/easy communication. Very polite. Only issues were very small and very much a personal opinion, you have to walk through the house to get the the little cabin out the back (Susan just said g'day when we walked through and very much gave us our space after a long drive, she was very chill about us walking through at any time of the night even through we were in early and out at a reasonable time) and the planes going to/from the airpott can be a bit of pain. But the cabin out the back is beautiful, very clean everything you need shes helpful to let you know as you get there etc. 
Definitely will look her up again!"
2016-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,13852692,Crystal,"It is a nice place, our family enjoy the stay very much. The host is very helpful when we have some questions. "
2015-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,6046461,Isabelle,"Suzie was most welcoming, and our first Airbnb experience couldn't have gone better. The apartment is exquisitely furnished and feels very homey. It's posh yet comfy. The bed (including the bedding) is on par with upper-scale hotels. Suzie gave us a lot of privacy but was readily available to answer any question. The bathroom for our own usage also has the feel of chic hotels, with an assortment of high-end products. The location is great, between Wynward Station and Darling Harbour. The room is next to a road, but soundproofing is good and I slept well even without using ear plugs (Suzie provides high quality ear plugs should you need them). To sum up, my sister and I would go back in a heart beat.  "
2017-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,13562321,Evandro,"The apartament is very good. It is very close bars, restaurant and metro station. It is perfect for a couple. The apartment does not receive much sunligh. But this is not a problem. I and my girlfriend recomend the Joanne apartament. Everthing is good."
2014-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Julie,We've stayed a few times with Kerri.  She's a great host and her apartment is lovely.  We're happy to recommend and look forward to our next visit.
2017-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Graeme,"We spent a very comfortable 8 nights in Desiree's apartment.  It is just as it looks in the pictures.  It is smartly decorated with comfortable furniture and lovely modern kitchen and bathroom.  There is a guest laundry in the building with coin operated machines and you can do a big wash and dry for $4 each.  The apartment is bright and airy and has a nice busy city outlook which we enjoyed.  You can certainly hear the buzz of the city around you but you are right in the CBD so that is to be expected and enjoyed.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to just about everything in the city centre and trains and buses are only metres away if you want to get around more quickly or go further afield.  Very easy access from the airport by train into Museum station. The host, Desiree, was a pleasure to deal with, excellent communication all the way through.  This is a wonderful little home away from home putting you right into centre of the Sydney action."

Close proximity for me and my plans in Olympic Park. Many thanks for the help with transport in the area. I would happily stay with you in he future.
2015-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Ian,"Tristan made us feel very welcome upon arrival, showed us everything we'd need and recommended a great place to have breakfast! Although we unfortunately didn't end up meeting Naveen, she was very helpful over the phone! 

The apartment was exactly what we were looking for, the use of the gym and outside pool (with stunning views across the city and harbour bridge) are a great addition! We loved the style of the apartment too, very cool. 

Loved Darlighurst, conveniently located when travelling into the City and not too far from Bondi. 

We would highly recommend staying with Tristan & Naveen!"

It also included a beach bag and towels, little kitchen set up, even yogurt and strawberries in the fridge. Along with Cathy’s wonderful recommendations for food in the area our stay couldn’t have been better. I would highly recommend staying here!"

Clovelly is great, the house area was quiet at night and during the day with easy walking distance to the beach and restaurants. Also very close by to public transport (fundamental in Sydney) and for us that drove there, free and easy to find parking in the same street. We did love it the stay. "
2018-04-12T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Natalie,Best Airbnb I have stayed in in Sydney! Will stay again
2018-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,27009904,Xochitl,"Best hospitality ever, love the cleanliness and tidiness of this place. No shoe policy is my way to go in my house, so I appreciate having it in places where I travel to. 
The place is brand new and well maintained, bed is comfy. Linen soft and clean. I forgot my converter for the outlet and they had two available! Life savers! I would define you highly recommend it to anybody!"
2016-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,6785160,Vanessa,"I was delighted with my stay. Carol and Steve are kind and thoughtful hosts. Beautiful rooms and bathroom, very clean.

2018-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,4502957,Jennifer,"Beautiful and cozy house in the most amazing location, just minutes from Bondi restaurants, shops and the beach! The kitchen was very well stocked, with beautiful little touches arranged for our arrival. We were made to feel very welcome! Having the entire house meant our family of five could relax with enough room! I thoroughly recommend booking this place!"
2017-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Tristan,"The studio is very cosy and in a great location. The light rail is just a short walk away and I found it very easy to get to everything. If you're driving, as I was, there is always a park on the street and you are just off a major arterial road (without any noise!). Susan was a lovely host, very friendly and accommodating, which made my first AirBnB experience very smooth and pleasant. Would recommend!"

Our communication are very smooth, no problem at all. It must be one of my favourite airbnb stay! Thank you for the lovely flowers and chocolates. Highly recommend to stay in Desireé 's place for your next accommodation! "
2015-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Stacy,"This apartment is clean, modern, and comfortable.  We appreciated the thorough communication and ease of hand-off for the keys.  We were especially grateful for the toiletries, guidebooks, laundry powder, and coffee provided - the attention to detail was wonderful!  The building requires the key to use the elevator, so we felt very secure. We would stay here again!  Be aware that the 1BD is separated by a partial wall, so if you're looking for privacy from the living room, it is limited.

We enjoyed staying in Surry Hills. It is convenient being so close to Central Station.  It seems to be an up and coming neighborhood so I would advise others that you should assess your level of comfort with urban life. By day, I noticed all of the cute restaurants, yoga/barre spots, and shops. (Simon and Nicole provided excellent recommendations as well!) By night, I noticed more of the remaining graffiti, vacant storefronts, and quiet streets.  If you do not feel comfortable in cities or would feel more assured with constant tourist traffic, you may want to spend more to be closer to CBD. For us, it was perfect.  Thanks Simon and Nicole!"
2015-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Cindy,바로 앞에 바다도 있고 조금만 가면 시티도 있고 너무 좋은 곳이었어요! 집도 아기자기하고 인테리어도 이뻐서 너무 맘에 들었답니다 편하게 잘 쉬었어요

2018-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Nathalie,"Super emplacement! À 5 minutes du métro de Kings Cross et de 3 épiceries. 

Grande chambre et salon. Beaucoup de rangement.
Même le futon était confortable. 

Cuisine fonctionnelle mais peu équipée. Avec un peu de créativité, on se débrouille bien. 

Petite salle de bains, pas de porte de douche et l'eau s'étend sur le plancher. Mais comme il y a très peu de pression, ce n'est pas trop problématique. 

Bruits de la rue et du corridor très perceptibles, bouchons pour les oreilles conseillés. 

Le logement prend la température de l'extérieur. Heureusement, il y avait des couvertures supplémentaires et un chauffage d'appoint portatif. 

J'y séjournerait de nouveau sans problème!"

There's a bus stop right at the front door, which is great since Australia's public transportation system is so convienant . Theres a fun lively area right near there with bars and restaurants. Getting in contact with Cindy was very easy. I would stay at Cindy's again. "

Highly recommend this place to anyone."
2014-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,4164487,Kim,"Duncan and Ashlee provide a lovely room and good, friendly experience and stay.

The room is very clean and set up perfectly for arrival with a lot of space to store personal items and clothes. Everything was made easy and hassle-free, and the location itself is perfect for a quick tram or bus into town, so it easy to find be first time also. 

We didn't get to chat much with the hosts as we were coming and going and exploring, but we enjoyed our short time spent in their company.

We recommend this place for all aspects of a stay, and would be happy to stay longer than the 4 nights we had there. "

Her little backyard cabin is just perfect and provides a serene, private and relaxing green oasis so close to the centre of Sydney.  Susan willingly shares her kitchen facilities and makes her place feel like a home away from home.  It is very convenient and within easy walking distance to buses and the shops, restaurants and amenities of Leichhardt.  I highly recommend Susan's cabin and will definitely consider staying here again."

Steeped in art and history and only one street back from Oxford St (and the delightful Saturday Paddington markets) I couldn't have picked a better place to stay. There's two Airbnb rooms who share the beautiful stone bathroom but I rarely noticed the other guests, the room I had isn't pictured but had a great feel with gorgeous natural light and plenty of space. Arnie and Lorraine felt like old friends after my week there and I'll definitely be back! "
2017-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Stefan,"Sehr freundlicher Empfang mit einer super Einweisung in die Unterkunft. Mit weiteren Infos zu den direkten Örtlichkeiten, Stränden, öffentliche Verkehrsanbindung (Schiffsfähre) und den Sehenswürdigkeiten des wunderschönen Naturparks. 
Das eigenständige absolut ruhig gelegene Appartementhaus entsprach meiner Meinung nach zu 100% der Gastgeberbeschreibung und ist modern mit guter technischer und wohnlicher Ausstattung versehen. 
Es war sogar möglich kurzzeitig eine 3. Person in Abstimmung mit der Gastgeberin übernachten zu lassen. Insgesamt betrachtet war der Urlaubsaufenthalt hier einzigartig, in einem liebevoll ausgestattetem Ambiente inmitten von grüner Natur und Stränden.   "

2016-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Phearern,"Linda was a great host and regularly kept in contact to ensure we were having a great time and there were no issues.

Everything was as described and the location was great. The walk to the train station was not too far; even with a crying infant and suit cases being wheeled. Great restaurants were only a short walk away as well.

The information left in the house for nearby attractions and was great, as was the access to the Entertainment Book.

I would highly recommend staying here. 

The next time we are in Sydney, Linda's apartment will be the first place we will try and book :)"
2016-03-12T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Natasha,"Really nice place to stay, it's nice to be self-contained, basically like a little hotel room with plenty of space and a nice garden. Kitchen amenities available in house. Susan was nice and welcoming. Good location in Sydney too. To be honest the aeroplane noise was a bit of a shock at first but I was tired so I still slept really well from about 9-6 without being woken."
2017-11-06T05:00:00.000Z,10091713,Rekha,Ben's place was very comfortable and close to all public transport and commercial points. We had a wonderful stay. Apartment was very well equipped. Ben was also very quick in response for qns we had on any facility at home.

2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,16070079,晔,The host canceled this reservation 44 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2018-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Bob,"well situated for railway station and in a safe up and coming area with a real sense of history, the flat is comfortable and has everything you would need for any length of stay, bed is comfortable and having two toilets is a bonus.
No problem with noise (except the stairs which do creak a bit) and plenty of fans to keep cool in both lounge and bedroom.
Linda responded very quickly to any questions and we would recommend the apartment."
2018-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Evita,"This was a perfect location and a wonderful apartment. We plan to visit Sydney more often and have found our place. 
Chloe is great with communication and the check in was super easy."

2016-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Tim,"Great spread in a lively neighborhood. Walking distance to train and myriad bars/restaurants. I've been to Sydney 10 times, but somehow never visited Darlinghurst till now. (Thanks, Airbnb!) Naveen could not have been more accommodating--she even helped me sort out the train times for my pre-dawn airport schlep. Will return! "
2014-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,1310308,Thomas,"Cute apartment in a great neighborhood.  It has all the essentials, minus wifi.  A good bet for your money."
2017-11-05T04:00:00.000Z,20906942,Rachel,"As per previous comments, issues with cleanliness and lack of crockery/towels upon arrival. Able to contact owner and he provided new towels, coffee cups, dishrack, tea towels etc the first morning and provided a small refund which was appreciated.  Main bed is soft but comfortable.  Very convenient location, mostly walked to nearby places or into town.  Easy to get to/from airport."
2018-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,18315277,Loz,"Very clean place and in awesome location. Although, parking says free all day, it doesn't mention you need to move your car every 2 hours every day you stay there - ruins your time if you do not know of this, we left a day early. 

Bring toilet paper and soap as these were not available at our stay. (they said they would reimburse us of the toilet paper) "
2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Brittany,"Susan is a lovely host with a lovely home! Very helpful and welcoming. Directly underneath a flight path so it was a little noisy but love the Eco-friendliness of the place, and Angelo the cat :)"
2015-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Ben,Belinda was very accommodating and it was a nice relaxed spot!

2017-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,18338274,Nicholas,"Do yourself a favour and stay at Bills house. The locations in Glebe is wonderful, close to the city and Glebe but in a gorgeous quiet location. The house is really big and allows a large group to expand into the space. Bill is a very accommodating host. Thanks for everything."

2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,18160399,Nathanaëlle,Appartement parfait pour trois personnes ou couple + 1 enfant. Littéralement à deux pas de la station de train Hurlstone Park sur la ligne T3 qui amène au cœur de Sydney donc très pratique pour visiter la ville tout en étant au calme. Quartier résidentiel très calme avec petits commerces dans la rue adjacente et parc pas loin. Bref idéal pour aller découvrir Sydney en étant dans un petit coin calme. Rien à redire sur la propreté des lieux. Nous ne nous sommes pas croisés avec Angelina mais elle a su répondre à toutes nos demandes. Merci à elle et sa famille pour ce séjour.
2018-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,21637487,Hubertus,"Great apartment, fantastic location.. like the style and it is renovated very nicely. Enjoyed to jump out of the door into the ocean and to have all the nice cafes and restaurants around"
2018-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,23510317,Brenda,"Jason and David were very responsive hosts and facilitated an easy check in process despite arriving quite late at night. The loft was in a great location, central to public transport and walking distance to some yum eateries. Amenities in the loft were quite basic which was not too problematic as we did not spend much time physically there. Due to the proximity of the neighbours, it was not uncommon to be woken up early if the neighbours were up and about. All in all, an adequate place to return to after a long day of adventuring the city."
2017-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Telshani,It was a warm and cosy stay! Loved the place! It was soo clean! Probably the cleanest place I have ever seen.Communication was fast and good. Easy checkout and checkin.Highly recommend this place! :)

Apartment very freshly decorated with scented flowers and candle.
Very good appliances with ample kitchen utensils and tableware.
More than sufficient consumables such as milk, refreshments, bathroom and laundry products.
Towels and linen immaculate."
2016-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Marjorie,"Lovely apartment in a very convenient part of Sydney. Five minutes from the Town Hall and QVB and about 20 minutes from Circular Quay. Lots of food and drink outlets in the immediate vicinity.  The apartment was clean and well equipped with amazing views over the harbour and Botanic Gardens. Hugo's instructions for getting in and using the apartment were clear and helpful. Bonus is the roof top terrace and swimming pool, which unfortunately we didn't have time to use!  Many thanks Hugo and Pamela"
2018-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,20206764,Gem,Definitely recommend this place- perfect beach pad and we didn’t want to leave :) very comfortable and hospitable.

Everything was perfect! We really hope to go back there sometime soon!
Thank you!"
2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,30412858,Kerrie,"On the positive side the apartment was in a fabulous location - close to attractions, restaurants and shopping. The check-in was seamless, despite my concerns about picking up keys from a convenience store. The apartment came with parking -  a real bonus in this area of Sydney. It took me 2 turns to find the carpark, but that was my fault I should have watched the video Angela provided on the day rather than a few days before. The apartment was very well equipped - dishwasher, washing machine and dryer etc. The beds were very comfy. Really good Wifi. 
On the negative side I was disappointed that we were only given one bath towel each (for a 4 night stay) and a fairly thin towel at that. No hand towels or face washers. The apartment was clean but could probably do with a spruce up as it looked a little tired. 
My big problem was the TV. It didn't work. When my husband telephoned one of the contact people he received a telephone call back saying that he couldn't help us and would get someone to look at it the next day - a bit too late as we were leaving the next morning. He also told my husband that he had spoken to the Concierge at the building and that a number of apartments were have antenna problems. We then tried to tune  the TV again and were able to ""find"" over 200 channels - but all of them were locked, including the free to air channels. 
My husband contacted the second contact person and he got back to us and said he couldn't understand why we were having problems as the family that had moved out that morning didn't have any issues. This was a complete lie - we had been in the apartment for the last three nights. 
I don't like people lying to me. Why not simply say that you can't rectify the problem, apologise for the inconvenience and leave it at that.  It wouldn't have been any big deal.
Finally I don't like hosts asking me (on several occasions) to give them a 5 star rating. I only give honest feedback."
2018-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Yvonne,"This apartment is fantastic value, in a great location to enjoy Middle Harbour, Manly Beach and the Spit Bridge to Manly walk... which is spectacular. 
Comfy beds, spacious bathroom, practical kitchen and GREAT harbour VIEW.  Perfect location for using public transport.  Hope to stay again."
2017-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Blandine,"Je recommande vivement ce logement magnifiquement bien situé à proximité du Royal National Park, confortable et décoré avec beaucoup de goût.

2016-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,13562321,Jillian,"The place was spacious and comfortable but the best part about it is the location. It's in the center of town, making all the major destinations easily accessible. In addition, Ali and Joanne were very accommodating with our early check in. The amenities, however, were lacking. We were hoping to shower after our long flight but there were no bath towels when we arrived. I texted Ali and the towels were delivered while we were out for lunch. There was only one tube of shampoo and conditioner provided that were clearly taken from hotels. There was a bar of soap for bathing and it had obviously been used before. The previous things I can deal with, but for our 5 night stay for 2 people, there was only one and a half rolls of toilet paper. I texted Ali for toilet paper, shampoo, and soap twice, but received no response.

I loved the apartment, but it needs to be better stocked."

2016-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Kaylah,Susan was a lovely and welcoming host. The studio is well equipped with everything you need for your stay and it's a really convenient location for buses into the city.

2016-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,10108388,Janine,"My daughter and I came to Sydney for her medical school interview.  Desiree was an outstanding host - providing detailed instructions on every stage of our stay, including our last day where she kindly offered for us to check out later than the arranged time.  The apartment was immaculate and really did provide a home away from home. You could seriously just turn up at his place as everything is provided for the guest's use. Desiree thought of all the little special touches - from fresh fruit and sparkling water to chocolates and flowers.  The location is fantastic - walking distance to all that Sydney has to offer.   Her guide book and restaurant recommendations were wonderful.  Highly recommended  - better than any hotel stay!  We  will be back again!  Many thanks Desiree"
2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Marija Magdalena,"Belinda's little cottage was very cute and comfortable. 

For those spending the day out walking/going to the beach it's a great choice. 

The cottage is at the back of Belinda's house, which was clear on the listing, but might not be ideal for those wanting a place of their own."
2016-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Zhenhui,You can find everything in this house. 20min from dt. Near beach. Recommend.

2016-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Sarah,Cath was a great communicator and responded quickly to any questions. The studio was charming and a short walk to cafes and train stations etc. The breakfast muesli and freshly baked biscuits were delicious!
2019-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,24460520,Derek,"Julia’s place was great for my stay!  It was easy to get to by public transport from the airport and nicely located near the CBD and other areas.  While it did get warm during the day, you should be out exploring! And it cooled down nicely with the fan on and window open at night.  It was exactly as presented and a great spot for my first visit to Sydney.  Would definitely stay here again!"
2015-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,5461928,Paige,We had the best time & that was due to Stephanie's home & how at ease she made us feel. It was just like home away from home & Glebe is a beautiful suburb.

2015-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Sher Lyn,"My stay was a pleasant one. Hernan was very responsive to my queries. It was a shame though that I didn't get the chance to meet him. But still, overall I really had a pleasant stay in Hernan's place. The room was very clean and tidy, and he even provided the bus route information on the table in the room (just in case some people might need to refer it). Oh and one thing, his place is just about 10 minutes walk to the Beach. If you want a quiet time at a nice beach with lesser people, you should definitely check out Hernan's place! I would totally recommend his place to my friends (:"
2017-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,13595339,Mark,No views BUT perfect for single or couple who want to get out and about and come back to comfort and quiet. All the facilities cleverly included even basic food supplies included and great bathroom.
2017-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,15312988,Daphne,"The room was exactly as described, small but cozy and comfortable. Ideal for a short stay! It was very clean, and Cindy and Miki absolutely lovely hosts.
Located close to shops, restaurants and the beach it was only a short bus ride into central Sydney.
Highly recommend it!"
2018-03-08T05:00:00.000Z,1944996,Virginia,Great spot to stay! Annie is a great communicator and the studio is lovely. It’s a great and lively part of town to be in so highly recommend staying there if you want to experience a thriving part of Sydney.
2016-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Zi,"Nicole was great host with excellent communication before, during and after our stay, also welcomed us warmly on our arrival showing us every detail of the apartment and surrounding.

The place is just as good as on the pictures, and especially the bathroom to be underlined with amenities even more than you could need!

Location is great, close to central station, and Surry Hills is such a perfect place full of wonderful dinning spots. Make sure you follow Nicole's guide book, all her recommendations are golden words. We tried 4 restaurants from the book, fantastic!

We had very good time here. Highly recommended :D"
2018-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Jia,David’s house is in perfect location and close to everything you can ask for. In front of the building across the street there is a lovely cafe and you can enjoy a brunch in the open air with sunshine kissing your face. That’s also a plus for this house. The only thing that can be improved is the shower. It would’ve been perfect if it was strong enough.
2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Stephanie,"The apartment was beautiful! It was in an amazing location right in the center of things so it was easy to walk to many of the sights we wanted to visit. The train was also very close for when we needed it, and supermarkets and restaurants were easy to walk to. The door handle was loose which Gavin assured us he would fix. The apartment was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the kids loved the chocolates : )"
2015-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,394428,德衍,"We had really good time in this beautiful house. The pillows, sheets and towels are clean and smell good. Its location is good. We walked less than 10 mins from Petersham station. The host prepared some fresh fruits, milk and toast for us for breakfast and we liked it very much. We will choose here to stay if we come Australlia again."
2014-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Ben,"I stayed in this guest room end of December for three nights. I had an excellent stay here, my first Aibnb experience. David was a great host. The room was exactly as described. Clean, very near to city centre, own bathroom, ... I have not a single thing to complain about and would stay here again, should I travel again to Sydney."

Jamie was most welcoming and we had a great stay , although we were unlucky with the weather for a few days.
Would recommend this apartment for anyone who likes being near a beach."
2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,20578419,Rosie,"Fantastic location! Great place to stay if you're just looking for a comfortable bed and amenities such as a washing machine and dryer. After the cleaning fee and airbnb VAT fees, it cost $307 AUD a night, which is quite expensive compared to a hotel. But in saying that, you won't get some amenities mentioned and location may not be as ideal as Surry Hills. I was a little disappointed initially (looked better in the photos) but if you take into account this fantastic suburb location and want a clean and comfortable stay, then look no further. Lastly, it's a bit of an inconvenience with one set of keys when the listing stated two would be provided. The host did let us drop our luggage earlier but we couldn't officially check in til after 3pm."

Kitchen has good amenities which is great as restaurants are a little few and far between unless you go to the Sydney Olympic Park precinct. Yang is a wonderful host and is very attentive. The bed is a little small if you're tall but other than that absolutely amazing! Construction noise unavoidable but once finished won't be an issue. Highly recommend.
2017-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Miranda,"Mariana's place is convenient to everything and centrally located with only few mins walk from KC's station. The apartment is same as desceibed as beautifully Art decorated. The place is fabously clean!!! Love my stay in Sydney as well as this adorable airBnB. Thanks for the beautiful hydrangea in the apartment too. I would defintiely recommend to frds who visit Sydney! ❤️❤️❤️ 

Though I havent met Mariana in person, her partner Don has given me warm greetings and show me everything in the apartment. Plus, they are fine with my late checkin time, which I am very appreaciated!!!❤️"
2018-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Villalf,Fantastic location; My first time in Sydney and the apt is at the heart of almost everything. Such a convenience to go around
2017-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Cat,We stayed here a few nights in December. The apartment is really well designed with modern appliances and everything you need for short or long stay. The place is very quiet but still in an incredibly central location. Mariana was very quick in her communication and obliging in her hospitality. Highly recommended.
2018-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,19508741,Phillip,"Tess and Rod are wonderful hosts. We greatly appreciated the breakfast provided, as well as the chocolate cake. A wonderful place to stay in a great location."
2018-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Daniel,"We didn’t actually come across Tracey in our stay, but her Studio 32 flat is fantastic. It is very modern and very clean. It has a separate entrance down a back street for added privacy which is very secure. We drove and were able to park unmetered and untimed on a nearby street for the whole weekend (1 minute walk away).

Studio 32 is located above their garage (separate from the house) within easy walking distance to plenty of cafes, retail shops and restaurants. Lewisham train station is only about 10 minutes walk away.

Being under the flight path, it can be slightly noisy with planes overhead at times, but this is unavoidable and goes hand in hand with its fantastic location.

I’d highly recommend Studio 32 to others!"
2017-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,14223095,Meelika,The whole apartment was very nice and clean. Beautiful room and private bathroom. The bed in the room was out of this world comfortable. We enjoyed our stay very much :) Definitely recommend!
2017-10-18T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Anisha,"Great location, very convenient and everything you would need can be found in this apartment. For the location, the price is of amazing value. Walkable distance to the local attractions. Chloe is friendly and easy to communicate with, will definitely recommend her apartment for others seeking a central city abode that doesn't break the bank.  "
2016-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,15312988,Dung,"Cindy is lovely, easy going and very pleasant to talk to. The house was very cozy and clean. Slightly away from the city but has bus right outside that goes directly to the city which is very good. There are many buses slightly longer opposite which takes about 5-10min walk. In the same area, it has restaurants and other shops so it pretty good and near all you need. Close to beautiful Coogee beach as well. Nice to stay at Cindy place. "
2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,20374683,Wei,"凡姐的房子地理位置非常好,去任何地方步行即可到达,附近就有一家大超市,买东西吃饭都很方便!最赞的是凡姐个人的魅力,给了我们很大的帮助,真的是由衷的感谢!以后会再来入住,也会推荐朋友来入住!"

2015-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Gillian,"I headed directly here from the Airport by train, and it was very easy to find! It's literally beside the Petersham train station. When I got to the home, it was nice and quiet in the surroundings and I liked that very much. The room is as in photos, the bed was comfortable, there's a writing table which was helpful for me. Natasa was really really nice and whipped up dinner for me when I was starving the first night. You'll enjoy your stay here! :)"
2018-02-10T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Jorrit,"Great first stay in an AirBnB - David was easy to communicate with, friendly, and the checkin process was a breeze. The house and the room were great, in a perfect location and very neat and tidy."
2019-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,16234640,Kiran,It's a very pretty place. I would definitely recommend it.
2016-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Bradley,"Susan is a wonderful host! The studio is lovely and has everything you'd need for a comfortable stay. Very clean, and a very comfortable bed which is a huge plus. The garden rounds the whole place off and makes it that much more charming. Susan is very kind, and prompt about responding to any questions you might have. If I'm in Bronte again someday I'll definitely stay at her studio."
2015-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,7667264,Dee,"Isabella was so lovely from the point of booking and until my stay. Her response to my messages were prompt and thorough. Her instructions were detailed on where things are in the house and where nice eateries are around Newtown, I think this was very kind of her to do so. 

Isabella's house is in a very convenient location, and moreover her bedroom is an inspiration, so tidy and quaint! I was made to feel like I was at home, and the bath tub in the bathroom is an absolute treasure! I will definitely stay here again!"
2018-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,24916551,Kayden/Daryn,A great place. Perfect for our family that came to visit us during our working holiday. We had a great stay and the hosts were always ready to help answer questions or provide things.
2019-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,21648821,Nicole,Great location so close to East Village. Great spot between airport and town and safe area with great buses to town or Bondi.
2015-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Frank,"Dj is a nice host who provided warmest welcome and great hospitality. He self created a guide book to show me where to eat, to see and what to do in Sydney. He helped me to do laundry twice during my 5 day stay. He is place is well deco and quiet at night. The bed is extremely comfortable and I had good sleep every night. A nice place and I recommend his place to whoever Travelling to Sydney! "
2015-06-07T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Lubi,Arnie and his family are wonderful hosts. Making my guest feel welcome and comfortable with the level of support received prior and during stay. Thanks

2015-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,Raimi,"Fantastic location with spectacular views! Mal was very accomodating, meeting us on the day of arrival (even though we were late) and allowing for a later check out (was a lifesaver given our late flight out). Very well furnished and the perfect little getaway."
2017-05-25T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Leonie,A great location and all the amenities that you need in the apartment to have a comfortable and enjoyable stay.
2015-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,William,"A wonderfully renovated and very comfortable separate flat which we will look to stay at again. Michy and Paul were very nice and accommodating people who went out of their way to ensure we were ok with everything. The location is in a quiet and very pretty surrounding which in future when we have more time we would like to explore more.
Overall a very pleasant experience which we would recommend to anyone and everyone."
2016-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Reyzana,"Great stay! Room was clean, WiFi available, amenities and towels provided. Hernan was friendly and flexible. Would 100% stay again!"

2017-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,19376053,Sarah,The apartment was great - clean and had everything we needed. It’s located in an area where you have everything at your door step and a short few mins walk to the central train station made getting around so much easier. We had some weather issues with our flight on arrival but Andrew and his team were very accommodating with our check in. Would definitely stay again.
2018-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Aramburu,perfect location.
2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,9080393,Harley,"Great house , tony was very nice and helpful when needed , would definitely stay there again"
2018-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,6785160,Jeff,Carole is a very generous host. The accommodation is of a very high standard and so close to everything in the City. Great neighborhood with a lot of interesting things to do. All our needs were well catered for. Thank you so much. Definitely recommend Caroles place.
2017-06-01T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Julian,"Great place with a great location, close to Sydney Harbour, would definitely stay again. The hosts were really nice."

2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,20578419,Sophie,"Su’s apartment is in an amazing location, just a 30-minute walk from Circular Quay and close to lots of lovely restaurants. Apartment is really lovely and Su and the team were so accommodating about letting us check in early. A great stay."
2019-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,22661818,Darhim,Location was perfect. Dedicated parking spot was vital for us as we had a car and the area was super busy. The balcony with the awesome view is where we spent most of our time. I also liked the utility room downstairs which had a shower for us to clean off the sand from the beach.
2017-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Mary,Marcella's house was just what we wanted and as described in a great location.
2018-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Cara,"Incredibly designed apartment. Super stylish with all the amenities and more provided.
Angela was super quick to respond and very nice to deal with. Highly recommend"
2014-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Kenneth,"We have a good stay at Marcelle's house at Maroubra Beach. The house is equipped with almost everything except WiFi and cloth dryer. Marcelle is very helpful and got us a hairdryer when we requested one from her.

The only bad experience we had is from the dirty floor at the kitchen area. Just wear shoes inside the house if you don't want to have black ink on your barefoot. We informed Marcelle about the floor and she quickly cleaned it but still not perfect.

Location of the house is only a few minutes walk to the beach and only 15 minutes drive to Sydney city or airport provided there is no congestion.  

Overall, we are happy with the stay but it would be better if the house get cleaned regularly and hygiene level is improved. "
2018-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Anita,The location is superb. The service was great unfortunately the condition of the unit itself was disappointing and I felt sorry for the cleaners because they are obviously under pressure because of the high turnover.
2017-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Maria,"We loved the soft seat in front of the fabulous views of Sydney through huge windows. The rest of the apartment - bed, bath, kitchen etc were so comfortable. Hugo & Pamela provided great directions, communication and welcome. We'll be back!"
2016-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,1310308,Ian,Great communication by host and the place was as described in the listing.
2017-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,20578419,Ann,"A great place, comfy bed, decorated very nicely and was bigger than expected! Hosts were lovely, with prompt replies and were very accomodating. Would definitely recommend and stay again :-)"
2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,24848349,Abigail,"Great night away with my partner! Very welcoming and friendly hosts! They went out of their way for us and we really appreciated it. 10/10 from us. 
We will be back, thank you!"
2018-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,31002017,Sasha,"pros
-great communication and availability to talk, even during holidays
 -willingness to resolve issues 
-location
-competitive price
-newly renovated kitchen, living and bed
-Apartment rooms look like the pictures

cons
-cockroaches present. before booking, ask if this is still a problem. we left after one night instead of the original length of booking from this issue (but hosts were willing to resolve without any problems)
-no wifi, even though it was listed as having in inclusions 
-only has a fan, no air con. This apartment heats quickly in summer weather, so air con is quite necessary in my opinion
-run down apartment complex (old)
-hallway is outdoors (I.e. when exiting the apartment, the hallways leading from the elevators to rooms are outdoors on balcony)"
2018-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,23106836,James,"Enjoyed my stay again this week, thanks judy."

Lucy and Ralph lovely people,very warm welcome and very friendly. Happy to have found this place. 40 minutes from cbd,great getaway!would love to visit again"
2017-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,16964637,Hayley,"A nice simple room with a very comfy bed! Judy was great, very responsive to my messages although I didn't get to actually meet her in person."

2017-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,1143151,Lynne,"We had 3 nights at Eleanor's place and it was perfect. Location, communication, very warm welcome with a fabulous breakfast hamper.  The views from the windows and front balcony are stunning and the locality offers really handy restaurants, cafes, convenience stores. A 10/10 apartment/location.  Thanks so much Eleanor."
2015-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,8977830,Tom,Excellent location in the heart of Sydney. Great view private view of the harbour from the 34th floor. As 1st time visitors we had the prefect base for exploring the city. Detailed sign in instructions and Hugo was easy to reach ...though assistance was not needed as everything was as presented. Have no hesitation recommending as a good value. There is a Woolworths a block away to pick up any supplies.
2018-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,David,Michele is certainly a super host. The studio was more than what was described and superbly appointed! Lots of lovely little touches from the groovy red door to the lovely chest as a coffee table! The bathroom is beautiful and the shower fantastic. Great bed and super comfy couches. A really top place to stay and perfect for our needs on this trip to Sydney.
2018-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,5923031,Ed,"Really a perfect place to stay in terms of location, facilities, value and comfort.  Communication was very clear from start to finish.  Slept brilliantly every night and really appreciated the fact that Narelle gave some of her local recommendations for Newtown.  Proximity to the train station means that you can be in the centre of Sydney well within half an hour.   Strongly recommended!"
2017-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,19238057,Rebecca,"Room is wonderful , clean and tidy.

2019-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Valerie,Logement très beau et bien placé. David communique rapidement. Le quartier est calme et vraiment sympa . Nous reviendrons !
2017-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,12655535,Jane,"A lovely unit in a very convenient spot. Easy walk to Darling Harbour and walking bridge to city. Pyrmont ferry terminal close 10 minute walk - 5 stops to Circular Quay with great views of Harbour Bridge, Opera House and other sights as you travel. Coles 300 m away so easy to pick up groceries on way back from ferry. One stop to Balmain on ferry then catch 442 bus up to trendy shops and cafes. Catch 389 bus around corner into city or onto Bondi. Just be aware that all bathrooms in the building are being replaced so there may be some banging noise during the day depending on what level they are working on. Not overly loud at this stage. Clear, quick communication with those managing unit. Would recommend staying here."
2017-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Lesley,"Great flat - 2 decent sized bedrooms, nice living room and well equipped kitchen and really great location. Recommended!"

His place was really tidy, clean, spacious (it's more spacious than the photos) and in a really convenient location (minutes from central station). I would definitely recommend!"
2016-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Mara,Great place for a short stay in Sydney. The fashion room is very spacious and confortable and the neighbourhood is just perfect with great restaurants and local environment.
2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Craig,"Very impressive apartment, great location and don’t hesitate to book this one if you in the Homebush area or anywhere for that matter! Great views"

2018-10-14T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Natassja,"This apartment is in such a perfect location, everything is within walking distance. It is very cosy and has everything you should ever need. Truly like a home away from home. Chloe was great at replying to any questions we had and her staff member, Crystal was equally as helpful. It just made our first ever trip to Sydney that much more enjoyable."
2018-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Andy,"Lovely stay at a great property, nice area and host."

2017-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Zac,Great place. Exactly as advertised.
2014-08-02T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Linda,"Susan is great and a very attentive and friendly host and very informative on where things are locally and in Sydney if you don't know the area so well. I really enjoyed my stay at Bronte B&B studio. It is a lovely space in a garden setting, quiet and in a street where you can park easily and walk to the beach and restaurants. The studio is well set up with a comfy bed and everything you would need. The fridge was packed with nice things like strawberries and yogurt and it's easy to have a light meal/breakfast etc. There's also an outside paved area among the trees with table and chairs which makes it lovely.   Bronte is a great area and the cliff walk to Bondi is great. I would fully recommend this and so much better than staying in a hotel."
2017-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,8106459,Hannah,A beautiful apartment! Brenda was very accommodating with our arrival and departure times. This is a great spot for easy bus routes in to Sydney and a 15 min walk to Coogee Beach and Randwick.
2012-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,310414,Nicole,David's place was really beautiful and (Darlinghurst) is the perfect location from which to explore the rest of Sydney.  The bedroom has plenty of space to 'unpack' and the adjacent balcony is great when you want stop moving for a bit.  The shared kitchen and living space are very comfortable.
2017-08-16T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Chris,"Great location on the border of Sydney CBD and Surry Hills . Easy to get to via car and train. Kitted out to a good spec and comfortable.

Beware for the less mobile: steep internal staircases and low ceiling in attic room."
2018-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,19348489,Felix,"Great location. Both residential and touristy with many shops around. We could walk nearly everywhere and if we were tired the train and buses are right near the house. Make sure to have coffee at La Douce France right near the house. The studio is very comfortable, sunny and fully equipped."
2018-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,21637487,Monica,"El lugar está recientemente remodelado y es muy lindo y estiloso, cerca de todo, al frente de la playa, del transporte público y a dos cuadras del supermercado.
Tiene lavadora y proporcionan toallas, jabón, shampoo y acondicionador.
Lo mejor para esta época de verano es la jarra con agua helada esperandote en el refrigerador.
El dpto es muy iluminado aunque no tiene ventanas hacia la calle principal. 
Para los que lleven maletas hay que subir unas escaleras hacia el primer piso.
Se puede cocinar pero tener cuidado para que no suene la alarma de humo.
Tiene horno, hervidor, tostador todos nuevos.
Excelente lugar para unos días en Bondi.
Nos encantó.
Y Kasey preocupada de cómo estábamos siempre.

Gracias 
Monica"

2017-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,6046461,Amanda,"Suzie was absolutely wonderful in helping me get set up and make the most of my short time in Sydney. She was full of great recommendations and useful directions and was incredibly friendly. It's a great central location and a short walk to just about anywhere or an even quicker train ride away from everything. The apartment was extremely clean and Suzie has everything you might need available, including power adapters for international travelers. "
2015-08-08T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Andie,"I stayed with Natasa for around four months starting when I moved over from the UK in April. I was looking for somewhere chilled out to stay while I settled into my new job and Natasa's was perfect. Natasa is s great host, she is welcoming and friendly but at the same time gives you privacy. She knows so much about Sydney and will give lots of advice from anything from restaurants to transportation. I really enjoyed my time staying at Natasa's and definitely recommend for a great base for exploring Sydney."
2016-08-15T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Candace,"Definitely a great place to stay, such a beautiful apartment. Thank you so much for ur kindly host Nicole :)"
2017-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Rich,Well equipped and excellent location. The host was a pleasure to deal with from the outset.
2019-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,17915093,Arika,Very quite area but close to public transport and easy to get beach also the city.  Allen response very quick and organized very well. I recommended this place!
2018-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,15650737,Sam,"Both Sarah and her place was absolutely brilliant. The accommodation was spotless, peaceful and everything written in the listing was there. Sarah herself was such a warm, generous and welcoming host, she responded very quickly and was always on hand if I need anything. Would definitely recommend it the place!"

2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,13674956,Christopher,"The studio was great for us to stay. We love to stay in North Sydney and had the best stay in Millies studio with amazing bridge views. The studio is how it‘s described by Millie, for my wife and myself perfect to relax for a week. It‘s not to small as you will stay in it just for the night and in case of staying there for a longer time you can use the balcony with his amazing views.

We used the Milsons Point train station, but more often the ferry terminals North Sydney and Milsons Point because of the short ways to Circular Quay and city. Shopping is possible in North Sydney supermarkets which are 10 minutes away.

Millie answers very fast and is helpful in everything although there is (nearly) nothing that needs to be explained because of all the information Millie gives to you.

Would definitively love it to stay again in Millies studio!

Thank you again,
cheers Chris"

2019-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Joseph,"We spent 10 days in this lovely space while at at Mardi Gras and could not have been happier.  Very short walk to hop on train, amazing neighborhood with great cafes, Saturday market in the park across the street on weekends.  12 minute walk to Oxford Street.  Loved it!"
2017-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,21127680,Gayatri,"The location was amazing and Coffee was very welcoming, but the food stench in the entire place was awful. Otherwise, I'd totally recommend this place!"

Arrangements were made in case I arrived when she wasn't home but in the end they weren't need. 

Natasha was very welcoming and the house was well presented. Them room was also very nice."
2018-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Carol,"This is a great location! Close to the cruise docks, ferry and the train. We walked to the opera house and had fun exploring the area. Took the train to other places as our main transportation, including to the airport at the end of our stay. The appartment has lots of room and fully stocked kithcen. The bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of towels. A washer and dryer was a bonus. Great place and location for the price!"
2018-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,15745971,Gareth,"Great space, good size, nice and clean, quiet, good location, air con (needed during summer months)."

2017-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Ruth,"I travelled from Brisbane to Sydney for a function in Manly and the location of Paul's place was fantastic. I was able to easily manage my luggage from the Manly ferry to the accommodation. Clean, neat, and all that was required."
2017-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Alicia,"Loved this place! For all it's character, space, location. Everything we wanted was close by and easily accessed by foot or public transport right at the door. Such a groovy space. Looks like a great team that run it, they were all so easy to communicate with."

2019-01-30T05:00:00.000Z,30412858,Paul,"As you enter this comfortable apartment, it gives you a hearty welcome as you discover the many wonders of Sydney. Other add on's of this visit include a gym if you need a work-out and a wonderful pool that proves a fundamental as part of the torrid atmosphere of the city. The bedrooms are absolutely stunning! All the sheets are clean and the room itself is magnificently spotless. It is located at a perfect spot, with the closeness of the best 5 star hotel! A clear cut stay that's worthwhile!"
2017-05-19T04:00:00.000Z,4589874,Avrîl,Beautiful modern clean house with friendly helpful hosts. Location could not be more central in Bondi. Had an amazing stay - highly recommend.
2016-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Camille,"Great flat, close to public transportation. Hernan was very nice and let us drop our bags off before chek-in. Would recommend a 100%"

2016-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Winnie,"We couldn't have asked for more.  :)  Great host, location, and oh so comfortable!"
2016-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,David,"Shuang's place is a really good distance from the airport, thus making it a convenient location to stay for that reason. The space was clean, and the bathroom was modern and large. Not much else to do around there, but if you're staying for the airport it's great. "
2015-01-31T05:00:00.000Z,4502957,Andrew,"It would be difficult to overestimate how fantastic Hannah was as a host. We arrived in Sydney having been let down only 24 hours before arriving when our previous host gave us a late cancellation. We needed a property that could accommodate five children and Hannah came up trumps.
Hannah remained in constant contact with us throughout that stressful arrival day and offered us her house for the week. She was an absolute lifesaver and rescued our holiday. (For the record, Lisa Peterson of L'Abode Accommodation let us down with the cancellation and never inquired about our welfare throughout our stay in Sydney !)
Onto the house, it was beautiful, well equipped and a perfect location. Hannah and her family greeted us on our arrival and made us feel at home. We did not need anything extra and had a fantastic stay. We exchanged a couple of mails with Hannah during the week and knowing she was available was great.
The shops are close - supermarkets / restaurants and it was quick and easy access to the City. Great spot.
As I previously said, Hannah went out of her way to assist us and we are so grateful. Her house is perfect and if we are in Sydney again, I wouldn't hesitate to call Hannah again. 10 / 10......

Lisa Peterson of L'Abode accommodation was just appalling. Just imagine arriving in a city 12,000 miles from home (Sydney from London) with a wife and five kids and having no accommodation, with it being cancelled just six hours before you got on the plane, but email and with no personalized apology. Then magnify that issue with a host that just didn't (and obviously still doesn't care). This has really affected my view of Airbnb and I am not an advocate of the process, especially as I appear to be unable to warm other travellers about L'Abode Accommodation. I suppose Trip Adviser might assist but Airbnb should consider this for future."
2018-03-04T05:00:00.000Z,1714235,Kerry-Anne,This house is only 50 minutes from Sydney CBD and a 10 minute ferry/water taxi ride. It is literally on the beach and most rooms have fantastic views across the water. It is very relaxing and accommodating with everything you might need - just byo food and drink. After 3 days it felt like we had been away for a week. We would definitely come back again.
2018-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,15745971,Junhua,"The landlord is very good, and then the house is very, very complete, and very clean. Well, we had a very nice few days' holiday here, and the landlord communicated with each other very promptly and had a very friendly reception. I would like to recommend it to others."
2016-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,10213499,Michael,"This is a fantastic situation. Located right across the street from the lake. Tracy offered us bicycles to use on the lake path. The apartment has everything you need and is very spacious. Short drive to the ocean beach for surfing and swimming. Kitchen well equipped. 
Tracy was very informative and engaging. 
We really enjoyed our stay!

2018-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,20578419,Amy,"My family and I stayed in this apartment over the weekend. It was the first time I had booked with Airbnb - communication and assistance from our hosts was fantastic throughout the booking process and our stay. The apartment was clean and tidy. You really can’t beat the location - close to central station, only a block from secure parking and a short walk to Darling Harbour."
2018-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,24863216,Stacey,"Vivian's place is lovely :) The apartment is stylish and really beautifully appointed. Everything is new and shiny!

It was a really great experience staying at Vivian's place, I thoroughly recommend it to others!"

2017-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,12256344,Vera,"Paul & Judith were wonderful hosts - we enjoyed staying with them in their beautiful home! We also loved the small conversations with them - they were so nice & open to answer all our questions : ) But they also respected our privacy. The location is perfect - so close to many good restaurants, bars & cafés. Highly recommended!"
2018-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Jane,"Can't say enough good things about this place. It's in one of the most beautiful spots in Sydney, with a gorgeous, sheltered North-east aspect looking over Barrenjoey Island. The house makes the most of the space - with beautiful and ample outdoor spaces to enjoy the view, and a gorgeously landscaped garden. It's even nicer than the photos if that's possible.

The house is full of character and very stylishly appointed, yet relaxed and beachy enough so you feel at ease - and OK with kids!

The treehouse bedroom is spectacular and we loved how it was decorated :-)

Richard and Claudia have thought of everything - there's filtered tap water, coffee pods, and even a rice cooker which we used. 

We absolutely loved the fire pit - we were staying in July and were surprised at how much heat it gave as we sat around it watching the moon rise and the stars come out.

Mackeral Beach itself is stunning - so nice to have peace from cars, and go for a bush walk on Sunday to Resolute Beach. The ferry was an easy way to travel, as was the water taxi.

A wallaby came to visit us on the first night which was lovely. 

Richard was so nice and helpful to deal with via email and texts. 

Basically, we all want to move here! Falling short of that, we'll definitely be back for a holiday. 

"
2014-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Dominic,"We were warmly greeted by the owner Gregory, who showed us the studio and provided useful information like where to eat, distances to regions etc. The studio was immaculate – very clean & stylishly decked out. The studio includes thoughtful touches such as: maps and travels guides of Sydney, wifi, iPod/iPhone sound system adapter, beach towels, soaps, shampoo/conditioner, hair dryer, iron. The kitchenette was complete with amenities and complimentary food: oats, yoghurt, orange juice, fruit, milk, coffee. The studio is in a gorgeous garden setting. Its quiet and located just 5 min walk from the beach and 3 min walk from the delicious Three Blue Ducks. We would definitely recommend booking Bronte B & B Studio."
2018-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,18315277,Richard,"Great location for a 8-10 min stroll to the beach, plenty of cafes and shops much closer. Spacious place with great master bedroom, but small and uncomfortable (double) sofa bed in lounge - may be better to book a proper 2 bed place if you need two proper beds."
2016-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,5511614,Brian,"Stayed in Leanne's Queenscliff apartment for 3 weeks during a 5 week work stay in Sydney. Apartment was absolutely first class, great location so close to Manly and surrounding beaches. Leanne was a fantastic host, meeting me on check in and showing me around. Couldn't fault anything about the apartment, lovely neighbours, secure parking. I would 100% recommend Leanne's apartment to anyone looking to enjoy Manly and the surrounding area. As a hostess, Leanne epitomised the Airbnb values. "
2018-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Katie,"This was a lovely, charming place to stay. I absolutely loved it. The place was very clean and comfortable and I immediately felt at home. The bed was very comfortable, and there was an electric blanket underneath the linens so the bed was nice and warm (I was here in the winter so this was REALLY nice to have). There was also a little space heater, so it was very comfortable. There was a lovely breakfast set-up with cereal, tea and coffee, and a water boiler. There were fresh flowers on the table and Cathy had written a nice welcoming note. Cathy also drove me to one of my events (I was here for a wedding) when Uber didn't work. It was a lovely stay and I will definitely stay here again if I return!"

He was very responsive and it is obvious that a lot of thought and care has been put into making the apartment feel airy and liveable. The location could not be more central and we had two excellent dinners at some of the many restaurants in easy walking distance. Thanks again, Paul."
2018-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Yasuhiro,I stayed Hugo's place for five weeks. Few minutes to Kings Cross Station or takes only about 20min to CBD. Great place for exploring Sydney. There is almost everything you need in the room. Public washing machine is located in down stairs you will need three one dollar coins to use washing machine. Unfortunately I could not use internet for 4weeks due to failure but Hugo gave me a refund for recharge my data-usage for hotspot.

We arrived at Sydney late night of Christmas eve so couldn't go for buying food or something. So Linda did shopping for us! We could have enjoyed great christmas dinner thanks for Linda ;) and House located near downtown, so we could walk to Darling Habour very easily. There was some trouble though. There was a black out for an hour, and we could'nt use Wifi. Linda was very sorry for those problem, so she give us USB for internet. She said she was waiting for Wifi installation and it will be available soon. I will stay at Linda's if I go Sydney again! ;)"
2018-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,4919014,Neil,Top hosts. Great apartment in a brilliant location. Really well set up and sparkling clean. Strongly recommended.
2016-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,9759372,Rafael,"Allisons and co were awesome. The place was perfect for me. I just needed a couple of nights in Newtown with some similar aged people. Was a very relaxed and independent vibe. One of housemates was very nice and even invited me out with her friends. I felt very welcomed although with a good dose of space and privacy. Perfect 5/5. Oh and it was my first air bnb stay :) 
Thanks Allison and co!"

It suited our requirements including easy parking and close to major facilities.
I highly recommend this property and will be back "
2018-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Chloe,Great little apartment in Sydney. Super close to Kings Cross area for restaurants and bars. As well as several local cafes around. Not a bad walk into the actual city city (20-25mins depending on pace/destination and route). Communication was really good and we were able to leave our bags until our flight (obviously subject to booking demands). Convenient transport links nearby as well. Makes for a very good base to explore Sydney!
2018-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Rodney,"The property in hombush needs some considerable work done. An review as previously mentioned by other visitors including repairing if the lounge, removal of stains and unblocking of the shower drain need to occur. Also access on the weekend was difficult with nil entry to the main reception to “find” the key as there was no door man present.  Thinking these are isolated events might entice others to believe this should be fixed however we have experienced the same issues as another guest from 2 months ago. Communication was limited and only began after direct contact with air b&b. On a slighty better note the city view was beautiful which I got to enjoy all night as a fault battery in the cupboard alarmed every 30min."
2017-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,14921505,Jana,Bailey has been an absolutely perfect host - he has gone out of his way by providing everything you would need to stay here. The house is amazing and the views and location are spectacular. It is all of the little things that made our holiday feel just like home. I would highly recommend staying here with families and friends.
2016-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Shannon,"Cat wasn't there to meet us but we had a fantastic time! The house was a comfortable distance from the hustle and bustle of the centre of Bondi, and only a short walk away from the sea side. Cat's Neighbours were also really friendly and hospitable. Ready to offer us assistance whenever. The heating in the house was great during winter and the wifi was fantastic! The check in process was quick. The kitchen and pantry were really well stocked and the houses was prepped to perfection with small thoughtful things like an international plug adaptor that we had forgotten to bring. Thanks Cat for the lovely stay!! "

Location is very good, close to the public transport, just a few minutes walk to the Kings Cross station. There are lots of bars, restaurants, supermarket in the neighborhood.
Jenny and Simon are a very nice and helpful. Check in was quick and nice, despite it was a late evening. Summarizing - everything was perfect. We hope to be back to Sydney and this lovely place.

2015-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,6785160,Marita,"Wir haben uns sehr wohl und willkommen gefühlt! Die Beschreibungen von der Unterkunft und dem Umfeld haben definitiv nicht zu viel versprochen. In 20 min. ist man bequem in der Innenstadt mit dem öffentlichen Nahverkehr, fußläufig gibt es mehrere Cafes und die Gastgeber sind sehr freundlich, aufgeschlossen und stets mit einem guten Tipp zur Stelle. Wir würden definitiv gerne wieder kommen, sollte es uns erneut nach Sydney verschlagen. Absolut empfehlenswert!

The bed is VERY SOFT - very very soft and the place is desperate for some basic upgrades - wouldn't take muchto make it significantly better.  "
2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,19641701,Jo,"We really enjoyed our stay at Laura's apartment. It was clean, cosy and had an amazing view of the city. We made good use of the local ferry, which was only  a short walk from the apartment. Laura was a helpful and friendly host. "

The apartment is old but pleasant. Sleeping was very hot and uncomfortable

2017-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,18315277,Rob,"Nice place in a great location.

This is a flat in a great location. Minutes only from the beach, public transport and of course, the cafes of Bondi Beach. The flat is well laid out and well suits someone staying in the local area. 

Sarah was a great host. We had a few initial issues but she was very efficient and courteous in resolving them. Her directions to get to the flat and the keys was terrific and worked like a dream. 

Well worth considering for your stay in Bondi"

2015-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Amanda,"We had a lovely stay at MissD's home. It is very close (3 minute walk) to King Street for eats and drinks, as well as Enmore Theatre which was where we went for the evening. The home was clean, the bed and pillows were very comfortable, the towels were fluffy, and there are two clean and bright bathrooms. We will stay there again."

2017-08-28T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Dominick,I come to Sydney 4 times a year and this is always my #1 destination. But it's so popular that it's always booked out 6 to 9 months in advance for long term stays! Highly recommended!
2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,21612973,Lukas,I loved my second stay at Jackie and Martin's place. They're such kind people and the place is simply amazingly comfortable :)
2017-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,15889399,Jessica,"I loved my time at Steven's place. Close to everything, neat, clean with little touches of luxury (can't compete with a waterfall shower head) - this is the AirBnB pick for you if you're searching for a slice of home in the big city. Steven is extremely welcoming and friendly, and if you're not familiar with the area, he'll soon fill your head with all sorts of inside tips and places to eat. Don't miss out on this Petersham paradise.

What I loved: 
*The freedom to come and go as I pleased with ease via the side gate.
*The bed was super comfortable. 
The villa is an ideal space for writers, professionals or anyone looking to get away on their own. Works for couples too. 
*The proximity to some of my old-school favourites, including Daisy's Milkbar."

The  apartment is super-stylish, quiet, relaxing and really well appointed with all the bits and pieces required to make it feel like a home from home (a superb bed AND fast wifi). The ""welcome pack"" of fruit, bread, milk and eggs with tea and coffee (Nespresso - thank you Louise!) were more than welcome for a couple of weary travellers. The apartment's location is perfect - smack-bang in the middle of Woollahra village with it's lovely shops, pubs and coffee places and a hop, skip and a jump into the CBD. It is perfectly located if you are planning to spend some time in the Eastern suburbs of Sydney.  To top it all off, Louise was very responsive and really helpful. Thanks a lot Louise, if you'll have us, we will be back the next time we are in Sydney."

2015-08-07T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Joanna,"My cousin and I stayed here for a couple nights in August 2015. It's a crazy short walk from Central Station, which makes it easy to get just about anywhere in the city and really handy if you're getting the train from the airport because the airport link stops at Central. The place was exactly as it looks in the photos: clean, spacious and filled with light. Nicole was lovely to deal with from start to finish and I said to my cousin that I'll definitely look this place up again next time I need a place in Sydney!"
2015-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Helene,"The Bronte B&B Studio is a little gem in a beautiful seaside neighbourhood, and yet with good transportation links to the CBD.  The accommodation is exactly as pictured, and is very peaceful, being in the garden of Susan and her husband's lovely home.  Our hosts were extremely welcoming and helpful, telling us about local restos, public transit into the city, and calling taxis when we needed a faster mode of transportation.  The breakfast provisions provided were generous and healthful, and we appreciated Susan remembering that we are vegetarians.  If you want a relaxing stay in Sydney, near a beach, the Bronte B&B Studio is the ticket, and Susan and her husband are great hosts.  Highly recommended."

It looks awesome, like in the pictures and you are welcome to use all the facilities, including the outside entertainment area with bbq and pool! Austin is a very polite and caring host. He wants everyone to enjoy their stay and answers all questions immediately. Canterbury train station is just a short walk away, as is Woolworths and Aldi. We would definitely stay here again.

The house has great charm about it and I loved how the neighborhood  is so neat and quite, yet so close to shops, restaurants, cafes, and public transportation for city access. I had access to buses within a few min walk. The room was great, private and comfortable. The dogies are very nice and kind if you like dogs. Overall, amazing stay, would love to come back for sure."

Her place is stunning and super clean with great amenities! Overall we had an amazing time at her appartment, which was also a short walk from Bondi Beach and really nice restaurants!

Thank you Marcela for your Hospitality!"
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Courtney,"Fantastic, central location in Darlinghurst and within walking distance to lots of sights. As mentioned by previous reviews, the stairs are very steep but for people without mobility issues it should be no problem. Comfortable beds, stylish fit-out, inventive use of natural light and well-equipped for our long weekend in Sydney. No doors on two of the en suites was not hugely ideal for family/friend stay but we made it work perfectly fine and for couples it likely wouldn't have been an issue. Friendly hosts and easy check-in. Would highly recommend."
2016-06-10T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Jon,Great place and awesome location next to some great food. Cat was easy going and flexible on arrival and check out.

The studio was fully equipped and beautifully styled. Our privacy was respected. We will definitely be staying again on our next Sydney visit. Thank you Cath "

2013-11-04T05:00:00.000Z,1073607,Sandy,"Natasa is a very amazing and lovely host. She was very warmful and helpful, always up for giving advice or to chat. The house is very well located : close to Petersham station so very easy to go to the center (but without any noise from the room). The room is spacious and nice!  And the kitchen (we enjoyed the terrace ;-)  and the bathroom are very well furnished and you have enough space to put all your personal stuff. 
We had a very great stay so thank you again Natasa !!!

The fact that this apartment is on the first floor made air movement and noise in the evenings a little bit of an issue, but for the value that is just something to consider.

Overall this was a good experience!"
2018-10-29T04:00:00.000Z,15312988,Mareike,"Cindy is a really kind host and I loved to stay at her place. The room is cozy and perfect for one person.

El vecindario es de lo mejor, es muy relajado y seguro. Tienes parada de autobús muy cercana y puedes llegar caminando a tiendas y restaurantes, el barrio vale mucho la pena recorrerlo.
Casey y Larry fueron excelentes anfitriones.
El cuarto en muy amplio y cuentas con un baño al lado que solo es para esa habitación. En la habitación podías prepararte café o té, está muy iluminada y es bastante amplia.
Hay que subir muchas escaleras y te lo avisan con antelación, para nosotros estuvo muy bien.
Lindos detalles en la habitación y el baño, realmente teníamos todo lo necesario.
Pudimos lavar algo de ropa y eso fue muy bueno para nosotros.
Es un hermoso hogar  que Casey y Larry compartieron con nosotros."

We definitely recommend this host and place."
2015-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Joan Frances Lenny,"Miss D was very responsive and helpful. I was amazed at how prompt she responded to all my queries. She also went an extra mile to always ensure that I was fully satisfied with the answers provided. I remember asking for a last minute change on the room setup as I had an extra friend joining us in the trip and she tried her best to accommodate my friend so we could all stay together. 

When I requested Miss D for an earlier check in, she also accommodated to my request. She even messaged me to ensure that I had no problem in checking in to the house. Throughout our short stay in Miss D's, she always ensured that we were comfortable and had all the necessities available and ready. Miss D was very friendly and exceptionally accommodating to her guests' request and feedback. 

I and my friend really liked the place! It was clean, organised, and very cosy. The room that we stayed in was also spacious even when there were 4 of us. The bathroom was clean. The house was very organised. I and my friend were so impressed that Miss D labelled everything so properly in the kitchen and put notes around the house which were helpful for visiting guests, who came from outside Sydney.

This was my first airbnb stay and I could not stop advocating this place to all my other friends :) I would without any hesitance come back again if I am to visit Sydney in the future. Thank you so much for making our stay a pleasant one. I am looking forward to visiting again in the future.

Cheers! :) "

Incredibly handy to Darling Harbour and an easy walk tot he train station for travelling further a field. The pool was a welcome relief from the heat after long days exploring / shopping around Sydney. 
The space itself is much larger than other 1 bedroom apartments I have stayed in and was very comfortable. I would recommend this apartment to others heading to Sydney. I couldnt fault it! "
2018-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Trevor,"Evelyn's place was stunning. Very thoughtful touches in the rooms, including a bottle of wine to enjoy! Avalon had incredible food and coffee, and palm beach was a great place to explore. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to Avalon, but well worth the walk. Transit is also very easy to get to/from the home, including trips to Palm beach and Sydney. My girlfriend and I had thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would definitely come back!"

The place is well designed, very bright and large. 
I would go back anytime!"

2018-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,3042637,Judy,"Wonderful studio in a secluded spot at the rear of a beautiful garden. We had a private outdoor table. Delicious breakfast with yummy muesli and fresh fruit. Lovely soft towels and even beach towels were included. 

The studio is a short 8-10 minute walk to Bronte beach and the coastal walks to either Bondi or Coogee.

Cafes and restaurants are only a few minutes walk away.

Our hosts are friendly with a wonderful welcoming. Highly recommend this as a place to stay. We look forward to returning."

The coffee machine was an awesome touch and we felt very welcomed the entire time. Looking forward to staying again!"
2016-06-05T04:00:00.000Z,888107,Wendy,It was a short enjoyable trip thanks to Wyatt. Thank you for his hospitality and warmth welcome to his home. Wyatt is very easy-going and comfortable to get along with. We shared and exchanged quite a bit of interest in common and thanks to Airbnb I have made a new friend :)
2016-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,12256344,Jackie,"We spent 10 days at Paul's and Judith's house and felt welcomed from the very first moment. The house is very nice and in a great location. There're many restaurants around and a bus stop just by the corner. The room and bathroom are  spacious, clean and nicely decorated.
Paul and Judith, as well as the rest of the family, were very nice, friendly and interesting to talk to. They also gave us many tips about things to do and places to visit in Sydney. We shared many good times with them and we would definitely book this room again.
Highly recommended!

2017-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Tina,"Great location! 5 min walk to Circular Quay and the Sydney Opera House. We were able to walk and take public transportation to all the sights. 

The studio was spacious for our family of 3. The bathroom is a bit small but it worked. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows and towels. "
2018-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,16408272,Ed,A nice CBD location close to the business district for business travellers. Nice location with lots of local places to dine.

2018-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,1979960,David,A beautiful house in a great location! Furniture was very basic though. Could also use air-conditioning to help with the heat - although there are small fans everywhere.
2016-07-02T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Suzy,"Overall, this was a great space for our quick three night stay in Sydney.  The location was terrific for getting around the city either by train or on foot and the binder left by Paul gave some great suggestions of nearby places.  There were a few finer details missing that would have made the place feel more homey, but it was a terrific base to see Sydney from.  Thanks!!"
2017-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Sheree,"Absoutely loved it ... 
loved it that much I'm booking it again. 
So close to everything and a beautiful home to nestle in and be away from the hustle and bustle .. 
I honestly didn't need to use my car at all cause everything is so close. 
And anything I wasn't sure about they helped me with right away. 
And make sure you check out the gorgeous coffee shop on the corner . 
Yummiest Italian food and nicest guys who own it . "
2017-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,19641701,Martin,"We enjoyed our stay at Laura's place a lot. The ferry terminal to the city is just a few steps away, and the view is just overwhelming. It's a quiet and pretty neighborhood and shops, cafes, and restaurants are not too far away. The apartment is quite spacious and the kitchen has everything we needed. The instructions on where to find the key were a bit unclear to us at first, but in the end everything worked out well."
2017-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,9802077,David,Helena’s place was ideal for my visit. Situated not far from the trendy neighbourhood and many eateries. The place also has balcony and great city scape views.

2015-10-16T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Glesni,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Simone's beautiful house. Very spacious, with everything you could possibly need.

2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,16651655,Ella,"Steven was considerate! 
Bungalow is described accurately. 
Steven had female toiletries which is often over-looked and was nice to see. Place appeared nice and clean, had all the kitchen utilities I needed. Even brought me over some milk for a cup of tea!  Mosquitoes were apparently a bit of an issue, but I didn’t even notice as Steven had gone to measures to try and stop it from being a problem with sprays, creams ect. Had Everything for it and I wasn’t annoyed by one once. 
Just make sure you read about the smoking policy if you’re a smoker, as You must smoke on the street, off the property.  Was great for my quick stay. Thank you!"

2018-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,22295401,Lucy,"We stayed at Griffin's space in Kings Cross/ Potts Point for a week and enjoyed it - the flat was bigger than I was expecting and being high up got beautiful light which we loved. It really had everything we needed. Griffin was very quick to respond to my messages and checked up on us mid week to make sure everything was fine which we appreciated. The location is fantastic being a couple of minutes to Kings Cross station and all the amenities the area has. The only thing I would mention is that being so central it can get a bit noisy in the flat, especially as the slatted window in the kitchen doesn't close as far as we could see and there was an air conditioning unit or something on the other side of it. But with ear plugs this didn't bother us too much and all the other excellent points more than made up for it. Thanks Griffin! Lucy and Ben"
2018-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Michelle,Great place to stay - amazing location! :)

Only 10 minute walk to Queenscliffe beach so ideal for someone looking to enjoy Manly and it's beach without being in the middle of everything."

2019-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Georgina,"A charming flat in an amazing location in Manly.
Had everything we needed for our stay, travelling with 2 children aged 7 and 3.
A great space to base ourselves for a few days, with access to several beaches within a very short walk which was ideal and close to shops and restaurants. Yet still in a quiet street so no nighttime disturbances.
Would love to stay again when next visiting Oz.
Thanks Paul for being a great host."

2014-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Sonya,"My partner and I had the best stay at the Garden Studio, and hope to stay again one day. The space was beautifully and thoughtfully designed, and had everything we needed. We loved the generous breakfast spread and enjoyed fresh eggs and homemade bread both mornings, and slept so well in the loft bed. We had our car, and found Marrickville a really easy place to stay, it was very central to everywhere we needed to go (city, Surry Hills, Alexandria), and parking was easy.

Cath had also baked me the most beautiful white chocolate mud cake because she knew my birthday was coming up, and we arrived back to the studio one night to find a box of meringues waiting for us. I'd highly recommend the studio :)"
2015-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,1979960,Joseph,"Beautiful, enormous town house in a perfect location.  Within easy walking distance of the train station at  Kings Cross, the bars, restaurants and clubs on Oxford Street and even the centre of the city.  Stunning views of the city from the balcony outside the uppermost, Swiss-chalet style bedroom.  We had four adult males staying in the house and we all had plenty of space.  For a group of people, it's also very economical: much cheaper than trying to find a similar hotel suite for the same price.  Perfect for a short or extended stay in Sydney, and surprisingly tranquil for such a central location.  Small tip: if there are two or more of you, it's just as cheap to get a taxi from the airport than taking the train. Jeremy is also very friendly and helpful."

2015-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Glenn,"My first trip to Sydney plus first Bnb experience were perfect thanks to Naveen and her husband Tris.  The neighborhood  was a great one where everything were so close and convenient, I actually had a number of my meals nearby and they were all very good.  The train was just 5 minutes away and we could get to almost anywhere within 40 minutes.   
Naveen and Tris are a cute couple, they were super helpful, I think I must have messaged Naveen 30 times throughout the trip asking questions from places to eat, to places to shop and visit.  They knew almost all the answers to my inquiries and on the rare occasions they would find it out for me in no time.  The main problem was not having enough time and appetite to visit all the great restaurants they recommended. 
As for the apartment, it is exactly what it looks like in the pictures, (which for me was the main reason I chose their place,) living in tiny apartments in Hong Kong, I find the place very spacious and all the necessary amenities were their for you on your arrival.  Their little pet Felix was also very friendly and is a great companion when the couple is out for work.
All in all, my first bnb experience was perfect and thanks to the couple, airbnb has a new loyal customer. "

2018-09-18T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Chelsea,Great location in Sydney. About a five minute walk from the harbour. It’s a small studio great for one or two people. There is a washer/dryer that I found super helpful since I ran the half marathon while I was visiting. It’s a good spot to stay a couple days in the city.
2017-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Stefanie,Shuang's place is beautiful! The room and bathroom are a substantial size and extremely clean. The comforter is SO comfortable! Shuang was also very prompt with providing directions and instructions immediately after booking and responded quickly thereafter. The Arncliffe train station is only a 10 minute walk and his place is conveniently located minutes from the airport. We stayed here due to an early  flight in the morning. This is a shared space with another Airbnb guest. Both rooms have private access and the door locks for extra security which gave us piece of mind. Overall great stay and highly recommended!
2018-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Joseph,"We had a great stay with Vickie. Check in was easy and she was very contactable and helpful throughout.  Tea and coffee making facilities appreciated.

Fold down bed was very comfy and made the most of the space within the room.  Also very stylishly decorates and (Hidden by Airbnb) TV was a great addition for watching Netflix.

Location was great, only a short walk to Kings cross station and loads of cool cafes close by.  Also worth noting is a shuttle to airport run by the hotel for only 14 dollars !!

We would happily stay there again."
2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,1979960,Sharon,"Jeremy was a breeze to deal with during a challenging time for our family. We had a family member in St Vincent's hospital at very short notice and Jeremy's place is a few minute walk away. Restaurants, shops and the city are so close. Parking was wonderful and the location was safe and quiet. We were needy guests due to circumstance and Jeremy was very patience and kind and nothing was a problem. Thank you!"
2017-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,10213499,Katrina,"Great bed, excellent cooking facilities, quiet, close to all amenities and transport, everything you need and then add a sociable dog, (if you like to take one for a walk) a lake, beach and the occasional chat and you have Tracy's place! A perfect spot for two"
2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Shili,"The studio was very clean and welcoming, location was perfect as well. Vickie was very friendly, she came to greet us and show us the studio. Not suitable for cooking since the smell will stay in the studio, so we ate mostly around the neighbourhood which was perfectly fine with us since there are so many food options."
2017-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Florian,"Nice and clean apartment, tastefully furnished in a very lively and interesting neighbourhood, and easy to reach with public transportation. Paul was an excellent and helpful host - very quick with communication when we needed it. Due to a delayed flight we had to check-in 15 hours later than planned, and Paul still made it possible, that was a real life saver - thank you, Paul! The bedroom window is not too far away from the street, so guests should not be too sensitive about acoustics from traffic driving by - but no problem with the crowd from Kings Cross which keeps a block away around the corner."
2018-11-08T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Elaina,"Really loved our stay at Kath's place. Convenient location as most trains go past Redfern, and only a one or two stations away from all the CBD goodness. The house is clean and tidy and her dog Ruski is just the sweetest!! The only thing I will say is if you're a light sleeper such as myself, it can be a bit noisy with the surroundings streets. However if thats not an issue for you then I highly recommend! :)"

2016-10-23T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Kevin,"David's light and airy flat is situated just at the sweet spot on Macleay St between the grit and eclectic vibe of Kings Cross and the genteel delights of Potts Point. With the fountain across the street providing a constant bubbling soundtrack we spent a very enjoyable five nights with immediate Darlinghurst at our doorstep and, via KX station two minute walk out the door, greater Sydney. Our third person in our party wanted to report that the futon was one of the most comfortable she has ever slept on. David was helpful before arrival and met us on the door to walk us through the locking systems, easily mastered, of the semi-public courtyard setup of the building. Flat was comfortably and stylishly furnished and we were not lacking for any amenity. Very much recommended. Oh, he was flexible on our departure time as he had a late next arrival so this made our leaving that bit easier. Thx David."

2017-09-02T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,Liam,"A great setup for families. Walking distance to the beach, a pool and a secure gated yard for the kids to play in.

On arrival, the apartment was quite grubby and full of host's personal possessions with only 2 drawers left for the two of us over a fortnight. The fridge had half empty jars, food stains were all over the cabinet doors, and the place was dusty.
We had a disaster in that we accidentally left the keys in the apartment (that locks behind you!). We were unable to contact Ben for over 2 days as he had left the country without informing us - ending with us out on the street for hours, having to stay in a hostel overnight and eventually paying for a locksmith as we desperately needed our belongings. Ben was not even remotely apologetic once he finally got in contact with us. 
Once we asked him if it was possible for him to reimburse for the locksmith and other costs, he replied aggressively with snarky and unnecessarily nasty comments about our stay - saying we had left wet towels on the floor when actually we had left one wet towel in the laundry basket that we had used to clean the water from the leaking toilet that was a great inconvenience throughout our stay and has been a complaint from another guest. Also said we raked through his personal belongings which were against his 'rules', when actually we only used a couple of towels from a drawer since he only left us one bath towel for two people for a fortnight. Ben has also attempted to charge us 100AUD regarding a small stain on the bed sheet, which is a completely ridiculous price especially considering the fee that we paid for cleaning.
Furthermore, we asked where he would like his new keys to be left so he could get back in his apartment - to which eventually he said to 'leave them on the kitchen table'. This obviously doesn't make any sense and he only replied a few hours before our departure so we replied we would leave one of the keys in an envelope in his letterbox under his other mail. Only after we requested reimbursement days after we had left, he replied in a hostile manner that he had to pay for his own locksmith as we didn't leave him his key(?). 
Overall a dreadful experience that we wouldn't like anyone else to go through, as leaving the keys in an apartment when the door locks behind your back could essentially happen to anyone. This could have been handled far more efficiently & pleasantly if the host had actually been a decent person so BEWARE."
2018-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,5549057,Olivier,"Brendan is a wonderful host. He will give you useful information. His flat is located from a 5-min walk from Bondi beach. But careful, the walk is steep when you come back from the beach ;) The coastal walk is very nice and a lot young people are gathering during summer time"

2017-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Deborah,"The location of this apartment is sensational. You can just sit at the breakfast bar and look into the passing parade of characters walking by the gorgeous El Alamein fountain. The apartment was like something out of a magazine: bright, white, and stylish. The bed was very comfortable, and there is an abundance of natural light through the leafy outlook."

2016-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Meegan,We really enjoyed our stay in Manly. Great location with plenty of coffee shops and resturants just down stairs and even markets on the weekend! Also close to the beach and wharf. Accommodation was just as described and pictured. Full working kitchen was a bonus. Ziggy was easy to deal with and even arranged early checkin. We would definitely choose to stay again.

Perfect for a quick weekend away- exactly what we needed. They were very accommodating and have put effort into lovely little touches for their guests which make it that little bit more special. We will be back!! "
2019-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,8559496,Steve,Always a great place to stay when in Sydney - so easy to get around with the train at your footstep. Tiger is a great host and very quick and helpful to make sure your check in is smooth.

Private guest suite with well equipped kitchen and separate entrance.  Excellent bed and large pleasant bedroom.  The food Anne supplied made for a generous breakfast and lovely home baked treats were very welcoming.  Thank you for offering a great place to stay."

It was clean and comfortable with little touches like Netflix and Wifi. Sara's was a great communicator.. thanks so much 5 out of 5! Will def stay again next time in Sydney."
2015-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Hui Min,"The house is quite easy to find and very near to the train station. Out of the house and after turning left, straight up and following the road out to the main road, turn left and walk straight for about 2 mins and you'll be at Newtown train station. 

There were 3 of us, and lucky for us we booked the room on the lower level (it'll be tough for us to carry our luggages up and down the stairs! ). The room is nice and clean, but as there were 3 of us, an extra mattress was added in front of the bed, making the room a little smaller and cramp, but still there is room for us to open 3 luggages at the same time, just that it makes it a little hard to walk. 

There is a common lounge and kitchen for everyone's use, cereals and milk provided as well for breakfast! There are 2 toilets, one in the building, one outside the house, a right turn from the kitchen just few steps away. Towels and toiletries are provided as well. However, as it is a shared toilet, it gets a little messy and dirty over the days.

We stayed for 4 days and generally it was a quite a pleasant stay and the room is cosy enough. Just a note, our room is next to the main entrance so it gets a little noisy when people come in and exit the house."
2018-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,22346270,Albert,Sam was very responsive and friendly. The room was well furnished and kept clean. Enjoyed my stay here!
2018-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,21999107,Jessica,"This was by far the best Airbnb Experience we have ever had! Neil and Jane's place is a DREAM, the accommodations, the beach, the restaurants nearby, the ferry, the cliff walks!  We literally kept pinching ourselves because we couldn't believe we were living (and could afford) such a luxury vacation in a luxury paradise! 
We cannot say enough wonderful things about this rental.  It is absolutely a decision you will not regret, we loved the place so much, that we never even got out and explored the city.  We truly just thought that it couldn't be better then exactly where we were.  An absolutely perfect relaxing and splendid holiday.  
Many thanks to you, Neil and Jane!"

It is located in a fantastic spot, we were easily able to access Sydney's beautiful southern beaches as well as the city and many of Sydney's major sights. Sharon was lovely to deal with and happily accommodated our last minute request for additional guests and even went out of her way to return items that we had left behind. We had a lovely stay and we would happily stay again (I highly recommend this home for young families - my children just loved the chickens!)."

The apartment is wonderfully spacious, clean and well equipped and has the most stunning views of Tamarama.

2017-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Stephanie,Great location. Good sized room and bed. Bathrooms are good but could do with having a mop available to clear the floor after a house full of people have used them as the floor gets covered in water for the rest of the day. The cereal for breakfast in the mornings is great. Only gripe is that there was no laundry facilities available. All in all very pleasant.

We enjoyed breakfast at the local beach cafe, and swimming in the rock pool,literally across the road.
We arrived in the dark,from the airport, tired and disheveled , but were welcomed into this comfortable apartment with minimum of fuss, and awoke in the morning to a view of the sparkling ocean.
Thank you Fred and Bernadette for our 1st very positive introduction to AirBNB."

Handy to the buses and light rail system, but there is a bit of a uphill hike if you get off at the Glebe Station - it's a much easier walk if you get off at Jubliee Park Station.
She was very easy to deal with and flexible with the time to meet us and responded to messages promptly during our stay. Was a great space with all the amenities that you need, plus more - our wee girl loved all the toys and books (Thanks for having these available)."

2017-11-07T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Annette,"This apartment was huge and in an excellent location.  You can walk to most major sites within 15 minutes. The TV and wifi worked really well and there were plenty of places nearby to buy food at restaurants and grocery stores. Danny was very nice and easy to communicate with. However, while this apartment can be a great value for a large group, it was a little rough around the edges. For example, the oven was caked with grease and there was an old carpet and doors on the balcony. Also, there were supplies to repair the drawer rollers in the bedroom. However, my 8 year old pulled a drawer out on her foot which took us to the ER for an afternoon so I'm thinking the repair hadn't been completed. Overall a good value and good apartment, but we found it to be a little less excellent than we expected."
2017-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,15745971,Arno,This place is very nice place to stay. We stayed here for two nights with 5 adults & one toddler. The hosts are very quick in communication which was very good. Only one small issue was WiFi which can be slow at times but I think that’s due to many devices using it at same time but that didn’t worry us much anyway. We loved our stay here.

Fresh fruit, dairy products and bread provided and asked what we’d like pre-arrival. In addition to fresh flowers, an amazingly stocked kitchen, and a great place which was so clean - our hosts provided a range of toys (and kitchen utensils) for our toddler which were very well received. She loved playing in the garden and we enjoyed our bbqs while she was asleep in the evening! Thanks for a wonderful weekend"

Check in and check out was easy and communication was good.
The apartment caters for your basic needs and has a nice little courtyard, and is clean.
A couple of things to note: there is no iron available (as per Elise's advertisement - but I forgot to check this when making the booking). There is a bit of noise from the upstairs tenants and from the street as the apartment/bedroom is located along the street path. We were out of the apartment most of the time anyway but just something we noticed.
Overall, affordable, clean and in a a great location."
2016-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Jessica,"Perfect host! Vickie was so helpful and full of great recommendations.

Great coffee across the road at Bottega Del Vino (and that's coming from a melbourner).
Across the road from Woolworths, lovely bookshop down the road and great restaurants on your doorstep!

2018-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,18620288,Sue,"106 High Street was easy to find and a fantastic location.  We loved having a harbour view and being just a short walk from North shore wharf.  Milsom's wharf was beautiful too, tucked away in a secluded inlet where you could sip coffee, eat and enjoy clear skies and local boat activity. The local theatre had some amazing performances so we did not need to venture far.  Local eateries were of a high standard, although we were glad to find the local Aldi in North Sydney to help out with budget constraints!  We were able to run around Kiribilli and under the Bridge as well as over it.  A beautiful city and very pleased we stayed on this side. Stephen was very helpful and was on hand to ensure our stay was memorable. Many thanks from us UK visitors."

My Daughter and I visited the Avalon Beach apartments for a week. On Arrival - When we arrived we found to our delight a superb selection of Freshly baked bakery Bread, Premium Fruit (including mango, rock melon, blue berries and raspberries), Yogurt and the milk of our choice. We asked for an early check in which at this time of year (January)they could not do but to compensate there was a bottle of French Champagne in the fridge and a bottle of Aussie Red on the counter. But this was to be the first of many surprises. I then discovered a lovely selection of premium cheeses in the crisper. As well as selection of unopened French jams and spreads just added to the already extensive pantry. The kitchen – every need or requirement had been carefully thought of. Every type of glassware and china in the cupboards was of the highest standards in design and style and again very generously provided. The kitchen appliances, fridge, washer/Dryer, stove was all of the highest specification and all as new. Entertaining was a so easy. The generous designer lounge spilled out onto the terrace. State of the art technology provided many hours immersed in the latest movies. The windows featured an electronic block out blind for privacy and to mange the sun. Internally a thoughtful arrangement of blinds managed the totally privacy of the areas. Again, premium appliance including a Bose sound System and Jet Master Fireplace. Designer furniture, Interiors books and magazines. Picture windows opening on to the stunning tropical garden. As well as delightful collection of original artwork from the region. The Terrace – again every need had been carefully thought of. Centering on a delightful table for 8 the designer flagstone floor flowed seamlessly via concertina doors opening into the lounge. A huge 4 burner BBQ, ceiling mounted outdoor heating. Generous collection of Comfortable premium garden furniture to enjoy the stunning garden. Stylish beach mats provided. In the main bed room good design was again present in everything they had chosen. The premium beds and linen and towels were all immaculate. Stylish bathroom, double sink and huge European bath, heated towel rails, hair straightener and hair dryer, Spare Razors, makeup removal pads, cue tips and designer toiletries. – again, everything carefully provided. Double hanging and 30 black velvet covered hangers – generosity again. A fresh arrangement of orchids on the Dresser. Generous selection of fresh designer Turkish towels and Beach bags. Generous designer bath and beach towels provided. The second bedroom featured a double bed and again generous hanging and storage. It features a generous library of classics and current design and food books that kept me entertained for hours. Another large stylish en-suite bathroom with every need again considered. Again all immaculate. Local area recommendations for everything we could need in restaurants and cafés was provided in Blue Binder..."

2015-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Margherita,"The house is located in a very special area of Sydney. Newtown is the beating heart of the underground scene and you have everything you need.

The house is conveniently located 5 min away from the Newtown station and it's basic but very clean. We didn't meet the host, neither all the other guests in the house but we didn't have a problem.

The room was really spacious and although we were expecting the third bed to be a real bed, my dad slept well on the floor on a thin mattress. The kitchen has everything you need for a basic cook and the two toilets were clean and very new.

The room did smell a bit of mould, but it's a very old house and those days Sydney was very rainy so didn't bothered us too much.

I would come back again for a short stay."
2019-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,32361436,Grace Duignan-Pearson,"I had a great time staying with Anya, Urs and Finn. The room is light and bright with lots of space, and on a quiet road in Bondi that's still close to all the action and within walking distance to the Junction.

2017-10-24T04:00:00.000Z,16813942,Christine,"A very good place to stay, particularly if you are in Bundeena without a car as the shops are only 10 mins walk away.  Beach very close, with lovely swimming. Altogether a very peaceful place, apart from the noisy kookaburras!  Inclined to be a bit chilly in the mornings (October) until the sun was well up, as it is quite shady, so be sure to take a warm sweater.  
A charming cottage and highly recommended."
2016-06-01T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Samantha,"Arnie & Lorraine lead a life full of love. I felt right at home in their vibrant world of eclectic art and wonderful, engaging conversation. I was lucky enough to visit when they had their engagement party and had the chance to dance into the early hours, celebrating. My week in Sydney was incredible and was made more so with the friendship and welcoming arms of them both. I intend to return and highly recommend staying. "
2017-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,16551368,Stuart,Nice apartment in a great city location. The building had an unexpected plumbing issue when we arrive but Danny organised another apartment for us immediately that suited our needs. A great host.

The house was perfect for a group of friends or a couple of families.  I would be happy to stay again. "

2018-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,16964637,Nidhi,"Judy's place is a great place to stay. It is very clean, well managed and comfortable. It is 2min walk from the bus station and 6min walk from train station. Amenities are best in class and Judy is a great host. She responds immediately to any request or need."
2017-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Derek,"Victoria is a great host as she was always there to answer any of our questions.  The studio is well situated with all the necessary amenities around you.

Super close to the coastal walk which I highly recommend you do while staying here! Anita was a great host.  She met me prior to my check in time and allowed me to leave my luggage at the apartment while it was being cleaned.  She also allowed me to check in early after the unit was ready!  She walked me around the entire complex to show me all the amenities and how to navigate the area.   The unit was in great condition and was very well decorated.  I enjoyed waking up each morning to the lovely  view of the beach and ocean right from the bed. On my last day, Anita offered a late check out as the cleaning service was running behind which was greatly appreciated! Anita has great communication with her guests which was very helpful during my stay! Overall,  Anita is a really amazing host who was super accommodating!! Definitely don't miss out on this unit!"
2016-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Daryl,"A great house for seeing Sydney. 5 minutes from the nearest train station or bus stop and 10-20 minute walk to the shops and restaurants. House was fantastic, renovated recently to a very high standard, equipped with everything you need. Perfect for 2-3 couples as there are four floors. One floor is the living area and the other three floors has one bedroom and a bathroom on each."
2017-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,16609607,Jerry,A nice place with a nice distance and great view.
2016-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Andrea,Susan's place is a fantastic studio in Bronte. We loved our first AirBnb experience. They have set the bar high. We would highly recommend it to people who want to immerse themselves in the area. Take your walking shoes and soak up the atmosphere! Also so close to local restaurants and public transport. Thank you
2018-04-13T04:00:00.000Z,19508741,Raimund,Great spot and very friendly and helpful hosts. Tess and Rod made me feel right at home and the little extra touches in the apartment made me feel very welcome.

2016-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Ronan,Fantastic location and a great space for a big family. Super close to the beach and very comfortable accommodation - we stayed over Christmas and very quickly felt at home. Marcella was quick to respond to any queries at all stages of our booking and stay. I would definitely recommend her place to future guests.
2018-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,24993202,Elaine,"Mike is a great host felt special picking up the keys and having barista coffee thrown in.

The space is great the photos don’t do it justice, walking distance to Woolloomoo Wharf and Kings Cross,
clean, fresh and surprisingly quiet being in an major overpass.

Highly recommend Mike as a host and the space would stay again!"

2017-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,19739919,Sinead,Excellent value. Close to heaps of public transport and a short walk to Marrickville. A Woolies less than 10 mins away. Very quiet and clean. Stayed here for a few weeks with husband and baby while locating permanent accommodation. It is small and basic but clean and and excellent location. There is a beautiful kids park around the corner and less than 10 mins walk to cooks river. Only 15 min bus ride to Enmore/Newtown. Communication was excellent and fruit and cookies were left out to.
2014-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Joseph,"Awesome stay, felt like home. Even had the same brand of liquid soap as I have in my house. "

2015-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Sandreen,"My boyfriend and I were greeted by Angela and Geoff upon arrival and taken to the ground level of their private home  - their place looks just like the pictures!! What a great way to spend a mini weekend getaway. Angela and Geoff are so warm and welcoming and make you feel right at home from the moment we met them. Great place to stay in Palm beach, highly recommend their beautiful home! Couldn't get any better than this "

2019-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Waraporn,"Nice, clean and simple style unit, we felt very comfortable, all  rooms are good size.
Close to transport, shopping and restaurants. Walk distance to all beaches around manly, the closer one take few minutes.
Paul is promptly respond to the request, easy instructions to follow.
The place is a part of our good memories in Manly trip, we definitely come to stay again.
Only thing we think the check in is a bit late 3.00PM and check out time 10.00AM
All over I give excellent level."
2018-09-12T04:00:00.000Z,19990097,Fye,"It was a pleasant stay for me and my other ten friends from September 5th until September 12th 2018 at George's place. The photos didn't do the house justice since it's far more spacious in real life. It's perfect for big groups and family. The Macquarie Fields train station isn't that far away and it goes straight to Central Station and Opera House! George was extremely responsive including in the middle of the night. Ask for anything, he will make sure your request will be granted as soon as he could. If there's any improvement I could recommend is only the entrance. George, that huge tree in front of the house got to go mate. Anything else was PERFECT! Thank you so much George. You are awesome! Looking forward to my next stay next year."
2019-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,31461289,Jasmine,Really nice room
2016-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Laura,"My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere to stay in Sydney that was good value for money but with a homely feel and Duncan's place didn't disappoint. The room has so many little details from all the maps, the welcome information to the lindt chocolates on the towels! Although Ashlee and Duncan lead very busy lifestyles, they were always very friendly when they were around and made our stay very comfortable. The location is so convenient to get right into the heart of Sydney, just a short bus trip away (literally!) If you're considering between a hostel/hotel in the city or this air bnb - book the air bnb. It's really good value for money in a city that definitely comes with a hefty price tag."
2016-12-18T05:00:00.000Z,14223095,Kim,"Great place, host and value "
2015-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Sharon,"We had a lovely stay. The Studio is private and has good amenities. Belinda greeted us on arrival and was very friendly and helpful, and the Bundeena area is beautiful. We were there for a family function, but there is plenty to do close by if you're just holidaying."
2014-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Sarah,"We spent 3 gorgeous nights at Great Mackeral Beach House. The house was equipped with everything we needed and the quality furnishings made for comfortable relaxing time with family and friends. Great for 2 young families, perfect beach for little ones and older folks alike with plenty to do if you ever tire of just soaking up the beautiful view. Owner was very easy to deal with - would definitely recommend this property. The best part was its proximity to Sydney, but the feeling of being worlds away."
2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,29466814,Erik,"A perfect studio in the 'heart' of Sydney. Great host,tastefully furnished,neat & tidy,top location  and about a third of the price of comparable hotel accomodation. Thoroughly recommended, and can't wait to return."

2016-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Annah,"David was such a wonderful host. He met me in front of his place and showed me around. He made sure everything was fine before he left me. The place was very clean , comfy pillows and mattresses . The place is beautiful , Internet was fast , you will feel safe and secure because the police station is just right across the apartment. The location was great , convenient as mentioned. We'll book again if given a chance to go back to Sydney . Thank you David ! "
2017-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,13302796,Minh,The apartment is closed to everything. Suitable price for a central apartment.
2018-06-26T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Marcellia,"Such a beautiful place to stay! Close to public transport(walking distance to train station), airport, and nearby cafe/restaurants. Perfect place for foodie. The area reminds me of Chapel Street in Melbourne . Very clear instructions in the house, numbers of goodfood guide book to go for meals.
The room downstairs that I stayed gets the noise from upstairs, but everything else is great!"
2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,9567840,Kianna,"The Ad makes it very clear what you get. Plenty of clean towels and bedding. We had 6 people sleep across 3 double mattresses and we had enough space. Kitchen and bathroom clean and well stocked. 3 fans and two air conditioners was great to have. Washing machine and dryer came in handy and the balcony was lovely :) only downside was hot water in showers was a bit hit and miss. 

Overall great value for money"
2018-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,18130053,Bettina,"Die Wohnung von Evan war sehr großzügig, modern eingerichtet und geräumig. Sie lag einige Gehminuten von der Metro entfernt, die direkt in die Stadt fuhr. Zum Flughafen eine Station. In die Stadt - je nachdem, wo man aussteigen wollte - 2-4 Stationen. Alles in allem ist die Unterkunft von Evan empfehlenswert und die Kommunikation lief auch sehr gut. Er hat uns auch Eier und Mangos im Kühlschrank hinterlassen, an denen wir uns bedienen konnten. Die Wohnung an sich ist echt toll mit einer echt schönen Aussicht. Man kann auch sehr gut auf dem Balkon sitzen."
2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,19238057,Nobby,It was like a home away from home. We went there for a one stay but extended more than one month. Daniel and Eliena were so friendly. we would recommend this place for anyone. Train station is just stones throw away.
2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,9080393,Claire-Lyn,Thanks Lina! Great and convenient place for my staff to stay while on work. Lina is a great communicator and helpful.
2018-04-04T04:00:00.000Z,13595339,Paula,"Mariana's flat was in the perfect location for me to walk to everything. Cute neighborhood with lots of shopping, eateries, and services. The flat has been completely remodeled using high-quality materials. It's quite a small space, very efficient, perfect for a solo traveler like myself. It could accommodate two people, although the kitchen would fit only (Email hidden by Airbnb) fy bed with quality linens, nice bathroom with big tub, everything was new and spotlessly clean. It's a walk-up so you need to navigate two flights of stairs which was no problem for me."
2017-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,16261574,Laura May,Jennifer was so helpful and the apartment was perfect to stay in!
2015-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,1321603,Lorna,"Ann and her family were the most gracious of hosts, sharing their house, gorgeous food & (mostly bad) jokes to make me feel a part of the family."

2017-12-23T05:00:00.000Z,5712086,Kate,"Great location. Close to shops and restaurants. Short drive to beach and ferry terminal. House was nice, could do with a thorough clean."
2018-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Georgina,great location. not family friendly. weird damp smell in the building. quite a number of flights of stairs. very small also
2018-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,24916551,Colin,The house is old and sparsely furnished and needed some maintenance. But it was clean and spacious. It is in a good location within walking distance of Beverl Hills station.

2018-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,15960997,Cigdem,"Terry's place is lovely! The bed is SO comfy, and the living room is super spacious. Terry was a lovely host and really accommodating. Great location, just a short walk from Kings Cross and Edgecliff station and if you can't be bothered to explore there's a great pool for sunbathing."
2017-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,5763156,Jen,"Simon and Nicole were great hosts. The flat was impeccably clean and comfortable for our holiday stay. Communication was excellent for our late check-in. The heated pool upstairs is a nice touch, and the air conditioning was a good to have during the hot Australian summer days. Very much enjoyed staying here and would stay again!"
2016-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Sarah,I had a wonderful stay at Cathy's place. It was a great experience. Very accommodating and as described. Highly recommend!
2017-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Tushar,Had a nice stay!
2015-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,5347035,Tristan,"The emails with Javier and then contact and meeting with his friend, who gave us the keys, was very friendly. That was probably the best part of our stay in this flat. It does not meet the quality and standards that we have enjoyed from other flats on airbnb, whose customer service responded quickly and helped us relocate.

The photos of the flat are misleading: some furniture (like the two tables) has disappeared or been moved, some has been replaced, the two main blinds are broken, as is the shower-head holder - all in all resulting in a much less friendly and less practical feeling.
 
Besides that, we found there to be a general feel of neglect: though the flat had been cleaned before we arrived, we had to bleach the bath tub twice and scrub it to make it look not disgustingly grimy. At least its cleaner now ... The shower curtain was mouldy, and there was an unpleasant smell from the kitchen cabinets.

Finally, as the previous guest described in his comment - unfortunately posted after our booking - the neighbours are very very loud: they partied for three nights in a row until 4am, their front doors open to the corridor. We know Bondi Beach is a party place, but didn't expect it inside a residential building, and at this price for the flat.
"
2018-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,James,"I cannot recommend Evelyn's enough. She was absolutely brilliant and so welcoming. The apartment is self contained, spacious, and gorgeous. The bottle of wine was very well received and the views are second to none."
2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,20206764,Gareth,"perfect house. great interiors, location fantastic. communication from host was ideal. highly recommended"
2016-06-14T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Helen,Susan's studio is an excellent choice for those wanting to explore Sydney's inner west. Her place is close to public transport and and it's really easy to get into and out of town. Susan provided detailed instructions for getting to her place. The studio itself is cosy and comfortable. Breakfast in the morning in the main house was also a nice touch.
2016-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Bob,"This was our first experience with an AirBNB booking and we were very impressed with how easy Linda made the whole experience from getting the key, the welcoming packet of biscuits, the offer to use all and sundry within the apartment. The location was perfect for us in that it was outside the CBD area yet walkable to it. The local restaurants, cafes were great and we have no hesitation in recommending the apartment to others.
Chris and Bob"
2017-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Maria,It is very clean and comfortable accommodation. I recommend it to those who want to find a place closed to the Sydney International Airport.

2017-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Filippo Maria,"Very nice flat a stone's throw for Hyde Park, close to subway, food market, and the  hip bars and restaurants of Surry Hills.  It is a small flat but the way it was cleverly designed makes it look spacious and luminous, with a nice living room, a well-equipped open kitchen and a small outdoor area.  There are three very comfortable bedrooms each with own shower room, one on ground floor, and two on upper floors. I truly enjoyed my stay and definitely recommend this place to anyone. 

"
2016-08-26T04:00:00.000Z,13530122,Sara,"We stayed at Vickie's apartment for five nights and we enjoyed it a lot. The apartment is exactly as shown in the pictures and it's well-equipped, beautiful and cozy (the bed is especially comfortable). 
Victoria was very friendly and easy to communicate with. When we had issues with the wifi, she immediately came over and sorted everything out, although it was already 8 or 8.30 in the evening. She also gave us a lot of information about restaurants, bars and sights in the area. All of her recommendations were really good too!
We had an amazing time in Sydney, thanks to our great host Vickie and her lovely apartment. We can definitely recommend this place! :)"

2018-06-19T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Jaime,This place is charming and close to public transport. It made taking the train to an from the airport very convenient. It was walking distance to some tourist areas and close to a grocery store. I was very happy with my stay and communication was always prompt. There was a lovely touch of wine on arrival. It was clean with convenient amenities.

2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,5993432,Tom And Cecilia,"Hugo's place is great, very clean, and fabulous location in Sydney.  We especially like the closeness to the Metro station, bus routes, and cafes and shopps at Kings Cross and Victoria Street.  The nearby gyms gave me free passes...wonderful!"
2015-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Danny & Martha,"We stayed in a group of 11 and absolutely loved the house. It was clean and comfortable. Marcella provided everything we needed and more. While there are many books and household items of hers around, she made sure there was plenty of storage for us including heaps of space in the fridge and wardrobe space in each room. 
The location of the house is perfect. A very short walk to the beach but off the main drag so not too busy. Most importantly everything was as described or better. Thank you for opening up your space for us. "
2018-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,22378312,Annalyse,"The location was perfect, very central with great public transport near by. After some understandable complications with check in, Lachlan went above and beyond to make things up to us and ensure we had the best stay possible in Sydney. We would 100% go back."
2017-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,1131054,Yirong,"Spacious and clean, loved the kitchen and bathroom.    Sarah was kind enough to let us check in early, this is really a treat after flying for 17 hours!  "
2018-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,20906161,Hazel,"Ideally located next to Central Station and plenty of cafes in the area. The apartment was easy to find and felt secure.

The apartment was clean and bright with a balcony on both levels. 

Pleasantly surprised to find extra touches, such as extra towels and some toiletries also available. 

The kitchen was well equipped and we enjoyed the complimentary wine on arrival. 

Would highly recommend. The apartment is close to transport and a 30 minute walk to the CBD."
2018-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,22362742,Irene,Eleni’s house is very clean and comfortable. The location is very good. Eleni and her sister are very nice. Everything is very well!
2018-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,17944310,Jody,Host are very accommodating to your needs it is clean and tidy it is a little small so would only recommend 4 people at most
2018-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,21999107,Jessica Ngaio,"Absolutely beautiful house, just a stones throw to camp cove. Our host was fantastic and made sure we had everything we needed, even breakfast in the morning. We will definitely stay again      when in Sydney next. This listing is perfect, a must stay, ticks every box, it is beyond 5stars and it doesn't get much better than this
Cheers"
2017-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,6170899,Mark & Wendy,"Jennifer has a lovely period period home in what is like an inner city suburb. Might not feel inner city being in Balmain, but does have that feel. 

Our host is lovely and left us lots of provisions which made eating breakfast easy.

There are books to read, a daily newspaper delivered and a quick bus ride to the ferry.

A lovely time had by the four of us. Thank you.

2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,4499095,Nick,Great apartment and amazing location. Handy for everything. Very comfortable and had everything we needed. Highly recommend.
2018-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,16234640,Lukáš,"The place has it all, great location, excellent views, shops and restaurants within a walking distance, ferry terminal just at the end of the street and if you don't want to visit CBD you are in the middle of Sydney Olympic park with great walks, bicycle rides and all the rest. Moreover, you have free secure parking included in the price."
2015-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Nick,"Arnie and his wife were both friendly and helpful. The house is in a great neighborhood and is centrally located so it is quick and easy to get almost anywhere. The home itself is eclectic, charming and elegant. Definitely a good spot to stay!"
2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,22412815,Melisa,Fanastic place to stay if you are visiting a loved one at the Adventist Retirement Village. Leena was a wonderful host.
2016-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,9612902,Belinda,"Heidi was very pleasant to deal with and provided me the flexibility I needed when it came to a late checkout. 
The large beautiful home was extremely comfortable and very well equipped to suit my large family's needs. 
Her backyard was manicured abc the pool was super clean. "
2019-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,26829659,William,"This is a very modern apartment in an incredible location. I wish I had more time to explore the surrounding area than I did. The host was very accommodating to travel plans, and very responsive to my communications. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Sydney."
2018-07-06T04:00:00.000Z,25684995,Pascale,"L’appartement est très bien situé, un peu petit mais convient très bien pour 2 personne. Il est propre.
Johannes répond rapidement aux questions"

2018-10-04T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Julia,"Ziggy’s apartment is in a fantastic position between the harbour and the beach (it even has water glimpses). 
Communication and check in was timely and easy. 
It is a very clean and spacious studio apartment. 
When we are back in Manly we will stay with Ziggy again."
2019-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,22378312,Nick,"Really fantastic location, super close and accessible to the city, kings cross, bondi beach, and local amenities like a super market. However, there is no proper ventilation so the room becomes very stuffy and hot during the day and evening."
2015-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Lea,It was very nice at Pauls appartment! So central with a lovely facility! We enjoyed our Weekend. Thanks! :-)
2018-08-09T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Ziggy,"Sam should get extra positive points... when was the last time your host UNDERSTOOD how to sleep comfortably. This is the only host to use proper pillows that support your neck, thus spine, for a good sleep.

The accommodation: 
It is oddly picturesque as a converted garage situated at the bottom of the main house.

The greatness:
•Friendly residents. 
•The USB plug socket. 

Accommodation Tip: 
The towel rack is attached to the doorway between the main room and the kitchen.

Recommendations: 
Go to Church Street for those evening vibes. 

What felt missing from an Airbnb superhost: 
That welcome home goody bag feeling - this would incident a typical bathroom cup to put one's toothbrush in, cold water in the fridge, a full loaf of bread or dietary snack alternatives with spreads, an option of tea/coffee during the stay; these finer super host experience touch was being missed. However there was the salt and pepper condiments. 

The minutiae of an Airbnb feel was not felt, like a pen and pad, a welcome book with recommended foods and attractions. 

The neutral (for light sleepers): 
1. Only for the well instructed, and using your own power source. Good luck getting your Android to work with the MirrorCast device; don't forget to bring a 2A USB charger. 
2. The 6am singing from the bird wildlife for about 30mins. This is AUS, this should be expected and accepted by residence, otherwise try the CBD. 
3. The road noise in the distance (this is hardly noticed if not sensitive to sound) 
4. As mentioned by the host. The acoustics are not great and you can hear upstairs. This made it into the next category below.

The not so satisfying: 
Unfortunately as the accommodation is a conversion of the ground floor on the property, you can clearly hear the TV, conversations, wonderful chimes from the doorbell and footsteps through the front door from the property owner(s) upstairs. 
• The accommodation does not retain heat. 
• The digital signal for the TV in the accommodation always cuts off. 
• Bowls are provided :-) , but there are no larger size bowls... :-( 
• The accommodation door does not stop a cold  draught 
• The Wi-Fi is a home network. If you're able to connect, you will be sharing your devices visibility over the router during busy times with the others in the above property. You can accidentally play your music/videos to the wrong TV or speaker and shock the people in the building upstairs. This is also a security issue for the tech. savvy. 
• There's only one mirror and one sink, it is head height and is only in the kitchenette-shower. 
•The bed blanket visually looks like it has seen better days. 
• Bring your own coffee capsules for the machine."

2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,27009904,Xiyun,"Tim and Mel’s place is as lovely as it looks; even better, should I say, when you consider their hospitality and thoughtfulness. They truly put themselves in their guests’ shoes and do their best to accomodate to your preferences (within limit, of course). I had a delightful time staying at their residence, which was very close to the Green Square train station, and I would highly recommend their place to anyone looking for a comfortable, affordable and convenient place to stay!"
2018-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,15889399,Bella,"Very private location and walking distance to train.  Few stops to the city.  Gorgeous cottage, two beautiful fluffy cats to meet you each morning and one huge goldfish in the pond on the front verandah.  So quiet and clean.  Will be returning.  "

2014-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Tiiram,"We loved staying at Wayne and Kate's beautiful apartment right on the beach. The apartment is beautifully furnished and we felt right at home. Wayne and Kate were fantastic hosts and were in regular contact to make us feel welcome. We can't stress enough how good the location is, being able to walk across the road for a swim at a moments notice is amazing. Highly recommended!"
2018-09-14T04:00:00.000Z,6361929,Mariana,"Edi was super helpful from the moment I contacted her and Dion. Instructions were sent properly to access the house while she was away,and we even found the cat :) best cat ever I might say :) 
We really enjoyed how close to the station it was and close to the airport too. Location is great, security wise is amazing ,own keys for room ,plunger coffee and great stories if you around when Edi is there. Was delighted to wake up to Dion’s music and voice so thanks for that too. Will def return ! :)"

2018-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,23428550,Aline,The unit is very comfortable and it seems it has just been renovated. The location is good and also there's a car space to park. The shower is very good and the beds are comfortable.
2015-08-07T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Jane,"Fred and Bernadette went out of their way to have the apartment ready early for us after the long flight from England with our two teenage children. There were thoughtful touches like cake, juice, coffee, cereal etc ready to help us settle in. We all felt very comfortable in this spacious homely apartment. Buses into the City were easy to use and close by. A quiet, pleasant neighbourhood in an amazing setting. The view of the bay and nearby golf course were outstanding. We only stayed three nights but would happily have stayed longer."
2018-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Marvin,Shuang's place is really nice. I liked the interiors. The bed is comfortable. Bedroom and bathroom are clean.
2017-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,2838442,Lucy,"I had the most wonderful stay with Rhonda and her family. It was my first time in Australia and I was quiet anxious to arrive. But straight away I met Rhonda and she showed me round where I was living, and the local places in the area. The location was perfect, I walked approximately 15 minutes everyday to Westfields where the bus stops/train station are located. It's a 7 minute train journey to Cronulla beach too. Westfields has every shop you'd ever need and some lovely food places. 

I felt extremely welcome and comfortable throughout my stay, I can't thank them enough! "

2016-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Leah,"Susan is a very welcoming host. She provides information about the public transport, which was really helpful. She also had really good recommendations for what to do in Sydney. The Studio was very clean and comfy. The plane noise was alright. You didn't have to set an alarm so you get up early and you see something of Sydney. The breakfast was very good. There were fruits, muesli, toast and coffee or tea. All in all I really enjoyed my stay in Sydney at Susan's studio."
2017-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,8277472,Joan,"Very hospitable and quick responses to requests.

I had a comfortable stay, but would like to suggest to change the description to room in an apartment(considering it was not an entire apartment to myself). 
Thanks for hosting me."
2018-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,21637487,Pierce,"Kasey’s apartment is clean, modern, and perfect location for a stay in Bondi.

2014-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Danielle,"What a spectacular location! The apartment, the view, the birds in the morning, dreamy and hard to leave! Evelyn was wonderful, friendly, considerate and thoughtful, a pleasure to meet and Avalon and Pittwater are really magical! One of the most peaceful and special places I've ever been to."
2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,Richard,This apartment is a very stylish and excellently kitted out. It's first class accommodation in a first class location. The Manly ferry is ideal  for seeing Sydney and Manly itself has a very enjoyable spot with great facilities and relaxed feel to it.

Nice area and handy for Sydney"
2017-05-13T04:00:00.000Z,15889399,Margaret,This cabin was beautiful and exactly as described. We found the hosts welcoming and the neighbourhood perfect for visiting family living in the inner north.
2018-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,22337456,Lee,"Great little unit. Looked brand new. Overall clean and comfortable. Good location, convenient to airport, city and Eastern Suburbs. I would definitely stay here again"
2018-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Carly,"We could not have wanted anything more. The booking process and instructions were clear and any questions quickly answered from the start. The apartment is in an unbeatable location with views of Bondi Beach and an easy walk to everything. The apartment was spotlessly clean, modern, impeccably and tastefully presented and every possible amenity considered and provided. Anita was a pleasure to deal with and so accommodating to allow us to bring our dog. Honestly this has been the best air bnb experience we have ever had. Value for money in a prime location where we could bring both dog and a car made the trip a big highlight. Thanks Anita! "
2016-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,2838442,Joanne,"I drove down from Qld for the NRL grand final and found Rhonda and her family to be warm, friendly and generous hosts. They added little touches, like the care pack and the local information in the cosy granny flat, and I felt instantly at home. 
We had dinner at a local cafe on Friday night, and the food and company were great!
The street and yard are very pretty with lots of trees and birds.
I would definitely recommend this little piece of heaven, and would definitely come back!"
2019-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,22020910,Daniel,Stunning location. Very clean. Comfortable bed. Even down to the smaller touches like beach towels and tea bags. Anita was a very helpful host and easy to communicate with. Highly recommend.
2018-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,19376053,Fenta,Andrew’s place is beyond my expectation. Me and my family really enjoy our stay. The location is good. It is really suite for someone who stay with family.
2017-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Tim,"What a pleasant surprise after a string of ""less than expected"" experiences on air BnB.    

The secure parking and lifts are just the beginning.  Kerri has created a delightfully modern and stylish home that lends itself to being shared.   Truly tasteful and functional bathroom, and it was all mine.  It all continues upstairs with the perfect kitchen, a sun filled dining and lounge area, flowing  out onto large private deck with views of a vast city skyline, including the harbour bridge, which is probably ten kilometres  away.   Truly magnificent.  Yes there are some big noises from the road out front  and the jumbo jets above, but it really isn't a problem.  Kerri loves this space and who wouldn't."
2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,17606304,Kelly,Excellent value. Patrick and Christine were very accommodating to all our needs
2017-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Melissa,"Apartment shown is exactly as it turned out to be, modern and clean, the location was great and close to the cbd mall, QVB, Galleries, Town Hall stn etc. There was some traffic noise at night from cars below but that is to be expected living so central in a busy area. One downside was the hot water in the shower wasn't hot enough and the next person to shower didn't get much hot/warm water. "
2016-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,13442098,Ann Marie,Good location but no supermarkets nearby - only expensive convenience stores. There was a fire alarm on one of the days which shut down the elevator all day requiring us to climb 18 flights of stairs. Other than that we had a good stay.
2018-05-05T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Jun,Great place to stay!

2014-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,1907162,Carly,"We had a wonderful relaxing stay at a beach break and lake. The location was great and the apartment was positioned directly between the beach and lake. It was also a very short drive to other nothshore beaches such as whale beach and palm beach. The host Terri was lovely, helpful, and very responsive to any queries.  The next door neighbours were also very friendly and welcoming which made you feel at home. Overall we had a great stay and didn't want to leave!"
2016-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Sarah,"A smooth pre-stay process with an easy check-in and out procedure. We were a bit late arriving due to flight delays but that was no problem. There were a couple of hiccups that were dealt with quickly and I believe will be sorted for future guests as a result. 
Fabulous location (a bit of street noise, but that's what you get being in the centre of the city!) and I felt safe in the apartment which was comfortable."
2018-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,24863216,Carly,"Loved staying here, great location and amazing space. Has everything you need, Vivienne was quick to respond to any questions and the place has great amenities. Would definitely recommend to friends and stay again."

2018-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,17438054,Iain,"We loved our recent stay at George and Lucia’s Granny flat. The place is very stylish, modern, very clean & has all the essentials you could possibly need for your stay. It’s extremely quiet on a night too and felt very safe. 

Both George and Lucia are great hosts, very welcoming & are always available for any help you may need. 

It took about 15 minutes on the train to get into the CBD but it’s a straight line from Kingsgrove so made life really easy to get about.

Would recommend the granny flat to anyone looking to explore Sydney!"
2014-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Lynda,The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2017-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,16708536,Nicolas,Great small apartment for 4 people to enjoy all the things Manly has to offer. The convenient location close to the wharf makes it very easy to get to the city. Very nice overall!
2015-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,James,"I booked the apartment for my parents whilst they were visiting us in Sydney. The flat is a great size for 2 people, and the small study with lots of storage and hanging space was a plus too. Kitchen is small (or about average if you live in a similar period block!) but has everything needed for cooking simple meals. Beautifully furnished and a great place to relax, plus amazing location. Only thing parents struggled with was traffic noise from the street, but some ear plugs and a weeks acclimatising to city life sorted that. Would highly recommend. Thanks Paul you were a great host! "
2018-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,21851474,Shuh,Lovely guest pad that is separate from the main house which gives us privacy. The space is modern and beautiful as listed. We had a lovely and comfortable stay. Thank you!
2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,12256344,Michael,"Paul and Judith really went out of their way to make the stay pleasant and comfortable. They were friendly and sociable as well as leaving you to your own devices if you wished.

The house was clean and tidy, with a large bedroom and comfortable double bed. The room did get slightly hot some days but that was to be expected in the middle of summer and a fan was thoughtfully provided,

Plenty of space for clothes and other items in the room. Check in was very easy and I was let in by one of their friendly (adult) children.

They have two well behaved dogs who didn't cause any fuss. It was a large and extremely friendly house and would definitely recommend to anyone thinking of staying."
2018-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,19990097,Tho,"Super spacious and very homely styled house. Everything was very clean, all beds were made beautifully and George was a wonderful host. He always replied within the hour and was very helpful throughout the whole stay and even with checking out. Would highly recommend! Lovely large backyard too perfect for the big group we had"

Bus stop just at the door. Very easy to reach most important places from there.
Mohit has been very kind with us.
We have been four nights and we can only say that everything has been excellent."
2017-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,1310308,Alan,"We have stayed in this apartment on 3 separate occasions, covering a period of nearly four months in total.  Why? It is a spacious airy apartment, ideal for two people, well equipped and nicely furnished, and the landlord has been a joy to deal with on each occasion. The residents of the other apartments have always been friendly and welcoming which is a plus.
	The raison detrê of this apartment however is its location. 
Local buses and shops are a 5 min stroll, with the main shopping centre of Mosman a short bus ride or 20 min walk. Mosman has all one can want in terms of shopping, two small supermarkets, and delightful local shops where we have always found friendly and excellent service, unlike the UK. The library is ideal for wi fi should you need it. In addition there is a local free bus (2 min away) which will take you shopping, to Balmoral beach and Taronga Zoo.  
The Ferry stop to the City is but a 15 min walk or 2 min bus ride.
We cannot recommend this apartment highly enough, for either a short or long stays. We will continue to return here as long as we are able, as it now become home from home.

2018-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,22268452,Tim,The place could be a little cleaner and bug/spiderfree but bedides that the value you get is very good for the price you pay
2017-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,14223095,Sure,The room is much better than it’s advertised. So modernized. The bathroom floor can be heated so that you feel very warm when taking a shower. The kitchen is well equipped with everything. The living room is spacious. Krythia leads a very healthy lifestyle and she goes out regularly to attend different activities. She goes to the gym regularly. We had a good chat and felt so comfortable in her house.
2018-01-31T05:00:00.000Z,21127680,Ashley,Coffee was extremely helpful and responsive. Her place was very clean and centrally located. Would definitely recommend :)
2018-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,2838442,James,"Granny flat accommodation close to Miranda/Sutherland exactly as described. 

Perfect for a few nights. Friendly communicative hosts, would recommend."
2012-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,394428,Julie,Stayed with Kerri as we needed somewhere close to the family (who have grown too much to fit us into their small house). Beautiful apartment and a lovely bedroom and bathroom for our use.  Kerri is a great host and a really nice person - with excellent taste.  We'd be happy to recommend her place to anyone and be happy to stay there again.
2018-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,18616850,Julie,"This cottage was quintessential Paddington. Very centrally located , very clean, and the flowers and starched white sheets were a special and unexpected treat. Only thing that surprised us was the  bedroom and bathroom were on different levels.  We loved our stay and would highly recommend this cottage. "
2018-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Joy,Great location !!!!!
2019-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,2900140,Andrew,"Had a great stay here. Very quick and informative responses to messages and questions. Description in ad very accurate. Literally 2 minutes to a great beach. 5 mins max walk to shops/cafes.  15 minute walk to other side of Newport. 
Thank you Anne."
2018-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,6404761,Lynette,Robyn was very welcoming and made sure that I was comfortable and warm as it had just turned very cold! Cosy bed. Very good value. Good central position. Lovely host!
2019-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,17829178,Yin,"This is an amazing modern creatively designed studio! We absolutely loved the interiors and thought put into making this space work. All the small bonus touches really made it feel like an hotel experience. The location is close enough to shops and cafes yet is still nestled amongst a quiet residential area.  Elise was great to deal with during the entire process, and communication was prompt friendly and honest. Would definitely stay again if we're in the area.  This is an absolute gem of a place if you're looking for a creative and stylish home at an affordable price point compared to your standard boxed apartment!"
2016-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,8977830,Cindy,"Hugo and Pamela's apartment is in a great location to visit all of Sydney. Public transport is very close 1/2 - 1 block depending where you are going. If you want to walk to Sydney Harbor, it is less than a mile, but we hopped on the bus each way because it is so convenient and affordable. 
Hugo will contact you a couple of days prior and explain how to access the apt. He gives very clear directions, easy to follow. He also has everything you need to know about the apt. written out in a binder, which we referenced a few times.
We loved the big windows with the view of the harbor. There's great air flow once the windows are all opened, so no worries about not having AC.
We had a great stay, and I would definitely recommend Pamela and Hugo's place.

Scenery is very good and i want wo sent some pic here to prove what i said! We regret we arrived at the lodging place ahead of schedule, lead to the landlord and boyfriend back to the house immedietly. Landlord and her boyfriend are a couple in love and they are good person.The house have a lot of daily products, from bondi is also in 5 minutes distances, it is belong to the north, quiet rest environment. If u went along the way, there are many coffee shops, were only 4 or 5 minutes distance from the bus station, the sitting room can see the sea, very comfortable, we like it so much and thank you!"
2016-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,12259367,Gaeru,"My husband and I had a great time staying at A's place. It was super cozy, clean and in a good location close to the rocks, circular quay, transit and a grocery store. A was very responsive whenever we had a question. Definitely will recommend this place to anyone visiting Sydney CBD"
2018-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,16898275,Monika,We spent one night in Terent's place and have to admit that communication between us was great. He responded very quickly to all my questions. Please was ok.

2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,David,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!  Fred and Bernadette's place was lovely and inviting.  Upon our arrival, Fred recieved us and showed us around the place.  The place was nicely furnished and information on the local sights were also neatly layed out for us.  The place overlooks the lovely Malabar Bay.  

I am confident that future guests will enjoy the place just like we did.

Thanks again Fred and Bernadette!   "
2015-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,1984069,Catalina,"A fantastic location - you could not be closer to the beach and bustle of beautiful Manly. Ward was a very helpful host, answering queries promptly and kindly leaving us a fridge full of food - very helpful when travelling with small children after a long flight. The flat could do with a little TLC, but the location and the view more than make up for this. A place to kick off your shoes, grab a beer and head straight out to the surf. Fantastic cafes and restaurants nearby too. Would stay here again. "
2018-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,16234640,Rain,"Unfortunately the entire place was infested with bedbugs, so we had to cancel our stay. Yang was quick to respond but still charged us for a full night even if we didnt end up sleeping there. Yang did not seem overly concerned about the bedbugs and suggested we use the bugspray in one of the cabinets..we did not expect this. The place was nicely decorated but a bit far from downtown Sydney and the key was inside a safe in the building (and we needed the key to get into that (Website hidden by Airbnb) was quite a challenge! I sincerely hope that the bedbug issue will be taken care of seriously because our stay would have been great had it not been for that."
2017-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Claudia,Shuang was very nice and helpful. He did everything to make us feel welcome. The place was nice and simple but with everything you needed. Very nice overall value for money.
2019-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,4448723,Melinda,"Really nice place — clean, friendly, very nicely furnished — with a fridge — cereal, fruit, bread, bread, coffee and a pitcher of milk waiting for us.  It has dishes and flatware, and a plastic tub and drainer for washing dishes. The bathroom/shower are upscale and very nice.  Michelle is quick to respond to emails and phone calls, and is very helpful.  I’m sorry we weren’t able to coordinate our respective timing so we could meet in person.  
The location — Newton — is downscale trendy — close to the metro train station, so getting to places was fairly easy.  We were pleased with our stay there.  Amazing murals and graffiti."
2018-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,21815026,Brooke,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,Karen,Location was reasonably closed to the train station and CBD. This listing is suitable for travellers who are easy going.
2017-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Jane,"Nicole and Simon’s apartment was perfect for our two week stay in Sydney, right in the middle of Surry Hills, close to so many fantastic cafes, restaurants and pubs. Also really handy for Central Station or for a walk down into CBD or Sydney Harbour.  The apartment was exactly as described and immaculately maintained. Nicole and Simon provided a very handy guide to the local eateries which was really useful. Would not hesitate to go back again. Thanks so much to Nicole and Simon."
2017-05-09T04:00:00.000Z,10091713,Kirsty,"Ben was a great host, his apartment was central to Sydneys busy CBD and near lots of good places to eat. We would highly recommend staying here. "
2017-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Cass,"Great view, its all about the view. Over looking Sydney's best beach. Perfect. Transport is a little hit and miss, it always is for the bus but an Uber is only $30 each way from the apartment to the city. Easy stroll along the cliff top to Bondi and all the eating and drinking it offers. Great location for a short break in beautiful Sydney"

2017-08-07T04:00:00.000Z,2900140,Amy,"We stayed in Unit 2, which is a different place to the pictures - it should be noted that this unit has a staircase, in case that may be a problem. Despite it being a different place, we enjoyed our stay and the location is absolutely fantastic - we left our car in the street and just walked around Newport for our 2-night stay. There's a great community feel to the area. Appreciated the fruit and breakfast items left out, as well as some choccy and a couple of beers! :)"

2015-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,6201263,Sky,The house is cozy and nice to live in with everything you need. The bedroom is clean and tidy. The host is great and welcoming. No more to ask for this price and it's within walking distance to Central. Definitely the first choice if u ever visit Sydney.

2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,23171144,Nicole,"Oriel is a fabulous host. He was super friendly and responsive and met us at the apartment to show us around.

The apartment itself is in a fabulous location with great views over to Darling Harbour and easy walk to nearby cafes and city shopping. It has a gym and pool.

Compared to hotels around it’s an absolute bargain. There’s a hefty cleaning fee but assuming that stays the same no matter how long you stay. We only stayed one night so proportionally it was a lot but if you stayed over a longer period the per night rate would be less. Even so it was still very economically priced.

It’s fully furnished but otherwise empty, and although not absolutely brand new it’s in great condition and clean and tidy. It’s just as described and in the photos."

Bryan welcomed us warmly when we arrived and provided a tour and a description of all the amenities.  The two level cottage is a charming row house in the historic district of Glebe.  Our family was very comfortable (2 adults, 2 children), it was truly a home away from home.  Bryan thought of everything to make our visit comfortable; from great coffee, to comfortable bedding.  He even went out of his way to offer a wifi connection and Opal cards for public transportation.  We loved our Australian holiday and really enjoyed Sydney and the Treetop Cottage!"

The location is perfect and the house is located on a gorgeous inner-city street across from a park.

We found Steven and Peta to be very kind and generous hosts during this stressful period, of which we will always be very grateful. The lawn and garden in front of the cabin are perfect for little kids, and there were  playgrounds within walking distance. Numerous good and affordable restaurants and cafes very close by(5 mins walk/pram ride) and I was always able to find street parking. Highly recommend and we'll be back when next in Sydney."

2018-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,27009904,Nick,"Perfectly located less than 100 meters from Green Square Train Station (one stop away from Central) this place is just as beautiful as the photos. Very, very clean and Tim and Mel are so kind and easy to chat with. They also give you your own space if that’s what you like. I had a lovely gift basket of muesli bars and crisps on the bed when I arrived. The whole area is brand new, and buildings are still going up, so there’s a bit of construction going on around the place (Sept 2018), however, it didn’t ruin my stay. The apartment building Tim and Mel’s place is in is very beautiful - quiet too!

Local tips: I’d recommend popping into Textbook Boulangerie which is about 200m away - amazing French Pastries. Grounds of Alexandria isn’t far either - hip cafe/coffee options. The new library is worth popping into as well - it’s quite a spectacle at night.

Woolworths is virtually on your doorstep too.

Thanks for a great stay!"
2018-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,27009904,Matthew,"Tim and Mel’s place was impeccable. It ticked all boxes and exceeded my expectations. Communication was great and Tim was very helpful to me as a guest newish to AirBnB.  Close to public transport, excellent cafes and shops. Great AirBnB experience."
2017-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,5604994,Jc,"Diana & Jared's is a nice well equipped Airbnb apartment located in a shopping mall, with a view on a bush and the rising sun from its balcony. 40kms away from CBD, but with all shopping facilities downstairs and a parking place that makes it a perfect location for business needs if you're planning to work somewhere around.

Not suitable for a long stay though, if you can't afford to pay for the whole duration upfront. Although my plans for a 3 months stay there were shared with the owner from day one, I discovered another booking had been accepted meanwhile when trying to extend my booking to the third month planned."
2018-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,13702313,Paige,"Angela was a wonderful host. The room was very clean, spacious and comfortable. It was very convenient from the airport! Thanks again Angela!"

The neighbourhood looked safe and is very quiet. Due to my busy schedule I couldn't spend much time at Cindy's house and chat with her. But the evening we met and sat down for a chat was great. She's kind, funny and very helpful. I wish her all the best and hope her place will be available when I visit Sydney next time."
2018-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,22536752,Shannon,Great value for money! The location is only around the corner from the library and the castle towers shopping centre which was so handy. Lulu and her mum were really helpful in accommodating. Thanks you both!

2015-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,2161945,Julia,"The house was perfect for our needs -- two minutes from the beach and close to shops, restaurants, the pub and a frequent bus service to Bondi Junction and Sydney.  The house is more spacious than it looks in the photos --  six people spanning three generations could have been difficult but it wasn't, we never felt on top of each other.  The rooms were all very nice and the kitchen well-equipped for the most part. We all enjoyed our stay, Marcella was very accommodating when we requested an additional night. I would definitely recommend this to my friends."

2018-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,22337456,Jülie,"Wendy’s Unterkunft ist sehr modern und schick eingerichtet. Wir waren drei Mädchen, die für drei Nächte hier untergekommen sind. 

Da Wendy unterwegs war, hatte sie vergessen, dass wir zu dritt anreisen und daher war das dritte Bett nicht vorbereitet. Wir informierten sie also, dass wir noch das dritte Bettzeug bräuchten. Sie hat dann ganz schnell jemanden organisiert der uns das dritte Bettzeug und ein drittes Handtuch beschaffen hat. 

Die Kommunikation mit Wendy verlief super schnell und sehr gut. Sie hat sich ganz schnell bemüht uns entgegen zu kommen und uns noch einen Rabatt gegeben für die Unannehmlichkeit. Das fand ich super! 

Das Apartment war ansonsten mit allem ausgestattet was man braucht und das Bad ist sehr schön! 

Unser Check-in lief reibungslos und schnell. Für ein paar Nächte kann man hier gut unterkommen. Verschiedene Busse fahren die Straße runter und ein Schwimmbad sowie ein Fitnessraum bietet die Unterkunft auch. 

Ich würde die Unterkunft weiterempfehlen allerdings nur zu zweit. Das dritte Bett bzw. Sofa nicht ganz so komfortabel ist. Daher hat man allein oder zu zweit hier sicher eine fantastische Zeit. :) ein Supermarkt ist etwas weiter, aber wir haben uns eh viel in der Stadt aufgehalten also war das in Ordnung für uns.

Besonderes Lob für die tolle Kommunikation!"
2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,24660064,Tarson,Excellent place. Highly recommend this place for everyone.
2018-01-23T05:00:00.000Z,19641701,Tegan,Great apartment! Highly recommend.
2016-10-21T04:00:00.000Z,5178277,Greta,I will suggest it!!! Definitely:)
2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,8277472,Bin,"It's my first time to use this service in Sydney, I was a little nervous, not very sure what kind of place I would dwell in, not sure who I am going to deal with,to be honest. I was totally relaxed after the initial communication with her, she is very kind and warm, she kept on informing me what necessary matters, even including parking. 

When I arrived in front of her house, which is right behind the historical Valhalla cinema at Glebe, my eyes wildly opened, her place is sitting in an old-style building with a beautiful garden, a nice bobbling fountain. 

She met me and lead to my place, when I stepped in the room, my jaws fell on the ground and it took me a few minutes to pick them up and closed. In a big room, sits a nice iron-framed bed, the bedding looks like an oil painting, very artistic. The space is much more bigger than I would expect. The owner hearted prepare fruits, snacks and even bottled water, that is so touched, everyone who lives in Sydney would know drinking water is not an issue at all, however she prepares the bottled water, when she realized that I drink more water, she prepared jags of them, you know what, she even used the food wrapper to cover it. 

The independent bathroom is also big, she would clean it up everyday, when you step in it, it looks like it isn't being used at all, there is no a drop of water on the glass door, mirror, or wherever you would think it would be.

Both her husband and herself are super nice to the guest, even though I am a horrible one, hardly communicate with them, except basic greetings. How terrible I am. The night before I go back to China, both of them prepared a farewell dinner for me, but I bailed, you can see how a terrible guest I am. 

Her location is wonderful, next to Glebe point road, It's easy to walk around the neighbourhood, beautiful cafes, restaurants, stores and bus stops are within two minutes walking distance. 

Her place is so beautiful, I would wake up in the birds' singing every morning, sometimes, her cute house cat would come and greet you.

Stay at her place is a wonderful experience, like staying at home…this would carve in my brain for a long long time."
2015-12-23T05:00:00.000Z,1584102,Lee,"We were really unlucky with the weather. 48 hrs of torrential rain. So it is a bit difficult to review the area as we just couldn't enjoy the beach or sea pool. 
However the property was lovely. Very clean and tidy. Very modern and all as you would want to find it 
Bernadette greeted us and showed us around.  Cookies resplendent on the table,  fresh orange juice in the fridge. 
Unless you have a car be prepared, as the nearest useful shop is a bus ride away. Central Sydney is about a 45 minute bus ride away but it doesn't feel that long. 
If the weather had been kinder I think this would have been a perfect place to explore Sydney from."
2017-05-03T04:00:00.000Z,13320545,Simon,"Great location, comfy clean bed and great value. Jess is a lovely, friendly, helpful host. "
2018-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Alex,I recommend anyone who'd like to get away from the tumult of the city this wonderful peaceful hideaway. They've thought of everything for a relaxing get away
2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,4076976,Orestes,"A glorious water view is what you can wake up to, and Evelyn is a respectful and gracious host. 
If you are looking for a launch pad to the beaches, this is a great pick. 
Unfortunately no full kitchen, so plan to eat out!"
2014-01-26T05:00:00.000Z,1718606,Geoff & Lenore,We had a wonderful stay at Susans little cottage. It was perfect for our stay in the city as we were celebrating a friends birthday close by. We had some lovely chats and will be staying with Susan again.
2019-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,26334724,Keiran,"Thanks for a great nights sleep in your wonderful apartment. It was clean, had nice touches that I enjoyed and was so close to Redfern station the city was not far away at all! It was secure, private and clean"
2016-06-22T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Andy,"Linda was excellent and more than helpful. It was very easy to communicate and keep in touch with her. She even accommodated for our late check in and late check out!
Apartment was excellent and couldn't have been better!

Thanks Linda!"
2016-10-03T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Erica,"Great stay at Cats house in Bondi! It was everything were after and more. Could not ask for a more perfect location. The house was clean and tidy and the bakery on the corner is to die for, we visited there every morning! Will definately stay again and recommend to all."
2018-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Danielle,Perfect place to stay!
2017-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Lauri,"We enjoyed our stay at Linda's place. The apartment was clean and well equipped. Especially the kitchen included everything we needed and two bathrooms were a blessing for four people. The bed in the main bedroom was ok and two people slept on the sofa bed quite nicely.

The location of the apartment was good. The only downside is that there is no AC; the place (especially the upper floor) can get quite hot if it's very warm outside.

We can highly recommend Linda's place!"
2013-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,1143151,Emily,I booked this for family staying in Sydney for my wedding.  My family members staying here thoroughly enjoyed their stay.  The apartment was comfortable and clean and within a great area for being central whilst also away from the hussle and bustle of the city!!  Eleanor communicated well and helped out with all our queries before and during the booking.  Thank you!
2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,25977467,Jordi,Highly recommended! we've loved our stay there. Thanks!
2019-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,31318633,Field,"Naturally the first thing that is most unique about staying at Andy’s place is that you are living in an attic/loft with 2 skylight windows that bring in plenty of sunshine! It’s not everyday you get to wake up with the sun shining down on you which made waking up very pleasant just busking in the morning light. 

Second of all, I don’t think we’ve ever been on a more comfortable bed. Every night we fall asleep so easily and soundly and every morning it takes us ages to get off the bed because it’s really just that comfortable. You have to try it to believe it.

While Andy wasn’t around in the place, her friend Jacque was and she was the warmest person ever. We were late checking in on the first night and she waited for us to get back so she could welcome us in. 

The toilets are also very extremely clean and well fitted, hot water readily available.

Andy also lives in a really nice quiet neighbourhood that isn't too far off from the city too, which is great cos travelling is convenient and you still get to come home to peace and quiet. That being said, there are plenty of great cafe's and eateries around the neighbourhood, so if you feel like avoiding the city hustle, you're covered.

All in all, we can’t recommend Andy’s place enough and we will definitely be back again soon!"
2014-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,1481361,Catherine,"Accurate description of property and located in a wonderful area - directly opposite an iconic beach! Great welcome pack with clear instructions on utilities. No problems with local parking. Easy access to beach and local shops. Great location for runners, surfers and sun bathers alike! Our boys wanted to move in!!

Highly recommended and may consider a return in the near future!! Loved it!"
2017-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,14096512,Valentina,"The best thing about this flat is its location. Overall is not as I expected it, pictures were better than the place actually was and cleanliness was quite poor."
2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,15923846,Danielle,"Beautiful house in an amazing location just minutes from the rocks. Great host - easy, quick communication and lots of great tips. Highly recommend"

Really appreciated the coffee card with 2 pre paid coffees for the local cafe! Would stay here again!"

2018-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,22412815,Andrew,Very quiet location and very close to shops like coles and woolies for essentials. 5 min drive to Blacktown Plaza if you feel like going shopping. The basic usual essentials are in the house for the stay and comfy beds.
2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,21939239,Cherie,Seriously great location and Don is a very knowledgeable host .
2018-11-09T05:00:00.000Z,19197922,Sarah,Brigitte is easy to communicate with and very hospitable. You need to be comfortable with stairs so not suitable for some travellers.
2014-11-05T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Bernard,"Kerri is a wonderful host! She is warm, friendly and helpful. She even drove us around to visit Sydney. Her apartment is nice and spacious enough to enjoy a comfortable stay. The location is on walking distance to public transportation. 
If we are ever back in Sydney, we would have no hesitation to stay with Kerri again. Highly recommend! 
Thanks for a great stay !

2018-09-30T04:00:00.000Z,22297561,Irma,"Cute. Compact. Private. A coffee machine with coffee, milk, sugar provided was lovely. Bed was comfy and really liked the pillows, not too soft, not too hard. We liked that the toilet was within the shower stall as it’s self-cleaning. A bit of a noise issue coming from upstairs which we did not mind at all. Close to bus stops and a good 15-minute walk to shops which was handy."
2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,22337456,Sherri,"Wendy’s place is nice and modern. Even though we did not meet, she responded quickly to any inquiries that we had. Up and coming neighbourhood. Convenient access to airport by Uber."

2018-07-29T04:00:00.000Z,1714235,Michael And Eve,"The location of Richards house is amazing! The views are beautiful and the peace and quiet is like nowhere else we’ve ever travelled! The house itself is well stocked with all the kitchen utensils you could want. It has been updated enough to have all the comforts you want and expect but still maintains the cottage feel. The only downside we experienced was with the mosquitos, even in winter you need to be mindful to keep all doors and windows closed. "
2018-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,22068048,Tim,"Fantastic apartment in a quiet neighbourhood, very comfortable place to stay with very friendly and responsive hosts!"
2018-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,22295354,Janine,"Tracey's place was the perfect accommodation for our  overnight needs at a nearby function. It is very new & really clean. Although it was a little difficult for the Uber to navigate to late at night - given that the entrance is via a couple of laneways. 
We enjoyed our stay and will return when next visiting our friends in nearby Haberfield."

2013-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,794910,Rosa Jo,"This was our first Air BnB experience and Gavin from the start was prompt and professional. As our flight was early, Gavin kindly made arrangements for my friend & I, to be able to check in early.  

The location of the apartment is amazing. It is literally less than 5mins walk from Central Station. The room is much larger than what we expected from the pictures, it had plenty of  room for our luggage. The apartment was clean, the room and bathroom immaculate, bed and pillows were comfortable and clean. Gavin even has a hair dryer for us ladies or guys with really long hair. 

We spent the day wondering around Surrey Hills and coming from Melbourne I need my coffee in the morning, Sample coffee on Devonshire st  and Le Monde on Foveaux St has amazing coffee and it is just around the corner less than 5mins walk.   
That evening we spent dinner with Gavin and had a enjoyable conversation while watching my AFL team WIN, GO HAWKS! 

Gavin is a great host making us feel welcome and comfortable, making sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Living in the area Gavin knows where everything is, is it spot on with recommending place to eat around Surrey Hills and its all within walking distance( I have said that enough already? lol). 

YOU MUST try the pie's at Bourke St Bakery and Churros from Movida.
As you can see I'm BIG on food. I Loved that we were only 5 mins walk away from china town, there is also a taxi depot in the next street so we had no issues getting a cab. 

If you are down for the weekend over spring head down to The Rocks for the markets and eat macarons at la renaissance café and the food stalls there amazing food!

If your a foodie like me my favourite places to eat was: Din Tai Fung for dumplings, be prepared to wait but they are worth it, Gumshara Ramen for their thick tonkotsu broth and N2  ice cream in Chinatown, Ms g's for a twist on Vietnamese food in Potts point. Around Surrey Hills Morh fish, Bourke st Bakery, Ruben Hills and Chur Burger.

All in all , with our bellies full, our legs and feet exhausted we had a great experience in Sydney and staying with Gavin and would defiantly stay again without hesitation.  "
2017-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,16167487,Adesh,"A very nice experience at this place. Close to beach, city and airport. Overall, a good experience here."
2016-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Thalia,"Millie was an excellent host and had gone out of her way to make sure we felt welcome. She was always friendly and quick to reply to our questions. Her attention to detail and thoughtfulness included a handy one-page reference card (how to use the coffee machine, where to find the light switches, etc) and some menus from the local takeaway places. 

The unit was clean and matched it's photos and description. It was a short walk from the train station (easy even with a suitcase) and there was no noise from the train line. We would definitely stay here again. It was like staying at a tidy friend's house.

The view is superb. "
2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,22337456,Bryan,Beautiful apartment a great location. The view is amazing especially if there is a lighting storm.

2018-10-28T04:00:00.000Z,9599384,Albert,"My family of four felt completely at-home in this BandB and in the surrounding neighborhood. There are great small restaurants nearby, a huge open-air market that sets-up in the park across the street on Saturday morning, and abundant transit (bus, train, taxi, uber) close-by to explore Sydney."
2015-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Brittany,"We had an amazing stay in Cath's studio. It has absolutely everything you could ever need. The thoughtful touches such as yoghurt, milk fresh bread and fresh eggs were just some of the things Cath provided us to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as it was. Beautiful clean studio that has everything and more you could possibly need. We will never be staying in a hotel in Sydney again ! Cath went above and beyond to welcome us and make our stay as comfortable as possible. Heaps of DVDs, magazines and books, fluffy towels and extremely comfortable bed and pillows ! Everything you could possibly need in the fridge and a great location to get to the airport and nearly by restaurants cafes and inner city. We loved our stay at Cath's! Will definitely be back soon!

2018-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,18620288,Andi,This is a lovely apartment with a fantastic view. It was a quick walk to the train or ferry so very convenient for getting around Sydney.  It’s a very quiet neighborhood but there are some nice places to eat a short walk away. Stephen met us as we arrived and explained all we need to know for our stay. Highly recommended for those exploring Sydney.
2018-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,21451259,Joanne,"A stunning home in a lovely location, three minutes away from a bus stop taking you directly into the city of Sydney or to one of the many picturesque beaches under ten minutes away and Queens Park at the end of the street. There are also plenty of cafes in the area which do lovely breakfasts and coffees.
It was an amazing place to take the family, we could not have felt more at home. "

2019-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,27789416,Federico,check in was a bit of a strange routine and the apartment was a bit hard to find. The apartment was clean though and had everything we needed. The apartment claims to have 2 rooms but it actually has one and a sofa bed.
2018-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,22337456,Kirra,"Modern and stylish appartments, short walk to shops and the train station. Neat and tidy. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend to future travellers!"
2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,19376053,Lan-Anh,"Thanks for being the best host I’ve ever met! Communication was quick and easy! Everything is as stated on his advertisement - in fact, you received even more than you expect! Andrew has this little cheat sheet that he provides that has FAQs and local tips such as nearby restaurants and directions to important places. The apartment was stunning! I’ve been to Sydney before and no host has been better than Andrew. Water pressure is strong and amazing (from experience I’ve always experienced showers have a little drizzle coming out from the shower head). One of the reasons I chose this place was the kitchen. There’s a full kitchen and woolies is right around the corner so it’s great to shop and cook up some midnight snacks. 
10/10 would recommend!!!!"
2015-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,4076976,Niamh,"We stayed 3 nights at the beautiful Pittwater Paradise, the apartment had a gorgeous view and was incredibly peaceful. 
It was close to beaches, and great places to eat.
Evelyn was a great host, gave us some great tips on where to go and even gave us a bottle of wine on arrival. 
I will definitely be back.

So welcoming and accomodating - even when I locked myself out of the house she was around in five minutes to save me!  I loved every minute of my stay at the apartment.  Jenny's beautifully decked out apartment is a newly renovated studio, so compact but with everything you need - including a great kitchen and bathroom.   The location couldn't be better as you are in the heart of Potts Point, which is my favourite Sydney suburb.  My only wish is that I could have stayed longer!"
2019-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,18793287,Samara,Great location in Marrickville and a very clean and lovely home.

2016-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,6046461,Tanja,"I really enjoyed my stay at Suzies place. A very, very clean, well located and stilish place to be. Suzie was very supporting and carrying and offered by the way a delcious breakfast. Also she was very flexible regarding extending my stay and finally the check out time.
An unreservedly recommended place for the perfect sydney Trip. 
Thanks a lot Suzie for being such a fabolous host!

2016-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Helen,I was attending a 2 day course in Bexley. Perfect location for a one night stay. The room was spotless and an easy walk to Arncliffe train station.

2015-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Daniel,"Wayne and Kate are amazing hosts. Their enthusiasm, genuine care and willingness to go above and beyond was very much appreciated. If you are looking for an authentic Sydney experience, this is it! Would definitely recommend their beachfront home to anyone."
2018-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,21637487,Amy,"Kasey's apartment is brilliant. The location is perfect, being right on bondi beach and close to all the restaurants and bars that Bondi has to offer. The apartment itself is very clean and has everything you need for a comfortable and relaxing stay. Kasey was a brilliant host - she was incredibly responsive and helpful and constantly offered us any help if we needed it. A fabulous stay on Bondi - thanks Kasey!"
2018-01-03T05:00:00.000Z,20906942,Milly,"Great, comfy little apartment very close to the action. Clean and new. We had a great stay."
2017-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Tara-Lee,It was an absolute delight staying here. So close to Bondi and Clovelly. The cottage is so comfortable and the attention to detail was excellent. The bed was super comfortable and there was even a light breakfast for us to enjoy. I highly recommend this property!
2017-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,2278444,Claire,Place was in the midway btw CBD and Bondi beach so location was great with a car. Bedroom and living space is very clean with living necessities and utilities like towels and printer kindly prepared and available for use. Indoor decor design was classic and contentful. Host were really nice and friendly to allow us to use every utensil in the kitchen. Great stay
2019-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,16234640,Taylor,"Place was very clean and presentable however there was only one roll of toilet paper, we had to go buy our own and there was no soap in the bathroom, we had to buy that too. Quick responses to our questions and very accommodating to our early arrival."
2016-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,2278444,Brady,"Gorgeous Victorian-style terrace, outrageously decorated with all kinds of fascinating art, artefacts and fittings. A super creative retreat with friendly hosts  and a pool out back."
2018-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,20906161,Rexie,"Unfortunately we only stayed one night, instead of the intended 5 nights. The lift had broken down and the apartment was on the 8th floor.  2 large suitcases and 8 flights of stairs for 5 nights, it just wasn't convenient so we moved to a hotel. Alexey (the host) was very helpful and quick to respond to the issue, refunding the rest of our stay. The lift was fixed the next day, but by then we'd booked the hotel already. 

On the upside, the apartment is as per the pics. Very clean, the mattress was comfy and lots of space in the apartment. Nice white wine on arrival too. The location is great, but do pack ear plugs if you're a light sleeper - right opposite Central train station, which is very busy. Also some roadworks taking place."
2016-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,888107,Stephen,We stayed 3 nights in May 2016. We had a lovely time both Wyatt and Julia. They made us both feel very welcome and we had some great chats. The apartment is close to liz of places to eat and very easy to get into the city. The house was clean and tidy the whole time we was there and We parked outside the house and it was free. Over all we had a great time staying at Wyatt house it was the best Airbnb experience we have had so far. We will for sure be back when we are next in Sydney.
2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,1584102,Joon   &,Very nice place right in front of the beach.
2016-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,2900140,Jennie,We had a lovely stay at Neiafu. The unit is well appointed and provisions including cake on arrival were much appreciated. Location is excellent being quiet yet close to Newport Beach and the Newport shopping area with it's numerous restaurants. The bathroom is quite small and a bit awkwardly arranged but everything else very functional. Hosts were lovely and arrangements went smoothly.
2017-08-06T04:00:00.000Z,19348489,Mehrab,"We stayed in Isabelle's apartment for one month. We found Isabelle hospitable and thoughtful. Her beautiful studio was so clean and we enjoyed its amazing sunlight, great view and location (close to open spaces, CBD, cafes and restaurants). In short, this experience increased our expectations regarding a place to stay in Sydney!"

2016-07-24T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Talia,"This is a beautiful room in a great location! The views can't be beat and the bed is so comfy. 

Most importantly, Naveen and Tristan were kind a gracious hosts. They had great food recommendations in the area, Naveen outlined a lovely long day trip for me to take (in detail!), and I was messaging her every 5 minutes with questions which she answered promptly and kindly. 

She even invited me to the markets with her and arranged for me to take a free yoga class in her studio (unfortunately I couldn't make it to either bc I got a bit sick)

I'd definitely recommend this place and/or stay there again. "
2018-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,27009904,Adrian,"Classy, clean and comfortable space in a modern new apartment building. 

Tim could not have been more helpful and was there to greet us, even at an 11pm check-in.

Thoughtful touches like providing ear-plugs to combat the noise from overnight road works and letting us leave suitcases there for the day after we had checked out were definitely over and above.

Highly recommended to business and leisure travellers alike."
2017-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,S,"Great place. Booked it for my family, 5 adults, including elders. They loved it, very comfortable. One of the sinks was a little clogged, but no biggie. They loved the stay and would recommend! Very comfortable, lots of space, central location, and free street parking too."
2017-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,13595339,Norliza,Mariana is a fantastic host. She is very friendly and it was very easy to communicate with her.  We love her (Website hidden by Airbnb) is  well equipped and very clean.  There were many cafes nearby and King Cross Stn was a short walk away. We highly recommend this apartment.
2019-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,21939239,Bee,"Very clean, better experience than staying at a hotel. Don was courteous and helpful, would recommend Don's place to anyone wanting to stay in Sydney!"

2017-10-23T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Claire,Nicely styled apartment in a central location for our activities. Enjoyed the leafy views from the bedroom window and weekend markets over the road. Excellent communication. Thanks for having us!
2017-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,15920870,BanHup,"Oliver is a great host and we find his place suitably located for our purpose i.e. very near UNSW. His studio is also very clean and adequately equipped. He even provided drinks, a fruit basket, ice cream etc! Thanks Oliver. We will certainly be back."
2017-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,18047246,Sebastian,This modern and clean house is located close to the Blue Mountains and an ideal place to stay for a one day trip. Well-equipped kitchen and big TV.
2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Glenn,"This apartment is well situated near Central Station and within walking distance to Oxford Street, Chinatown and many other attractions. It is well appointed with good quality appliances and products (shampoos etc). The look and feel of the apartment suggests space, and has a pleasing design. It was also a treat to have the large cable TV on hand. Nicole was very responsive and went out of her way to ensure I had a good stay. The gym was also particularly well appointed, which was unusual for these kinds of apartments. I recommend this apartment."

Just staying a single night between flights, it was super convenient for an Uber to/from the airport and Angela was very accomodating with a last-minute booking. Hope to stay here again and share more travel stories!"
2016-10-18T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Gerrit,Cath is een vriendelijke dame maar was niet gecharmeerd over onze opmerkingen over ladder en betonvloer. De buurt ligt direct onder de uitvliegroute van de luchthaven. Veel lawaai van zeer laag over komende vliegtuigen van 06.30 tot 23.00. Bed boven kan alleen kruipend bereikt worden omdat er geen stahoogte is.
2017-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,16221015,Simonne,"The place was better than perfect.  - great location ( next to shops and the best transport, great lay out, all amenities, wonderful watching the sun set. Omio was a perfect host and was focused in my helping me in every situation. Had a terrific time."

Love it ~"

The location couldn't have been better! Thanks so much for everything, I would defiantly stay there again."

2016-11-03T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Theresa,We were met by a lady who showed us in and went through accomodation. We found the place very convinient and close to everything as described. Very clean and tidy too. Would reccomend to friends travelling to Sydney.

2017-06-14T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Brian,"Duncan's place was a perfect Airbnb. Duncan and Ashlee were welcoming, helpful and made sure that the entire stay was as hassle-free as they possibly could. 

They are Super Hosts who are very experienced in thinking of the things that a guest will need, well in advance of the guesting thinking of those things themselves!

The room and apartment is meticulously clean, the location is very good for the heart of the CBD (5 minutes over Anzac Bridge /  1 bus stop to the city). 

I don't think Duncan and Ashlee could have done any more as hosts to improve my stay in Sydney. They were excellent - thank you Duncan and Ashlee!!

2015-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,5581269,Dana,Neat clean and cute. Lovely helpful host. Quiet location easy to find
2017-04-29T04:00:00.000Z,6292364,Liam,Cathy is a terrific host and the accommodation had everything we needed. The location is beautiful and only a short walk down to the water or into town.
2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,17967409,Joanne,This was a lovely place to stay with very welcoming people. They were willing to help with info about the locality and anything else necessary.  The accomodation was pleasant and airy even on hot days.  It was beautifully kept. I would not hesitate about booking here again.
2017-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,19990097,Vikrant,"Great home for a short stay ... close to everything, has all amenities that most people would need on a break. George was great and prompt in communicating with us. The home has basic facilities but offers great value for money. Highly recommend for a short  stay for large groups."
2018-03-19T04:00:00.000Z,13852692,Karin,"This is such a wonderful space, really interesting house in a great location.  We'll definitely be back on our next visit."
2016-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,1047087,Inge,"We had a wonderful time in the Garden Studio.  It had everything we wished for, good bed, wonderful shower, and more!  A tasteful breakfasthamper i.e. Cath is a great host, who reacts very quickly and let us drop of our bags on her veranda very early in the morning.  We would recommend this address to everyone!"
2015-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,3936009,Nadège,"Staying at Naveen's place was wonderful! When you arrive, you are welcomed by the very cheerful little Felix, so prepare to cuddle him! Had no problem to get from the airport to Kings Cross station and then from the station to Naveen's place, and the concierge knew I was coming, so everything went well.
The room is beautiful, the bed hard to get out of and the view amazing. Naveen gives a lot of attention to details so you will find everything you could ever need in your room. Naveen and Tristan were very nice and I enjoyed talking to them, even though I didn't see a lot of them because I had so much to do in three days.
Besides, the place is close to a lot of touristic areas. You can walk to  the museum (around 15 min if you stop at redlights, 10 min if you're not patient), Sydney tower (25 min, and you walk through a park), then continue through George Street to Circular Quay, the Opera House, and then walk through the Royal Botanical Garden to go back home. 
This place is definitly a good pick."
2018-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,27789416,Hugh,It’s a very good apartment that is located near the supermarket. So convenient.

2018-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Rachel,A great location right near the Center of Newtown. It was a very homely and welcoming space that Michele has gone above and beyond to make her guest feel welcome and safe. Especially as a solo traveler it was great to know she was easy to contact and always there to help if I needed anything. Thanks for being such a great host!
2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,884057,Gong,I booked Maree's place for my family visit to Sydney. Maree is very friendly and quick to response.
2016-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,4919014,Tobias,"Stayed there 3 weeks with one child and baby during winter and loved it. Lovely, very friendly and well organised hosts. Fantastic views of Manly and Shelly beach. Very well equipped apartment. Feels all new and clean! Everything in close walking distance: shops, cafes, restaurants, weekend markets , transport, pleasure walks, etc.  Residential parking available. 
Despite a bit of renovation noise we had from one of the units next to the apartment for a few days during the week we would stay there again any time! Manly beach is just beautiful and you get the best views there!"

2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,9810515,Moira,"A lovely spacious and comfortable apartment in lovely quiet cul-de-sac location.  Very handy to city centre, mainly caught an Uber for around $11 but could also easily walk through the botantic gardens which were right there.  Restaurants handy, Finger Wharf just over the road and a great little cafe just down on the corner of the street.
Andrea at World Apartments was excellent to deal with, very helpful with great location.
Highly recommend for a central Sydney stay"
2015-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,6033723,Ben,Jonny is an awesome host! His place is super clean and comfy! Could not recommend this highly enough!
2019-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,19376053,Kristen,"Andrew's place corresponds completely to the advertisement. Communication with Andrew was very easy and timely.

The only caveat I might add is that, as is indicated in the description, the apartment has two fans, but no AC. We stayed there during a fairly intense part of Sydney summer and we roasted. The flip side is that the double doors to the balconies kept the noise out completely. So in winter (or in milder seasons), it's a quiet (and more temperate) place to stay!"
2015-02-15T05:00:00.000Z,4499095,Maarit,"Dino's home is such a wonderful place to stay. The unit is superb: nicely furnished, very clean, quiet yet perfectly located in Elizabeth Bay, and it features all comforts of home. It accommodates four people very well. Dino was polite, welcoming host and easy to deal with. We can highly recommend staying in this place. "
2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,5549057,Peter,Brendan's is beautiful close to the beach and many shops and cafe yet still far enough to get a little peace and quiet from the liveliness of the scene.
2018-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,16964637,Michelle,"Judy's place is all that is expected, possibly more. The individual locks on doors and entry to the house is excellent and very safe. Even though there were other people in the house during my stay, I very rarely saw anyone else. I would definitely stay here again."

The apartment was better than the pictures displayed. Everything was very clean and nicely organized. The view was outstanding!! There was so much to use, plates, cups, cutlery, fresh cold water in fridge, ice in freezer, shampoo and conditioner in both bathrooms, clean towels to use, extra sheets and blankets to use for the sofa bed. What an amazing experience. Thank you again. "

2018-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,David,Location is just perfect .. I have a quick response for a couple of details at my arrival so I recommend Mal’s place widely
2016-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,4164487,Andy,Duncan and Ashlee were great hosts! We arrived in a Friday night after work and as soon as we walked through the door they offered us a beer and to have dinner with them. It is in a brilliant location just 1 bus stop from the city and has a lot of good restaurants and bars on Darling Street. They were very welcoming hosts and we felt at home and comfortable for the duration of our stay. It was a good sized room and the place was clean and had everything we needed and more. They also cooked us dinner later in the stay which was very nice! I would recommend staying here very much!!

2015-06-15T04:00:00.000Z,1481361,Sam,"Very nice apartment, was right next to the beach just like the picture shows.  Bus stop nearby and the UBER service us widely used in Australia for private car service. We loved the apartment, traveled with 2 adults and 4 kids.  Wife wanted to take the bedding home because it was so comfortable! We just came off a 18 day cruise so we had a ton of laundry there was a dry cleaner that did it for $50 AUD nearby or you can do it in the apartment with the washer and dryer provided but we had too much.

The host was very involved prior and during our stay, they asked us what our interests were prior to coming and gave us some recommendations.  While there they checked on us several times to be sure things were working to our satisfaction and even offered to pickup our laundry and take them to the dry cleaners because we had too much for their unit to handle.  We also accidentally left a iPad there any they are being very helpful in getting it back to us, all we have to do is pay the cost of the until and they are packing it up and taking it to the local DHL office..

Very nice experience! Thanks!"

Paul and Judith are very kind and are very willing to help you navigate Sydney, they are very very sweet. Everyone else in the family was also very helpful and nice. The dogs were very friendly and happy. The bathroom was shared, but we have not issued at all. All in the house was very well supply. We really appreciate al the nice touches to make our life easier in Sydney, like the opal cards. "
2017-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,16029413,Tricia,A beautiful 3 bedroom stay. Very comfortable & the hosts supplied our family with beautiful bread & jams for breakfast for our first morning.

2018-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,13333143,Briana,Everything was amazing. I have stayed here twice within one month and it was great! Ziggy was so accommodating with checking in early for a wedding I needed to attend and late check out when needed as well. I will be staying here again!
2017-07-06T04:00:00.000Z,15806964,Hanae,"Bondi Beach is must!! Anita's apartment is within a 2 minute walk distance to the beach. You can walk to all restaurants, bars and market. The train and bus to the apartment is very easy. The bus drops and picks up right in front of the apartment. The apartment is so cute we loved our stay!! "

The hosting was great with awesome local tips."

Close to airport & beach, takes some time
to reach the city. But nearly unbeatable
concerning value for money :)"

2016-03-02T05:00:00.000Z,5178277,Liz,"We did not meet our host but she made entry into the apt easy. The neighborhood was excellent. A perfect location to access the city and plenty of stores/restaurants within walking of the apt. We were very surprised though about the accommodations in general. The room picture was very accurate and the room itself was very nice. However the apt was run more like a hostel than we expected. There were several other guests staying in various rooms and the bathroom, kitchen and living room had a very communal feel. I would bring shower shoes for the shower. "
2017-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,4532525,Alex,Great location and nice unit for my wife and I. Host was super helpful and responsive.

It felt very private with lots of little touches that made it very comfortable. It was a great find and an enjoyable few days."

Lina的房子位于一个漂亮而平静的社区,房子很新,附近几公里的地方有Woolworth超市和Chemistry warehouse,购物方便｡我在Airbnb上租了好多次房子了,这次是第一遇到华人房东,很亲切,Lina也是第一次遇到中国房客,她非常热情,给了我们很多旅行和购物的建议｡入住这里体验极佳,强烈推荐｡"
2017-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,928035,Kate,"We had a great weekend here. The house has lots of room and is equiped with everything you need. Fantastic location - 2 mins walk to cafes, restaurants, movie theatre and a delicious French patisserie. And the main shops of Randwick just up the road. We would recommend to couples, families, groups of friends, travellers or anyone looking for a great pad in the Randwick area."

2017-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,888107,Johan Hasle,"Super location in annandale, not to far from centrum with a bus leaving evry 10 min from the doorstep to centrum (often late though). Wyatt was super nice even though he was in France, and had a great system to give us the key. The house is very neat and cool design with good facilities and beds.
Thanks a lot."
2018-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,24916551,Amanda,"Fabulous family sized house! Very clean & Tidy. Well equiped ammenities. Delighted to find toiletries provided as we forgot to pack ours. Very close to train station, IGA and restaurants (all within walking distance). Alice and Richard were great hosts, willing to provide any request. Will definitely book this very affordable house again."
2017-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Sophie,Was an amazing little apartment for the weekend. Perfect views. The only thing was that the bathroom door was quite hard to shut and the fire alarm battery was dead which meant it kept beeping every so often. Would highly recommend this place. couldn't have been happier with it! Mal was great at communicating with me prior to arriving. Just need the leak on the ceiling to be fixed! :) Thanks again!!
2016-03-13T05:00:00.000Z,7926712,Laura,"Felt very welcome in this gorgeous house. Was very comfortable, spacious, clean and peaceful. Loved the proximity to Avalon beach. Had a lovely swim and walk there. 
Looking forward to another stay there one day. "

2015-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Edward,Our stay in Belinda's cottage was lovely. The cottage is clean and tidy and beautifully furnished. It was a short walk into Bundeena town and close to access to the beautiful national park. Our host was friendly and welcoming. Thank you!

2016-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Corina,"Staying at Kath's place was an amazing experience! My mum and I were there for a few days to explore Sydney. Great location just minutes away from the train station and it took no time at all to get to the CBD. It was a really nice room with a nice balcony and everything was clean. It was great that we also had our own private mini fridge. Kath provided towels and soaps for the shower as well. Kath also provided suggestions for things to do in Sydney and she recommended a restaurant called Blue Fish in Darling Harbour which was the most delicious seafood dinner I have ever had. The service at the restaurant was also amazing, we mentioned Kath's name and they gave us a free calamari dish! The view from the restaurant was also beautiful. If you want a nice seafood dish I would definitely recommend it! Overall the experience was lovely and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if I'm ever back in Sydney. Thanks Kath! "
2018-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,5549057,Aj,Brendan is easily one of the most nicest and hospitable hosts I’ve come across using AirBnB. His place was immaculate and contemporary. Highly recommended.

2015-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,6046461,Pierre,"A gorgeous and stylish apartment perfectly located for business or fun right in the heart of Sydney. Suzie is a delightful host - despite being busy with her own work  found time to provide a warm welcome and orientation tour from the stunning balcony overlooking town. Comfy bed, full privacy with own bathroom fully appointed with all the luxuries and conveniences of a 5-star hotel."
2014-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,1718606,Amid,"Sudan is a truly a great human, she is super nice and very caring. I really enjoyed staying there.

Location was great, easy to achieve all sights in walking distance....both were very friendly and helpfull and when it came to picking up our rental car at the airport, Tris was giving us a ride...isn't this nice??? Thank you again for the time and for the hospitality. Stay in touch. Xoxo Bettina & Sam"

He is very relaxed and this place was realy nice to stay.
Great bathroom and friendly quiet neighbourhood.  Easy to go to from this place to go to the centre as well."

Thanks for everything!"
2015-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,9098095,Felicia,"We had such a lovely time at this charming authentic train carriage. The train car had so much history and was such a unique place to stay and is nestled in a tranquil green setting surrounded by trees. 
From the moment we got there Margaret and her husband were  welcoming and gracious hosts. The little touches were fantastic and the fixings for breakfast were a welcome and lovely surprise. I would highly recommend this place. "
2018-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Janet,"The flat got everything I needed. The neighbourhood is very quiet at night, but it is also quite close to the Newtown city centre. You can see the graffiti on the house when walking to train station. Just the bathroom is actually outside of the room which you will need to step to the hallway. Other things look fine and nice."
2016-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,4532525,Almuth,"From the moment I have booked the apartment Linda has always replied to messages immediately. She answered quickly whatever question I had. The location of the apartment is great since it's only about 5min walk to the train station. Food shops are not far away either. The apartment has all you need and it is in particular nice that you can use everything in there (like tea, jam, butter, oil etc). I loved the one balcony with morning sun. One of the best things were the instructions and recommendations she put together and provided in the apartment. So you could go back to this document and read what sights you should visit, where the garbage room is, what you have to do when checking out etc. Thanks so much Linda, you are a great host!!! I can definitely recommend the apartment to others."
2015-12-19T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Susanne & Martin,"Susan's studio in Bronte is a jewel. Located in her beautiful garden, the studio was just the perfect place for our stay in Sydney. Super well equipped with everything you need. Not only is the place beautiful, Susan is also the perfect host. Very sweet, caring and always there to help when you need anything. Thank you. "

Unbedingt zu empfehlen!"

2014-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Leah,"My 4 night stay at Garden Studio was a lovely, tranquil experience.  On arrival I was greeted at the front gate by the fragrance of frangipanis, my favourite!  The studio has been cleverly designed and has a crispy clean, fresh, airy feel to it.  Cath was the perfect host who was there if I needed anything while also giving me a sense of privacy.  All your needs are met at The Garden Studio with extras of yummy home baked ginger biscuits and the morning paper delivered to your front door!  All this with a lush raindrop shower head made for delightful stay - it was a treat and a retreat all in one."

There was pretty much everything you could need (utensils, cookware, etc.) and as a family of five adults we were quite comfortable staying here."

Highly recommended. The hosts are very easy to deal with and always willing to help. We felt as if we were a part of their family. The accommodation could not have been any cleaner and well kept. TEN STARS"

2015-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Richie,"Very good. Mal delivered sheets & pillow cases to us at 8 o'clock at night (and a bottle of wine that evaporated very quickly) & remade the beds after his cleaner let him down on 2 separate occasions. We had a great chat and contact with Mal via AirBNB App or text was prompt & courteous. As a person who lives in and around the area Mal knows all the ins & outs & is very pleasant to deal with. Apartment is right across the road from the beach Bondi is a very funky area with a mix of both residents & tourists. It is a great place to just chill out & people watch or to get in amongst it. Each day you will see people surfing off the main beach from dawn to dusk. Many of you will know that the TV Show Bondi Rescue is shot down here in the Summer months. Great walk along the coastline also from Bondi to Coogee Beach (about 8 km). This takes you past the famous Icebergs Pool & Restaurant/Bar. The walk is well worth doing as is also eating & drinking afterwards at The Pavillon in Coogee (plenty of food options available & Gluten free meals as well - try the sashimi you won't regret it) Our daughter is gluten/lactose/MSG intolerant and we found all places that we ate at locally were able to cater for this. We ate at Raw Bar (my girls said best sushi they have had), Porch & Parlour (breakfast, coffee & dinner place - great tunes played the night we were there - White Stripes, SRV, etc.). Bondi Hardware (On Hall Street, shared plates/Tapas restaurant - good indie vibe & acid jazz being played when we we there) Aquabar Cafe (Next door to Porch & Overlooks Beach - good breakfast & great coffee) & Trio Cafe Bar locally. The Apartment itself is as you see it a 1 bedroom with 2 further beds available in the front room (1 bed slides out from under the other). Small bathroom but more than adequate & clean, has good water pressure & plenty of hot water for showers & great WiFi. Fridge in kitchen is excellent & heating in both bedroom & lounge also very good & simple to use. Easily caters for a family of 3 like us or 4 people using both beds in front room. Beds were good to sleep on (main bed is king size). Foxtel TV provided (basic package, so no sports, movies or some entertainment programs). Also DVD player & Sony sound dock that you can play your IPods/Phones through via Bluetooth. Buses available across the road which can get you to Bondi Junction & into the city. We used Uber extensively - X, Taxi & Black. Never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a pickup. Now for the fusspots, these comments didn't affect us nor detract from the great time we had, but some people can be more picky..."
2017-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,12954762,Abbas,"This was my first time with Airbnb and I needed a room near Sydney airport. Luckily I found a room at Shuang's place. The place looked almost newly built, neat and clean, quite, easy chekin and checkout and it was only walking distance from Sydney international airport. It had everything I needed including kitchen and a very clean bathroom. Great value for money. I would love to stay at this place again in future."
2017-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,10416859,Lyn,"A simple, clean room with galley kitchen facilities (including dishwasher, fridge and induction cook plates (rather than a stove persay) and a good size bathroom.  We were only there one night, so didn't get to experience either the room or the magnificent view (due to poor weather) to any great extent, or the other nice touches like the provided Opal cards.  The beds were comfy and warm.  Loved the spare toothbrush - as I actually forgot to pack mine!  There are quite a few stairs to contend with but this is pointed out in the dossier (that I failed to read carefully).  Also a quiet neighbourhood.  Leslie responded to any query we had very quickly.  A very good first up Airbnb experience."

I met Zed and his gf last few minutes before we checked out as they were away during the new year and they seems really friendly and nice even with just talking with them for a short time.
2018-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,15889399,Julie,"Stevens cabin is spotlessly clean, feels very secure and safe as it can only be approached through electric gates.

2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,9098095,Christian,"Margaret is a great host, and this wonderfully restored train carriage is a unique piece of history and a far more interesting place to stay than your standard run-of-the-mill hotel. The property is located on a pleasant and secluded acreage, were you'll be gently woken by bird calls and the wind in the trees. The train carriage itself is cozy and well-appointed for two guests - with cooking facilities, chairs and benches for lounging, and a private room to retire in. We enjoyed the games that were provided, as well as reading about some of the history of the railroads in the greater Sydney area. We hope to visit again soon!"

2015-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Rachel,"The apartment was perfect for a week of visiting Sydney - we were walking distance from cafes, restaurants, tourist sites, and the central train station so we could get anywhere in the city. The pictures accurately represented the apartment, which was gorgeous, clean, and well appointed - but they didn't include the view, which was also spectacular. Thank you, Nicole, for making the visit so easy and seamless. "

2017-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,13702313,Kayla,We crashed at Angela's place for a night. She was sweet and made sure we knew how to get around. There is a bus stop around the corner which made it easy to get back into Sydney. She is more than willing to explain how to get there.

2018-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,24460964,Ben,"great location for the surry hills cafe and surrounding location.

the common area was a little on the small side"
2017-01-10T05:00:00.000Z,3042637,Becky,"My husband and I loved staying at Susan's place. She thought of everything to have there in the kitchenette and we found everything so clean and tidy. The location is great and so close to the shops and cafes around Bronte (an adorable and safe suburb)! Susan and her partner had great suggestions and were always available for communication. 
It felt very homey coming back at the end of the day and we definitely recommend staying here!"
2017-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,4499095,Robert,"We loved our stay at Dino’s beautiful apartment close to popular cafes, restaurants and bars.  A short walk to nearby parks and approximately a 20-minute walk to the Sydney Botanical Gardens/Opera house.  The apartment is clean, modern and spacious.  We could have easily stayed longer!"

During our week long stay we never wanted to leave the apartment that was peaceful and zen like. We enjoyed our mornings checking the surf from the balcony and then walking barefoot to the beach for multiple swims. 

Truly it’s a slice of heaven."

The place is easy to find and access. Apart from the sound of some foot steps from time to time through the floor/ ceiling above, The place is peaceful & quiet and we weren't disturbed at any point during our stay.
Would definately consider staying there again.
Thanks"

Walked 5 mins one way to Darling Harbour. Five mins the other way to Queen Vic Building/ Pitt st shops.
Danny easy to deal with. Gave us early check in. "
2017-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,16708536,Kyle,"We originally booked two nights to stay. Unfortunately, the first night we stayed we killed several cockroaches inside the apartment. We killed a large one in the room between the two bedrooms, several small/baby ones in the kitchen, including in the utensil drawer, on the floor, and on the ceiling. Also, a medium sized cockroach got away inside the kitchen drawers. We all were very uncomfortable sleeping there that night. We had to find other accommodations for the next night. We communicated with the owner about the cockroach issue but he says it’s not his fault bugs come in from the outside. He also stated that he had pest control come a week ago. Unfortunately, that didn’t seem to do much for his apartment’s cleanliness, and then became our problem. We were not refunded any amount upon first reaching out to the owner and then also reaching out to Airbnb. My advice is take more pictures than I did. My initial thoughts when seeing a cockroach in the apartment was to kill it, in hindsight I should have taken pictures each time before killing them."
2018-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,17606304,Talya,"Lovely place to stay in a neighbourhood with lots of public transport options. We really enjoyed our time in Sydney, thank you!"

2013-12-12T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Charlotte,My sister and I had a lovely time at Cath's Garden Studio. It was the perfect little space with everything we needed. Cath was extremely lovely and helpful making sure we were comfortable and happy whenever we crossed paths in the garden. The fresh bread was amazing to wake up to on our first morning and the food provided really helped us in keeping our spending costs down. I will most definitely return to the Garden Studio next time I am having a little getaway in Sydney!

2018-04-12T04:00:00.000Z,652063,Luca Marie,Had a wonderful stay at Hernan's place. Nice and clean apartment with easy access to public transportation and very welcoming hosts. Definitely recommended!
2017-05-03T04:00:00.000Z,4471162,Mike,What an incredible location!!! The apartment is spacious and has everything you need. Comfortable bed. You can't beat the view!
2017-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Asahi,"Michele is an incredible host. She is always in contact and responsive to all our queries. The room is cozy, clean, convenient and with nice amenities. Pretty near to king street (hip venue for hip bars, clothes and food)."
2018-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,14096512,Robert,Great location and convenient access to public transport.
2018-10-27T04:00:00.000Z,7926712,Lorraine,"This was the best Airbnb we’ve experienced. Such a beautiful and stylish  space. My husband and I stayed here with another couple and it was the perfect size for 2 couples. The host went out of her way to ensure an easy stay. We really appreciated the milk, bread, yogurt, Nespresso pods and fruit placed in the kitchen for us. Awesome location with the beach at the bottom of the street and an easy stroll to the local shops and cafes. Hope to return one day soon."
2018-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,2900140,Robyn,"This host cancelled same-day of my check in as they wouldn't accept dogs even though their listing I'd pet friendly and instantly bookable.
Left stranded in Sydney, she also fraudulently asked me to cancel the booking at my end to appear that the guest cancelled and not the host.
Why? Because she would receive the cancellation fees.
Even went to the point of telling me she had contacted Airbnb and they advised her I was to cancel!

Beware of this dodgy operator.

Many others out there who are honest and operate with integrity"
2018-01-04T05:00:00.000Z,13562321,Katerina,"We had a great time! Location is perfect, walking distance to Circular Quay, to the train, bus stops,shopping and the supermarket 3 min away!

2016-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,9156574,Adrian,"Kath has really thought about how to make the experience great for her guests. The place is super well organised and spotless. It has everything you could need (even shampoo in the room, plug adapters and spare light bulbs). Kath is very on the ball, welcoming and friendly. Ruski the dog is brilliant and an added bonus. Comfy bed and only a 5 min walk to Redfern station with good cafes nearby. Will definitely stay again. "
2016-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,9567840,Sallyann,Very good instructions apartment brilliant very central recommend it
2017-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Nancy,"From the moment I arrived at Natasa's I felt at home. She insisted on carrying my massive suitcase up the stairs for me, while explaining the layout of her home. She even suggested a wonderful spot for brunch for my friend and I. (I should actually say even before I arrived since she was extremely flexible and allowed me to alter my stay to a couple days later). My entire stay was extremely comfortable. Natasa gives the perfect balance of privacy and companionship to her guests. She never once disturbed me, but was always willing to have a chat on the rare occasion that we crossed paths (we both were in and out of the house quite often). Any time I was unsure of something she was available by text and always had a quick response. The location is also extremely convenient as it is only about a block from the Petersham station where I was able to catch either the bus or train to wherever I needed to go. You can take the bus to a grocery store, but Norton Plaza has 2 grocers as well as other little shops, and is only about a 10min walk. My only regret is that I did not book Natasa's place for my entire trip! If I return to Sydney I will definitely be booking her home again, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient location, hosted by an extremely friendly and hospitable individual."

2016-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,12954762,Christina,"This is one of the cleanest Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. Moreover, despite arriving from the airport after midnight, check in was a breeze thanks to fantastic directions. The room is spacious, very private and has all the amenities one could need. Moreover, it is walking distance to the international airport. I didn't have a chance to meet the host but I would HIGHLY recommend this place especially if you are coming or leaving from the airport. Thanks for a wonderful and restful night!!"

Very excellent stay in the heart of  Sydney.  Note:  There are several Bridge Streets.  This one is between George and Loftus Streets in the lower CBD.  "
2019-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Julie,"It was wild and wet when I had an escape from the city ... was expecting to swim and walk but the space is so relaxing, and the book shelves full of so many interesting reads that it wasn’t hard to stay in and just wander in the weather breaks! Came by train and ferry- perfect start to a welcome break."
2016-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,9516607,Ida,"Philip welcomed me and my family to his gorgeous house. He showed me around and explained how everything was working, from the dishwasher to tv. He is easy to communicate with and was very helpful if needed. And he's got such a nice home! It was super clean, comfy beds, great showers and it felt like a home but also like a luxury hotel.
Each bedroom has its own shower and toilet, perfect for a group traveling together. 
Its located in one of the coolest areas of Sydney, just a short walk to Darlinghurst and Surry Hills vibrant cafès, restaurants and shops. Even a short walk to public transport. This is a great place to stay and I would loved to have a home like this! 

Cheers!  "

Thank you both.

2019-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,16651655,Theresa,This space is comfortable and has everything you’d need for a great stay. All interactions I had with Steven were very pleasant and I would highly recommend his place!
2017-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,16160263,Sophia Jean,"Justine's place was better than I expected. You really have to see it for yourself to truly appreciate it. Surrounded by tree tops and the sounds of birds, I felt relaxed the instant I walked through the door. And with up-scale amenities, it felt on par with a 5 star hotel (with all the benefits of actually not being a hotel!). Would recommend to anyone looking for a retreat-style getaway."
2012-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,394428,Twiny,"The flat is as per the pictures: decorated with taste, offers nice spaces and is very clean. The room is very pretty and the double bed has a super comfy matress- good sleep guaranteed. It was also much appreciable to have a own bathroom&toilets.
Kerri is welcoming and communicating with her was easy (i needed a room for the following day and she replied straight away). I felt comfortable as soon as I arrived, she is such a nice and warm person.
Moreover she is full of attention, I did not stay long but the bathroom had been cleaned and new fresh towels provided. It was no problem to use the washing machine (There is a tumble dryer, but also the possibility to have the clothes dry on the balcony). Just felt like home.
In short, a quality and easy stay with a fantastic host. I highly recommend anybody to stay at this place.
Kerri, I will remember the discussion we had around a glass of wine! Thanks for having hosted me."

2016-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,7132426,Karynn,Paul made us feel very welcome even though he was out-of-town.  Paul gave us great info regarding getting to his apartment and Wendy was very helpful as well.    Fantastic location and apartment was lovely and cosy and met our needs.
2012-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,310414,Stephanie,"Our stay (my boyfriend and I & a friend and I) with DJ was very conveniant. Our plane got in late which was no drama at all. The place is very conveniantly located in walking distance to all the good spots in Paddington, Surry Hills and Darlinghurst and about 15 - 20 minutes walk into the CBD. Everything was lovely and clean and the house was easy to get in and out of. DJ even provided a succinct list of dinner spots to try. 

I would definately reccomend staying here to all travellers. Thanks! "
2016-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,15312988,Horst,"Ich habe der Aufenthalt bei Cindy und Miki total genossen. Obwohl wir uns in den 3 Tagen kaum gesehen und gesprochen haben, hatte ich immer das Gefühl willkommen zu sein und habe mich total wohlgefühlt. Ein schöner Aufenthalt. Die Stadt ist schnell mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zu erreichen und trotzdem liegt die Unterkunft ruhig. Alles in allem ein sehr schönes wenn auch einfach eingerichtetes Zimmer. Alles sauber und gemütlich. Vielen Dank nochmals."
2018-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,22268452,Carla,I'm glad I didn't let my perceived awkwardness of having to walk through the bedroom to get to the guest room get in the way of choosing this property. I did nearly all my SYD travel via ferry and it was fast and convenient. Also a half hour walk to Bondi Beach and the cliff walk. I felt welcome and the bath products are great. :)
2016-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Dominick,"Exceeded high expectations! The apartment is even more beautiful and charming than the pictures capture. And the location is PERFECT. Walking distance to everywhere - especially Crown Street where there are tons of cafes and coffee shops.

Oh and the bed is heavenly. 

I'm disappointed that these guys are booked during my next trip to Sydney in November, otherwise I wouldn't have looked any further. It seems they are booked roughly 90% of the time, based on the calendar Nicole showed me...so book early!

PS - their guide book is GOLD! Best listing of restaurants and cafes I've seen in 10 AirBnB stays. "
2017-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,5763156,Marty,"A great size flat in an amazing location. Perfect access to every area of Sydney, while being far enough away from the centre of town.
Really cool bars and restaurants in the area.
Rooftop view is pretty good too!"

It's very safe, beautiful and there are cafés, pubs, public transport and a convenience store very nearby. It was a great base for our days in Sydney. We definitely recommend staying here. "
2017-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,9599384,Marte,"Staying at Potts Point at Dave’s is hugely recommended for exploring Sydney - 3mins from metro, a short walk to Botanics, the biggest navy ships you can imagine and 20 mins walk to Opera house & CBD area. Very neat appartement, stylish, great daylight, high ceilings, opposite great coffee shop, playground nearby which was great for our 5&7 yr old. Overall a really good stay."
2018-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,23529310,Ioannis,5* experience. Totaly recommended.
2018-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,16551368,Yu Yen,The space was great for a group as large as 7. Very centrally located and convenient. Probably need a pest control though.
2017-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,17223695,Paul,"Great 3 bedroom apartment on the South end of Manly Beach.  Close to the Corso and an easy walk to the ferry.  You can see the beach from the balcony, only a minute walk.  Apartment was light and airy, and just as pictured.  The common space is pretty big and very comfortable.  It was just me and my wife, so we didn't use the other bedrooms, but enjoyed some extra common space.  There is a washer and dryer, and a brand new gas grill on the balcony.  

This is the first airbnb that we have stayed in that had hotel quality beds, pillows and linens.  Very comfortable.  Only stayed 2 nights, but would go back for a week in a heart beat."
2016-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,9156574,小娟,"Kath is a beautiful hosted ,we  all like her and lovely Ruski ,a big dog .Her house is clean and warm .We enjoyed our holiday in Sydney.Thanks Kath !we will miss you!Good luck to her!"
2018-03-19T04:00:00.000Z,23650892,Damon,"The apartment was not clean and had dog urine on all the carpets. It took 24 hours for 1 of the rugs to get replaced and the new one seemed masked with odor spray. The owner told me the place was clean after the first day but the urine smell was still in the apartment which kept us locked in our rooms while we weren’t out and about in the city. It was very unpleasant even after getting the cleaning fee and one nights stay refunded to us. It was a total break down in communication between the management company and the own, but that shouldn’t be at my expense after I had just taken a 14 hour flight from California."
2018-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,22337456,Mireille,"The place was beautiful, modern and easy to get to. Its a quick ride to the international airport and there are great cafés and food spots about an 800m walk from the place. It is located closely to a bus station that can take you straight into the city and other train connections for site seeing and shopping. There is a spare pull out bed which was useful traveling with my dad and a nice little balcony to spend time outside. Id stay here again!"
2018-11-04T04:00:00.000Z,2838442,Liam,"Rhonda is an excellent host, communicated quickly, the prace was clean and fresh. Happy to recommend."
2018-01-16T05:00:00.000Z,22295354,Leslee,"A lovely apartment, very comfortable and hosts are a lovely young couple. Good value and close to public transport and all that Leichhardt brings, an inner city oasis with hidden gems. Would recommend to friends and family."
2018-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,23510317,Eloise,"While in a great location, and still a specious apartment, there were a number of items missing/not thought if that would have made the stay a lot better. It is a two stores loft but all open so no doors to separate the two beds/sofa bed which is fine but just be aware. There was no bath mat, no cups for water or mugs for teas, no milk even for a tea, towels were very small and old, and hard to dry cause no heated towel rails, beds could have sheets as well in case doona is too hot. It was fine for a short stay as we weren’t in the room much but still value for money wasn’t there."
2018-01-29T05:00:00.000Z,9701620,Susanne,"Glebe ist ein alternativer und sehr angenehmer Stadtteil und Bryans Haus liegt in einer ruhigen und schönen Seitenstraße mit alten Häusern. Besonders das Deck mit Blick auf die Anzac Bridge und das Wasser hat uns gut gefallen, frühstücken dort oder ein Glas Wein nach der Stadtbesichtigung trinken. Die Anbindung per Bus war unproblematisch, der Fußweg zum Jubilee Park (unbedingt den neuen Tramshed mit vielen tollen Läden und Restaurants besuchen!) und zum Darling Harbour herrlich am Wasser entlang und leicht zu finden. Kleines Minus: wir waren zu zweit und es hat uns gut gefallen, mit mehr Leuten könnte es etwas eng werden. Wir würden auf jeden Fall gerne wieder dort wohnen."
2017-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,19197922,James,"Good location with everything you need. Would be happy to stay here again. 
If you're traveling for work and a connection to the internet is necessary I'd recommend bringing a 4G modem, the connection got a little unreliable during peak times. "
2017-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,12370710,Lenise,"We had a fabulous time here, enjoying the positively amazing views from the beautiful window seat, sipping wine and munching chips, while enjoying the exciting passing parade of people walking along the promenade.  

The bed was super comfy, the decorations delightful and appropriate and pretty.  There was no problem with sharing amenities with Maria and Jerry, and we would highly recommend their lovely beachside home to all, so don't be shy about the share bathroom and kitchen; it worked out beautifully."
2018-01-20T05:00:00.000Z,1047087,Kristofer,"Lovely garden house with a little bit of a farm-like feeling to it. Cath was quick to respond and even though we had to leave earlier than planned, was very easy to get along with."
2016-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,3936009,Louise,"Our stay was fantastic, the room and bathroom were private and extremely clean and comfortable. The location is only a min from the train station and centrally located to bars, cafe's and restaurants.  Our stay was completely hassle free and very convenient.  "
2017-09-21T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Sue,"Michele's place was wonderful; luxurious, comfortable, convenient, quiet and private. Michele has thought of everything that makes a stay easy and enjoyable. I enjoyed trying the local pubs and cafes, and exploring the historic streets. Top accommodatin!"
2017-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,9639849,Mati,"A really nice place. We enjoyed our stay and Samanthas room was modern, clean and had a really comfortable bed. Samantha was a great host although she was travelling at the same time she did her best to stay in touch. We also received towels, shampoo, body wash and a sponge at the welcome, which was awesome. Beside this Samantha has two really cool housemates who are friendly and helpful. The busses and trains are in a walking distance of 10 minutes which takes you to the CBD, although the famous beaches as Manly and Bondi will take you more than one hour with public transport. I would highly recommend this place. "
2017-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,16029413,Paul,A fantastic homely property set in a quiet rural setting with enough local amenities nearby to get by on. The beaches and bays are idyllic and bundeena base is an excellent location to launch local excursions from. Hilde is very welcoming and a fantastic host. Thanks you!
2018-11-02T04:00:00.000Z,27009904,Alexander,Great location. Stylish apartment with thoughtful touches and good value. Can't fault it

Everything was ready and Susan is always very friendly."
2017-08-05T04:00:00.000Z,9516607,Michelle,"Excellent location. We walked pretty much to everything, all the major sightseeing spots in the city and to Central Station and Circular Quay to catch transportation for day trips out of the city. Home was clean and had all the amenities to make our stay comfortable. Also just really cool in design. So glad we choose this home."
2015-01-23T05:00:00.000Z,4164487,John,"First time Airbnb, Duncan was the perfect host,the room was exceptionally clean as was all of accomodation. Rozelle is the perfect place to rest whilst visiting Sydney."

2018-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,14223095,Peter,"Room was as described. A short stroll to public transport, Krythia communicated perfectly and also provided space for private time.  Local tips for transport were appreciated . I did not use wifi but password was also provided . Thanks, would stay again."

2017-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Hiro,"Our group of 14 friends and family has just had a very comfortable stay at Marcella’s house over the June long weekend. The communication with her was smooth, and the detailed info sheet and the house rule book explained all that we needed to know. She was also kind enough to rearrange the time for the post-departure cleaner so we could spend some extra time – which allowed me to go surfing and the others enjoy a walk along the beach. I’d recommend Marcella’s house for those seeking a comfortable/spacious place to stay close to a beautiful beach."
2017-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,1073607,Monika,I selected this airbnb on the basis of its proximity to my son's place.  Although I didn't meet tge host There was very good communication sbout getting into the premises and other facilities. I had a very comfortable night's sleep. My room was very large and the shared facilities were fine. Close to Petersham eailway station which is a plus.
2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,13530122,Loreta,"Lovely stay! The apartment was great, easy to find and get the keys. The location was great with a grocery store and cafe right across the street. The apartment had everything I needed, very comfortable stay."
2017-07-30T04:00:00.000Z,7132426,Jay,The place was perfect! It is centrally located and a short walk to the park to the opera house and the bridge.
2014-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,652063,Scott,I had a great stay here! The room was excellent and had a very nice bathroom. I would definitely recommend this Host. The location was excellent too! Right by the Beach and transportation.
2018-06-26T04:00:00.000Z,1138483,Debra,Homely place with everything you need and in a great location. We'll be back
2018-10-05T04:00:00.000Z,9701620,George,"I’d highly recommend Bryan’s house. It’s in a convenient location - handy to the tram, shops, and harbour, it was tidy and clean on arrival, had plenty of supplies to make living easy, and the deck is a very pleasant spot to relax with a good view. 
To top all of those factors off, you have Bryan who is very easy to communicate with, replies in a timely manner and is more than willing to assist when asked. 
Not sure you can ask for too much more."
2016-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,13674956,Karine,"Great location - so close to the train station, great place - nice, clean and tidy, Millie is a fantastic host.  I will be staying here again. Thanks Millie! "
2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,20767798,Saf,"Absolutely great location. Walking distance to everywhere within city. 

One thing should be mentioned is that the building is old and there is only one bathroom, so if more than 4 people live in there will be a problem. We had 6 people originally, but once we saw the apartment we booked a hotel suite immediately."
2018-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,27479560,Emma,We LOVED our stay! Location was incredible and the place itself was immaculate. Will definitely be staying again next time we are in Sydney! Everything we needed and more.
2018-03-17T04:00:00.000Z,4448723,Celine,"Me and my husband spend few days at the apartment and it was really nice!
The indidications to go there are very clear and it's close of the train station at Newtown.
It's a small apartment but very clean, all the staff we need to cook are there; I recommend this place to visit Sydney!"

2015-10-01T04:00:00.000Z,2161945,Han,"The house is very clean & roomy.  The location is excellent, minutes walking to beach and only half an hour bus to CBD.

The book collection in the living area is a huge bonus.  After a long day, it's great to read a lovely book.  Many books I have as well, so it is more like reading at home."

2014-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,2900140,Sherelle,"We really enjoyed our stay at Neiafu, it was a great weekend... Anne was very helpful and lovely, with the smallest of touches that made our stay even more memorable, like cookies and chocolate when we arrived, breakfast cereal and snacks left out and having an early/late check in/check out.

Her place had a real homely feel, very comfortable and the bed was soft and gave us a good night sleep!

This was our first airbnb experience and we would highly recommend her place for everyone to stay at... We only live in Neutral Bay so not far from Newport, but coming just for the night felt like we had got away from the hustle and bustle and we found it so relaxing, peaceful and quiet! 

We went on a little adventure on Sunday and found an amazing beach to just chill out at, so topped the weekend off nicely!

We will definitely go back in the future ;) "
2019-01-23T05:00:00.000Z,6292364,Marine,"Nice place, good environment. We appreciated the sympathy and flexibility of Cathy."
2015-01-05T05:00:00.000Z,4471162,Claudia,"Mal was absolutely fantastic!
He made us very welcome and comfortable within his apartment.
The pictures and description of the place doesn't do it justice, as it is magical!
The neighbourhood was great, cafes, restaurants, and locals were all wonderful!
Would love to stay here again!"

2014-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,1145567,Curtis,"Staying with Allison and Adam was wonderful. The place is centrally located and easy to walk to downtown Sydney or even take a bus. I was able to get in a game of cricket with Adam I had a blast coming from America this was my first experience in Australia. The place is very clean and modern love the bathroom and the kitchen is great too. The bedroom was at the top of flat very quiet, clean the bed was very comfortable slept well.

2016-02-19T05:00:00.000Z,1138483,Caitlin,"Our stay was exactly what we were looking for. The location was perfect, only a short drive to the national park and an even shorter walk to the beach. Belinda was very accommodating, providing us with information about the features of the studio as well as surrounding food and activities. The studio had everything we needed including a fully equipped kitchen and barbecue. The studio was quiet and peaceful, the perfect place to relax. We would love to stay again and will definitely recommend to friends.  "
2014-01-02T05:00:00.000Z,1321603,Michael And Minji,"We had a wonderful time staying with Ann at her amazing, historic and endlessly fascinating house. She even cooked Korean food for Minji, making her own version of KimChi! Her attention to detail and desire to ensure her guests have a great time makes Ann the consummate host. We thoroughly recommend a visit to this hidden treasure only 55min north of Sydney."
2018-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,15889399,Annette,We really enjoyed our stay at Steven and Peta's place.  A very well equipped cabin with a very comfy bed.  It's located in a quiet side street but in walking distance to buses and trainline.

2018-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,4589874,Christina,"Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt bei leonie und craige. Die beiden waren extrem hilfsbereit und sehr freundlich. Die Lage des Hauses kann nicht besser sein, sehr ruhig und entspannt, gleichzeitig war die Hallstreet mit ihren Restaurants und Shops direkt um die Ecke. Zum Strand waren es keine 5 Minuten. Wir hätten es nicht besser treffen können!"
2017-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,10423504,Julie,"What a great house. Close to everything Bondi has to offer. We loved the beach and the beach hotel.

See you next time!"
2018-03-10T05:00:00.000Z,15745971,Olivia,"Location is excellent, so close to Alexandria and the Inner West which we had come to visit. We stayed with four children who were aged five and under, and the place was well equipped to accommodate all of us (although we were out and about for most of the days). The apartment was very clean and had plenty of everything we needed. Parking spot, swimming pool, security and location make this a great option for a Sydney stay."
2018-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,16408272,Harry,Great location and wonderful space. A great way to start a trip to Sydney.
2017-06-29T04:00:00.000Z,18616850,Sibella,"A perfect hideaway tucked in a laneway of leafy Paddington. A perfect spot to relocate whilst we were renovating our kitchen with a hop, skip & a jump to my favourite shopping hub of Glenmore Road as well as the delicious Jackie's. The 3 bedroom cottage looks so pretty from the outside and beautifully furnished & styled on the inside, it made me pine to move back to Paddington."
2017-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,18315277,Alana,Perfect location! Great fit for 2 people on beach holiday. Tight fit for 3. Instructions to locate key were clear. Cleanliness was average. A bit noisy mornings and night.
